Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,100,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is some kind of miracle. It works on every imaginable level - as a heartfelt love letter to fans, an irresistible invitation to newbies, a visual marvel and a blockbuster of unparalleled emotional heft and cultural significance."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,100,The Force Awakens barrels back into Lucas' 'lived-in' universe with inextinguishable energy and boundless joie de vivre.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,100,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is not perfect nor could it ever be. But for every niggle...there are 10 things that are exactly right, and it says much that no one will leave disappointed despite going in with hysterical levels of expectation."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,100,"Rarely have age and shining youth been juxtaposed more affectingly, but that’s only one of many moments of grace in a movie that mines its resonant mythology while moving its story ever forward."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,100,"The Force Awakens reveals surprising connections, begins a few bromances, solves mysteries while digging up others, and sets a strong tone for what comes next in Star Wars lore. Best of all? It’ll make you feel like a kid being introduced to something truly special once again."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,100,"The storytelling in The Force Awakens is masterful, in that it seems to be taking its time but is always moving relentlessly forward and coming up with surprises."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,100,"Perhaps the greatest triumph of Star Wars: The Force Awakens is that it justifies the enormous hype. Working from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Michael Arndt and Lawrence Kasdan, director J.J. Abrams (“Star Trek”) brings fresh energy to the franchise while adhering to the storytelling values that made it matter in the first place."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,100,"From the off, JJ Abrams’s film sets out to shake Star Wars from its slumber, and reconnect the series with its much-pined-for past. That it achieves this both immediately and joyously is perhaps the single greatest relief of the movie-going year."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,100,"What a beautiful, thrilling, joyous, surprising and heart-thumping adventure this is."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,100,"The rollicking, space-opera spirit of George Lucas’s original trilogy (you can safely forget the second trio of cynical, tricked-up prequels) emanates from every frame of J.J. Abrams' euphoric sequel. It’s also got an infusion of modern-day humor that sometimes steers the movie this close to self-parody—but never sarcastically, nor at the expense of a terrific time."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,100,"It must have seemed like a nearly-impossible task when JJ Abrams and his collaborators set out to bring ""Star Wars"" back to life, but they've more than done it. They've made something honest and beautiful and, above all, fun, and I find myself energized by the movie and by the promise it represents."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,100,"The Force Awakens is ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental of course, but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity. What a Christmas present."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,91,"If the sequels to “The Force Awakens” are as good as this film, that will probably be because they follow the same formula: heavy on the human side, more comedy, less CGI, more fresh faces, and more delightful droids. And, yes, one must pay homage to the Force."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,90,"All you really want to know is whether it's good, right? Well, in fact, it is better than it had to be."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,90,"What Abrams has done is find and return the ingredient crucial to the original three films in the franchise that was sorely lacking in the second round: fun...There are some laugh-out-loud moments here, but also some touching ones. Happy, sad, exciting, silly — all that is included, along with the original sense of Saturday-morning-serial abandon that made what became known as “A New Hope” so wonderful all those years ago."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,90,"Mr. Abrams may be as worshipful as any Star Wars obsessive, but in The Force Awakens he’s made a movie that goes for old-fashioned escapism even as it presents a futuristic vision of a pluralistic world that his audience already lives in. He hasn’t made a film only for true believers; he has made a film for everyone (well, almost)."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,90,Abrams and his collaborators have made a movie that feels resoundingly fresh and new by paying tribute to a style and story that is decades old.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,88,"The action, from lightsaber duels to X-wing dogfights with TIE Fighters, is explosive and buoyed by John Williams' exultant score. And the movie is also funny as hell. Abrams knows how to build a laugh and fill the emotional spaces between words."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,88,"The film ultimately runs up against the limitations of its own nature.... But it’s still an exhilarating ride, filled with archetypal characters with plausible psychologies, melodramatic confrontations fueled by soaring emotions, and performances that can be described as good, period, rather than ""good, for 'Star Wars.'"""
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,88,"If Hollywood’s going to extend the most famous movie myth of the past 40 years, The Force Awakens seems a worthwhile way to do so."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,88,"Abrams understands what George Lucas never quite figured out: that we’re less interested in the science fiction future than we are in revisiting the past. We don’t really want to see what happens next in that galaxy far, far away. We want to recapture what it felt like the first time we arrived, in 1977, with a movie called “Star Wars.” We want to go home. Star Wars: The Force Awakens takes us there."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,83,"Star Wars is fun again. Fans whose love for the series was forged with the Original Trilogy will see too much they recognize (and, later, missed) not to love this effort."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,83,"The Force Awakens accomplishes its fan base mission, bringing back a modern myth with the torch-passing respect it deserves (plus some crass commercialism it doesn't)."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,83,"The ending he’s come up with for The Force Awakens feels so perfect it’s hard to imagine it any other way. In an age when we’ve all become binge watchers, we feel as if it’s become our right to immediately roll right into the next episode, the next sequel. And when The Force Awakens ends, it’s bittersweet because you so badly want to head right into the next chapter."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,83,"Snazzily directed by J.J. Abrams with vibrant effects and a busy plot that sets the whole franchise in motion all over again, The Force Awakens delivers on expectations with a fun, polished space odyssey that embraces the appeal of the originals."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,80,"Like their Star Wars forebears, Boyega’s Finn and Ridley’s Rey are brave, funny, and admirable but also imperfect, uncertain, and sometimes afraid. That is to say, they’re genuine, multisided characters with believable motivations—no small victory in a movie designed with the express purpose of breaking world box-office records."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,80,"Robustly entertaining while carrying the weight of impossible audience expectations, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fascinating, often satisfying mixture of rollicking mythmaking and fan service."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,80,"Abrams had the benefit of learning what didn’t work in Lucas’ prequels, and he’s gone in the opposite direction. He’s also set an interesting course for moving forward with this engaging cast playing new characters making their way through this beloved universe."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,80,Star Wars: The Force Awakens pumps new energy and life into a hallowed franchise in a way that both resurrects old pleasures and points in promising new directions.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,80,You would have to be practicing some pretty dark arts to not smile as you watch the iconic Millennium Falcon take off into battle one more time.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,80,The prequels this ain’t. We can all breathe again.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,75,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is not a great film, but it flirts with that designation far more often than this lapsed fan could have ever expected. If, on a creative level, what’s contained herein is ultimately the planting of seeds that will continue growing two, four, or forty years down the line, I suspect this franchise is in its best-ever state. How fortunate that it also stands alone as a good time at the movies."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,75,"The Force Awakens is half reboot, half remake, and all fun."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,75,So what’s the final verdict? A mixed bag. It’s a good start to a new trilogy but hardly the hoped-for masterpiece. It’s a solid space opera spectacle with enough nostalgia to overpower even the most hard-hearted child of the ‘70s and ‘80s but it relies a little too much on recycling old plot elements.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,75,"Ridley is the picture’s real find. Her Rey is fearless, forceful, resourceful, and with a hidden side to her personality that slowly manifests itself and will surely be more deeply explored in the sequels."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,75,"The Force Awakens strikes all the right chords, emotional and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new. Filled with incident, movement and speed, dusted with light layers of tarnished “used future” grime, it captures the kinetic energy that made the first film, from 1977, such a revelation to filmgoers who marveled at Lucas’s mashup of B movies, Saturday-morning serials, Japanese historical epics and mythic heft."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,75,"If Abrams didn't take many chances, he didn't make many mistakes, either. First, Do No Harm became Don't Mess With Success, and it worked. Show Me the Money is sure to follow."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,75,"It is good. Not great. But far better than ""not bad."" Solidly, confidently good."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,75,"Abrams makes big decisions and takes chances that command respect, especially in the very safe current tentpole film industry, but he doesn’t always quite sell them as he could. Still, as this new chapter props the franchise back up on sturdy legs, the Force seems to be in capable hands with a fresh forward direction."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,75,"Abrams and Kasdan’s respective humor and pathos push the characters beyond some of the more rote and redundant storytelling. So while it’s not always compelling, it’s always fun."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,75,"What Abrams has done is strip Star Wars down to its core components, rearranging the stuff people liked about the original trilogy and getting rid of what they hated about the rest."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,70,"By temperament, Abrams is more of a Spielbergian than he is a Lucasite. His visual wit may not be, as it is for Spielberg, a near-magical reflex, but nor is Abrams suckered into bombast by technological zeal, as Lucas has been, and the new movie, as an act of pure storytelling, streams by with fluency and zip. To sum up: “Star Wars” was broke, and it did need fixing. And here is the answer."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,70,"The movie has already blown away advance-sale records, and when you go (which, of course, you will) I bet you’ll have fun — I did, mostly. But it’s the fun of seeing something fairly successfully redone, with the promise of more of the same to come."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,70,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens steers the franchise back to its popcorn origins. It's not a Bible; it's a bantamweight blast. And that's just as it should be: a good movie, nothing more."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,70,"Although Star Wars has always been about the past, The Force Awakens is ironically at its best when it looks the future."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,70,"The reassuring familiarity of Abrams’ approach has its limitations: Marvelous as it is to catch up with Han Solo, Leia and the rest of the gang, fan service takes priority here over a somewhat thin, derivative story that, despite the presence of two appealing new stars, doesn’t exactly fire the imagination anew."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,67,"Still, as a nostalgia trip that knows exactly what die-hard Star Wars fans want and then layers in some memorable new characters, The Force Awakens is exactly what it needs to be: an old-school Saturday afternoon sci-fi matinee writ big."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,63,It exists less as a meaningful extension of its world than as a fan-service deployment device.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,63,"What’s missing in The Force Awakens – and this is a major, critical flaw – is a fresh story template, a plot that doesn’t build toward a climax you’ve already seen, played out in practically the exact same way. That’s the kind of failing that a lot of fans will overlook while they bask in the undeniable bliss-out the movie delivers. But in hindsight, as you play the film back in your mind, the huge lack of imagination and freshness become more problematic."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,63,"The shamelessness with which Star Wars: The Force Awakens replays the franchise’s greatest hits is startling. To put it another way, it’s a satisfying meal — but it’s $200 million worth of leftovers."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,63,It tells a well-crafted story; the new characters are invigorating; the old characters are reintroduced tidily. But it is also far too enamoured with the power of its own history.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,60,"When you’ve been charged with reviving one of the most obsessively beloved franchises in modern movies, is it better to defy expectations or to meet them? With Star Wars: The Force Awakens, J.J. Abrams splits the difference, and the movie suffers—in the end, it’s perfectly adequate, hitting every beat. But why settle for adequacy?"
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,60,"You can choose to understand The Force Awakens as an embrace of the mythological tradition, in which the same stories recur over and over with minor variations. Or you can see it as the ultimate retreat into formula.... There are moments when it feels like both of those things, profound and cynical, deeply satisfying and oddly empty."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,60,"Though a definite improvement on the last three abortive Star Wars prequels directed by series creator George Lucas, The Force Awakens is only at its best in fits and starts, its success dependent on who of its mix of franchise veterans and first-timers is on the screen."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,936662225,50,"The Force Awakens boils down to a couple of genuine lump-in-the-throat moments, and those are due to nostalgia. The rest? Seen it, done it, been there, and remember it — even though it was “a long time ago.”"
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,"A fully believable, flesh-and-blood (albeit not human flesh and blood) romance is the beating heart of ""Avatar."" Cameron has never made a movie just to show off visual pyrotechnics: Every bit of technology in ""Avatar"" serves the greater purpose of a deeply felt love story."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,"It's been twelve years since ""Titanic,"" but the King of the World has returned with a flawed but fantastic tour de force that, taken on its merits as a film, especially in two dimensions, warrants four stars. However, if you can wrap a pair of 3D glasses round your peepers, this becomes a transcendent, full-on five-star experience that's the closest we'll ever come to setting foot on a strange new world. Just don't leave it so long next time, eh, Jim?"
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,"Once again, [Cameron] has silenced the doubters by simply delivering an extraordinary film. There is still at least one man in Hollywood who knows how to spend $250 million, or was it $300 million, wisely."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,"This is, simply put, one of the most beautiful movies you’ll ever see."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,"A quantum leap in movie magic; watching it, I began to understand how people in 1933 must have felt when they saw ""King Kong."""
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,"Avatar's shock and awe demand to be seen. You've never experienced anything like it, and neither has anyone else."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,Glorious and goofy and blissfully deranged.
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,Avatar is entertainment of the highest order. It's the best movie of 2009.
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,"At the end of a decade defined by much bellyaching about ""the death of cinema"" (including, on occasion, by this critic), Avatar concludes, appropriately enough, with an image of rebirth."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,"Pantheism, Cameronism: In Avatar, what's the diff? Now he's king of a world he made from scratch."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,90,"Avatar is all-enveloping and transporting, with Cameron & Co.'s years of R&D paying off with a film that, as his work has done before, raises the technical bar and throws down a challenge for the many other filmmakers toiling in the sci-fi/fantasy realm."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,90,"Embrace the movie -- surely the most vivid and persuasive creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures -- as a total sensory, sensuous, sensual experience."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,90,"The movie's story may be a little trite, and the big battle at the end between ugly mechanical force and the gorgeous natural world goes on forever, but what a show Cameron puts on! The continuity of dynamized space that he has achieved with 3-D gloriously supports his trippy belief that all living things are one."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,90,"Much of the time, though, you're transfixed by the beauty of a spectacle that seems all of a piece. Special effects have been abolished, in effect, since the whole thing is so special."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,90,"Is it or is it not stupendously friggin' rad? And the answer is yes. For most of the first hour, a good portion of the second, and even many of the 40 minutes left after that, Avatar is stupendously friggin' rad."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,89,"It's thrilling and lovely and sad and explosive in all the right ways, and it needs to be seen – on the big screen, in 3-D – to be believed."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,88,Tone-deaf but thunderously exciting.
Avatar,7.8,760507625,88,Rarely less than absorbing and never boring over its nearly three-hour length.
Avatar,7.8,760507625,88,"An entertainment to be not just seen but absorbed on a molecular level; it's as close to a full-body experience as we'll get until they invent the holo-suits. Cameron aims for sheer wonderment, and he delivers."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,88,"Avatar delivers. Combining beyond-state-of-the-art moviemaking with a tried-and-true storyline and a gamer-geek sensibility - not to mention a love angle, an otherworldly bestiary, and an arsenal of 22d-century weaponry - the movie quite simply rocks."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,83,"If I never felt entirely transported by Avatar, it's probably because the story thudded just as often as the imagery soared. But Pandora is still a good place to park yourself for three hours."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,83,"Is it a great movie?  Maybe not.  But it is a great step forward in moviemaking.  Shrug it off if that makes you feel better, but starting today you live in a post-Avatar movie world."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,75,"The first 90 minutes of Avatar are pretty terrific - a full-immersion technological wonder with wonders to spare. The other 72 minutes, less and less terrific."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,75,"As visual spectacle, Avatar is indelible, but as a movie it all but evaporates as you watch it."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,75,The scenes in Pandora -- a planet with an Earth-like environment -- are so breathtaking that the narrative seems almost beside the point.
Avatar,7.8,760507625,75,Titanic technical achievement.
Avatar,7.8,760507625,75,"By presenting Avatar in 3-D, Cameron is staking his claim and building a fence around his own precious resource, making it unobtainable on any but his own terms to increasingly emboldened and technologically savvy natives."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,75,"Avatar is a king's ransom fairly well spent, not least because Cameron's invitation into his superbly crafted universe comes with an unexpected price: He makes it easy to gaze fondly on all this movie magic, but only in exchange for a hard look at ourselves."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,75,"Vast, beautiful and meticulously detailed."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,70,"Avatar is a technological wonder, 15 years percolating in King Cameron's imagination and inarguably the greatest 3-D cavalry western ever made. Too bad that western is ""Dances With Wolves."""
Avatar,7.8,760507625,63,"Whatever faults Avatar may have -- and there are many -- the movie succeeds in immersing you in a photorealistic, painstakingly detailed world more fully than any science fiction movie before."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,60,The question lingers as the movie comes to its triumphant body-swapping close: Is this a pro-environment parable or a prophecy of virtual realities yet to come? Cameron's new world may very well be a verdant Matrix.
Avatar,7.8,760507625,60,"Avatar clears the hurdle in terms of being optical candy. Its story, though, is pure cheese."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,50,"Avatar is a weak patchwork of his other films: the leaden voiceover from ""Terminator 2"" here, the military/civilian conflict from ""Aliens"" there, even a Jack-and-Rose-style forbidden love story cued to adult-contempo soundtrack."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,50,"It is a very expensive-looking, very flashy entertainment, albeit one that groans under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and features some of the most godawful dialogue this side of ""Attack of the Clones."""
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,"Black Panther could have been just another Marvel romp—a fun but ultimately disposable entry in the studio’s catalogue. But Ryan Coogler and company had the power, and perhaps the responsibility, to do much more. And they did."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,"Believe the hype: Black Panther transcends its comic-book origins, achieving a mythic grandeur that’s nothing short of exhilarating."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,"One of the year's best films, and one that transcends the superhero genre to emerge as an epic of operatic proportions. The numerous battle sequences that are staples of the genre are present, but they float on the surface of a deep ocean of character development and attention to details both grandiose and minute"
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,Marvel’s Black Panther is a milestone not only for its casting and director/co-writer Ryan Coogler’s cine-griot myth building but because it’s alive with fresh sights and sounds in a genre easily leaning on sameness.
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,"Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther is the film that will change everything. When you see it, you know that from here on in, everything will be different. Whilst a Marvel story through and through, fitting perfectly into the MCU post-Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther stands alone as a masterpiece of filmmaking."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,"On a pure pop level, as a piece of big-time mainstream entertainment, let us also celebrate this: Black Panther is one of the best superhero movies of the century."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,"A film that fulfills the most rote demands of superhero spectacle, yet does so with style and subtexts that feel bracingly, joyfully groundbreaking."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,"Say this about Black Panther, which raises movie escapism very near the level of art: You've never seen anything like it in your life."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,"While the themes are deep, Black Panther is at the same time a visual joy to behold, with confident quirkiness (those aforementioned war rhinos), insane action sequences and special effects, and the glorious reveal of Wakanda, whose culture is steeped in African influences but which also offers a jaw-dropping look at what a city of the future could be."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,96,"The arguments Black Panther undertakes with itself are central to its architecture, a narrative spine that runs from the first scene to the last."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,91,"It’s easily the best of the Marvel superhero movies but it’s also a film that foregrounds a cornucopia of powerful black faces, garbs, traditions, and conflicts. It’s a stealth movie: Like “Get Out,” it’s a genre film jam-packed with social relevancy."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,91,"There’s talent in every corner of the film, and it elevates Black Panther beyond so many of its superhero contemporaries even as it exhibits some formulaic tendencies. It’s a sterling example of formula done exceedingly well, however, particularly in the ways it uses the familiarity of that formula to tell a new kind of story."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,91,"It’s gripping, funny, and full of spectacle, but it also feels like a turning point, one where the studio has finally recognized that its movies can be about more than just selling the next installment. In the process, the studio has ended up with one of the most enthralling entries in its entire universe."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,91,"[Coogler] infuses nearly every frame with soul and style, and makes the radical case that a comic-book movie can actually have something meaningful — beyond boom or kapow or America — to say. In that context, Panther’s nuanced celebration of pride and identity and personal responsibility doesn’t just feel like a fresh direction for the genre, it’s the movie’s own true superpower."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,90,"Coogler and his talented cast and team tell a story that dazzles, one that dares its audience to dream of a world unrestrained by our own stifling reality, without ignoring how the pain of the real world informs those joyful dreams."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,90,"It is a terrifically entertaining film, alive from the start, following its Marvel mission (for good and bad) while rising above it."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,90,"The movie has a beating heart, and a big one; it’s not just sincere, but that rarest of birds in the jungle of mainstream entertainment, a heartfelt epic."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,90,"Energized to a thrilling extent by a myriad of Afrocentric influences, Black Panther showcases a vivid inventiveness that underscores the obvious point that we want all cultures and colors represented on screen because that makes for a richness of cinematic experience that everyone enjoys being exposed to."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,90,"It wouldn’t be a Marvel production without manly skirmishes and digital avatars. Yet in its emphasis on black imagination, creation and liberation, the movie becomes an emblem of a past that was denied and a future that feels very present. And in doing so opens up its world, and yours, beautifully."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,90,"Unusually grounded for a Marvel superhero epic, and unusually gripping."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,90,"Black Panther delivers the goods as an adventure film, a political statement, and a cultural celebration. It shakes off a sluggish start thanks to a memorable cast of characters going up against Marvel’s best-realized villain in almost a decade."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,89,"Yes, Black Panther is a moment. But in 20 years' time (or 100 more Marvel films), when this moment has passed, it will still be the kind of resonant, rip-roaring crowd-pleaser to which all smart action films should aspire."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,88,This is the closest Marvel has come to making a stand-alone tale in many years. Even Doctor Strange felt more connected to the larger MCU.
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,88,"No, Black Panther isn’t the greatest movie ever made. It’s probably not even the greatest superhero movie ever made. But it’s very, very good — in its best scenes, exhilarating."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,88,"Black Panther sticks to Marvel orthodoxy, and yet does so with a nearly all black cast (Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis have small roles), and with strikingly Afro-centric production design. In the process it freshens and enlivens the Marvel brand."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,88,"Like all the best comics movies, this one’s got a villain (Michael B. Jordan) so compelling he nearly steals the show from the hero (Chadwick Boseman). And sure, the futuristic African country of Wakanda may be fictional, but it’s brimming with cultural resonance."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,88,"May Marvel learn its lesson from Black Panther: When a movie like this ends up feeling both personal and vital, you’ve done something right."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,88,"Coogler is a young filmmaker — this is just his third feature, following “Fruitvale Station” and “Creed” (two fine and very different films) — but he marshals this world with confidence and flair. The action sequences are insanely fun."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,88,"Unlike many of its more hollow predecessors, Black Panther has real, honest-to-goodness stakes. As the most earnest and big-budget attempt yet of a black superhero film, Black Panther is assured of being an overdue cinematic landmark. But it's also simply ravishing, grand-scale filmmaking."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,88,"When Black Panther works, it’s thrillingly alive, whether it’s the dazzling colors of the vivid costumes by Ruth E. Carter (“Selma”)...or the eclectic and vibrant music choices."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,85,"Black Panther works best as a dynastic drama, and as a musing on global politics from a perspective we don’t often get. Despite familiar action-scene wobbliness, it’s easily the most engaging Marvel film in a long while. Because—finally!—it has something new to say."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,85,"It’s obvious Ryan Coogler didn’t direct Black Panther to make an action movie. Instead, it’s a dense movie about family, community, internal struggle, and external struggle. And it’s a movie with a lot on its mind."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,83,"While Ryan Coogler’s deep dive into the titular character’s Wakandan homeworld keeps the assembly line working, it heralds not only an improvement on the MCU, but a striking and grandiose fantasy in its own right."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,83,"There are hiccups in its ambition, but it’s hard not to get swept up in all the technologies, characters, and politics crammed into the movie’s compelling dramatic conflict, which casts the charismatic Michael B. Jordan—the star of Creed and Coogler’s debut, Fruitvale Station—as the most complex villain in the post-Dark Knight cycle of superhero blockbusters."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,83,"The murky moral dimension of the Black Panther world is wonderfully rich and complex and it gives great pause for its new king to reconcile. And yet, all this intricacy is resolved in rather simplistic fashion in the end. It’s just a superhero movie, one might say, but if you’re going to set up this fertile ground, you might want to really follow through."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,83,"Black Panther is different. It’s the first one of these films that flows with a genuine sense of culture and identity, memory and musicality. It’s the first one of these films that doesn’t merely reckon with power and subjugation in the abstract, but also gives those ideas actual weight by grafting them onto specific bodies and confronting the historical ways in which they’ve shaped our universe."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,82,Black Panther might be the first MCU film that could claim to most clearly be an expression of a particular director’s voice.
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"While Boseman does what he can with the ever-noble hero, Jordan is so relaxed and so unstiff that, if you’re anything like me, you’ll wind up rooting for the baddie when the two of them battle it out. Jordan has swagger to spare, with those rolling shoulders, but there’s a breath of charm, too, all the more seductive in the overblown atmosphere of Marvel. He’s twice as pantherish as the Panther."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"Black Panther proves how representation can rejuvenate even the oldest superhero origin arcs, allowing Marvel a victory that still feels every bit a Ryan Coogler film."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"Handsomely mounted by Creed director Ryan Coogler and starring an enviable slate of black actors that makes cameoing comics godhead Stan Lee almost seem lost, the film is provocative and satisfying in ways that are long overdue, like its ornate, culturally dense production design and the deeper subtexts of honor, compassion and destiny."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"Written by Coogler and Joe Robert Cole, Black Panther brings grounded history — in Black History Month, no less — to a fantastical story, carefully considering the world in which the characters reside."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"Grumpy T'Challa may be on the throne, but it’s the women who rule. And Michael B. Jordan adds fire as Killmonger."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"The movie is smart, lavish and fun without being assaultive."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"Confident, assured and athletic filmmaking. And with Boseman on such dignified, dynamic form, his Infinity War return can’t come soon enough."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"Historical significance aside, what superhero fans want to know is how “Black Panther” compares with other Marvel movies. Simply put, it not only holds its own, but improves on the formula in several key respects, from a politically engaged villain to an emotionally grounded final showdown."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"Like Taika Waititi before him, Ryan Coogler gives the Marvel template a bold auteurist twist with an African extravaganza that packs a muscular intensity and challenges as much as it exhilarates."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"Coogler (Fruitvale Station, Creed) has fashioned a slightly more earnest variation on the typical MCU movie — one that is still fun and funny, but also rooted in a desire to speak meaningfully about racism, global culture clashes, and the tension between hiding behind one’s borders and helping outsiders in need."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"The actors are all seen to very good advantage. Boseman certainly holds his own, but there are quite a few charismatic supporting players here keen to steal every scene they can — and they do, notably the physically imposing Jordan, the radiant Nyong'o and especially Wright, who gives her every scene extra punch and humor."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"While many Marvel films, even some of the good ones, feel like small pieces of a larger story, Black Panther is an entire cinematic universe unto itself."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"The intriguing thing about Black Panther is that it doesn’t look like a superhero film – more a wide-eyed fantasy romance: exciting, subversive and funny."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"As with Jordan Peele’s Get Out, or Coogler’s 2015 Rocky spin-off Creed, Black Panther isn’t a novelty, but a fresh perspective on a well-worn format. Not to get all Rosa Parks about it, but the film walks into the multiplex like it’s insane that it hasn’t been allowed in there all along. And it is."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,75,"Black Panther fights constantly and bitterly against the familiar constraints of Disney's superhero industrial complex. At every turn, the expectations of the genre, the bland sameness that breeds cinematic comfort for the millions who line up to fill Marvel's coffers, are met by the director with resistance and creative intensity."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,75,"Chadwick Boseman commands every moment of this film, radiating probity and purpose, and it’s only later on that you realize that, with another actor, this wouldn’t have been a sure thing. The Black Panther is a superhero with lots of uncertainty."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,75,"Michel B. Jordan plays Erik Killmonger with such moving, occasionally gut-wrenching commitment that it nearly mitigates the goofiness of his moniker and the superficiality of the film in toto."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,63,"Whatever its cultural significance, it’s just passable entertainment, a noble attempt at waxing mythical that never, for one second, delivers that out-of-body giddiness that makes popcorn pictures of its ilk burst to life."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,100,"The Avengers latest stand feels well worth the wait. It’s not perfect, but it goes to a place most tentpole movies wouldn’t dream of, while retaining the scale, excitement, and humour you’ve come to demand from an MCU movie."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,100,"Marvel has solved their third-act problem and villain problem and then some. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. But then, neither are our heroes."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,93,"Avengers: Infinity War is epic in a way that has been often aspired to but never fully grasped when it comes to the translation from comic book panel to the Big Screen. It’s what happens when moviemakers take their source material seriously, eschewing unnecessary melodrama even as they fully embrace the grandeur, the sheer spectacle, of it all."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,91,"After years of movies where even the most mediocre heroes appeared to be invulnerable and indomitable, it’s an arresting jolt — and exactly the film the franchise needed."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,90,"The film boasts plenty of comic-book action while also making room for a darker tone and emotional resonance rarely matched in previous installments. In a cinematic world stuffed with big-budget movies, Infinity War is a genuine blockbuster."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,90,"Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain to set the stakes higher than ever, Avengers: Infinity War successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,89,"Never has the “Marvel Cinematic Universe” seemed like more of a universe, in ways both good and bad. Infinity War—the title is almost too apt—is a narrative juggling act the likes of which I’m not sure I’ve ever seen before. It is far from a perfect movie, but it is probably close to the best movie it could have been."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,89,"The Marvel films have been accused of being repetitive in their structure; Infinity War bursts any conventions wide apart. This is a vast, truly epic endeavor, one that both brings the current MCU to a near-climax (wait for the so-far-untitled follow-up, due May 2019, for the ultimate resolution), and sets the future in motion."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,88,"No, it’s not a game-changer like ""Deadpool"" or ""Logan."" It remains firmly anchored within the “traditional” comic book milieu. But, with an unwavering devotion to spectacle and action, the film throws down a gauntlet where this kind of mass team-up is concerned."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,88,"Infinity War might be the biggest and most ambitious Marvel movie yet, but it’s certainly not the best. (I’d put it somewhere in the bottom half of the Top 10.) However, there’s plenty of action, humor and heart — and some genuinely effective dramatic moments in which familiar and beloved characters experience real, seemingly irreversible losses."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,88,"It could have been an unholy mess, but with directors Anthony and Joe Russo at the helm, Infinity War is instead a glorious, multilayered and clever comic-book adventure with loads of emotional stakes and a perfect foe for Earth’s mightiest heroes."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,83,"Ultimately, the latest Marvel event is ‘Civil War’ on steroids and as enormous a spectacle as you’ll ever see on the screen that’ll leave you shook. For a movie plot this thin and basic, ‘Infinity War,’ is remarkably gripping, supersized entertainment that should exhilarate audiences, electrify the box office and continue the Marvel hegemony for years to come."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,80,"With so many ingredients to stir into this overflowing pot, you have to hand it to the two experienced teams of Marvel collaborators who had a feel for how to pull this magnum opus off."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,80,It’s a sleekly witty action opera that’s at once overstuffed and bedazzling.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,80,"The script is surprisingly smart, pulling together all the subplots and cutting among all the locations. Chris Pratt’s Star Lord has some clever lines. Thanos is a far more complex villain than we usually get. And the movie ends on a stark and shocking note."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,80,"Somehow in its pure uproariousness, it works. It’s just a supremely watchable film, utterly confident in its self-created malleable mythology. And confident also in the note of apocalyptic darkness."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"A comic-book flick that’s as thrilling and enthralling as it is pretentious and preposterous. The story is just an excuse for the action sequences, and the Marvel strategy remains intact: When in doubt, blow stuff up."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"It’s exhausting, but it’s also frequently effective. It’s surface-level with its emotional beats, but a number of them still land, largely thanks to the continuously all-in performances of the series’ endlessly patient stars. It’s an event that advertises itself as an event in every way, while somehow still managing to justify the immense hype around it."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"It’s filled with moments that click, but it just feels too big."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,All the past decade’s Marvel movies have been heading toward this showdown. Turns out the payoff was worth the wait.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"There are moments of high drama in Infinity War—between father and daughter, brother and brother, mentor and protégé, lover and lover—that these actors, as deep in this series as we are, deliver on with teary intensity. And there’s a haunting final sequence that is as grave and, I daresay, almost poetic as anything the film series has done."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"Infinity War is big, blustery and brave, taking viewers to places that they may not be used to going."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,What saves Infinity War from being just another bloated supergroup tour – and what will end up being the thing that blows fans’ minds to dust – is the film’s final stretch.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"As a virtuoso juggling act, Infinity War has no real parallel in popular culture; as a movie, it’s an impressive montage of greatest hits until the gut punch of a finale."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"Avengers: Infinity War leaves viewers up in the air, feeling exhilarated and cheated at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes ... at least not yet."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"So, for basically 90 percent of this movie, I’m sitting there thinking, Okay, this is awesome. Then things changed slightly. And I need to be clear: not to the point it changes how I feel about the movie. I still enjoyed it immensely. But Infinity War did send me out on an unfulfilled note, which, to be fair, is probably by design"
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"Flagrantly, bombastically extravagant, it plays its audience like a hundred million fiddles."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"Whatever else it may be — a culmination, an obligation, a staggering feat of crowd control, a truly epic tease — Avengers: Infinity War is a brisk, propulsive, occasionally rousing and borderline-gutsy continuation of a saga that finally and sensibly seems to be drawing to a close."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,The Russos and the hundreds of craftspeople who worked on this film have dreamed up marvelous battles — especially the one where a motley assortment of heroes take their cracks at the purportedly unstoppable Thanos. But only once here did an intergalactic vista catch my breath the way a splash page in a Silver Surfer comic might.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"Infinity War boasts the most breathtaking, audacious moment in superhero movie history, one that rocketed through my brain and tore apart everything I thought I knew about the past 10 years of Marvel moviemaking. For the first time in a while, I can’t wait to see what happens next."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"Avengers: Infinity War cares a bit too much about being ""Part 1"" and holding enough development for ""Part 2,"" but MCU fans should see their 10-year buildup expectations met - not exceeded, but met."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"Directors Joe and Anthony Russo move their many playing pieces around with as much grace as possible, and they offer up jolts of pleasure throughout."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,67,"Some of the sequences are undeniably thrilling but, at about 2-1/2 hours, overkill sets in early."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,67,"This story may be on its last legs, but as table-setting for an even bigger threat, Infinity War daringly leaves more questions in the air. The way this world ends looks to be not with a bang, but a whimper."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,63,"Picking up where Joss Whedon, director of the first two “Avengers” films, left off, sibling filmmakers Anthony and Joe Russo have so many pairings and sparrings to work through that the movie is essentially a mixed martial arts extravaganza with a severely overcrowded undercard."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,63,"Characters overflow on the screen, crowding out emotional investment, and there is a severely misplaced emphasis on the power of special effects — many characters appear to be entirely digitized, and none has much screen impact."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,63,"This movie shouldn't just engage and amuse and occasionally move us; it should shock and scar us. It should kill Ned Stark and Optimus Prime and Bambi's mommy, then look us in the eye after each fresh wound and say, ""Sorry, love. These things happen."""
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,63,It’s really the simple pleasure of seeing so many good actors together that makes “Infinity War” — an “Ocean’s Eleven” in hyper drive — work.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,60,"Organisationally, the movie has a struggle on its hands not to seem like the contents of a toy chest simply chucked down the stairs, with all the chaos of limbs and accessories that implies."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,60,"Thanos is the most interesting, and most complex, character here."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,60,"It’s hard to give sibling co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo (makers of the thornier Captain America films) any credit—or blame, really—for steering a product that’s been so corporately fine-tuned. They toggle dutifully between million-dollar quips and Wrestlemania smackdowns, and when they find room for a vista of galactic stillness, it’s not out of any inspired vision so much as the need for air."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,60,"I appreciate the sheer logistical achievement of Infinity War (and the chutzpah of its ending). I laughed a bunch of times, and some of the scenes are definitely exciting. But I would be lying if I pretended this movie ever grabbed me the way the best MCU movies did."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,58,"Infinity War inherits plenty of the problems endemic to crossovers: the privileging of quantity over quality, of spectacle over story, and of the shock value of major changes to the status quo over just about everything else."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"The plot consists of bits: a fiery slugfest, a pause for bonding, a quick weep, and a patch of jokey repartee, before the slugging returns. Acts of sacrifice are dotted throughout, and we are urged to applaud the burgeoning fellowship of those who unite against Thanos, but, in truth, it’s every man for himself."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"As for everything that happens this time around, it’s a function — or malfunction — of the sequel’s two-part structure. The problem is penultimateness, too much setup and too little payoff. The solution comes, presumably, around the same time next year."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"Over the last few years, the Avengers, together and separately, have spawned a number of good, very good, or reasonably entertaining movies. But with Avengers: Infinity War, the Marvel Comics franchise arrives at the stage of decadence. There’s just too much of it. A victim of its own success, there are just too many appealing characters here to stuff into one story."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"The film has its momentary diversions, a few good throwaway jokes amid a tremendous amount of PG-13 maiming and destruction."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"Ordinary rules of drama don’t apply in the Marvel Universe, so expecting Avengers: Infinity War to build suspense, reach a climax and deliver some sort of conclusion is just…unreasonable."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"Where you end up may not be where you thought this was going. The final act, including the post-credits sting (to infinity and beyond, as it were) brings a chill, a darkness and a hush that represent something new in this universe."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,Infinity War is all manic monotony. It's passably numbing in the moment. And despite the hard-luck finish—something an obligatory post-credits sequence goes a long way toward neutering—it's instantly forgettable.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,40,Sitting through its 2 hours and 30 minutes is like gorging on tapas: You wind up both overstuffed and unsatisfied.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,40,"There’s no pacing in Avengers: Infinity War. It’s all sensation and no pulse. Everything is big, all of the time."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,38,"Even by Marvel’s own standards of serviceable mediocrity, Infinity War fails."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,88,"Jurassic World is pure, dumb, wall-to-wall fun. When they hand you your 3-D glasses, you can check your brain at the door and pick it up on your way out."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,83,"Trevorrow hits all the right, respectful beats, as a protege should; you can sense a desire to please his mentor, with several amusing references to Spielberg's 1993 original, and a climactic, triumphant nod to another of his works."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,83,"Jurassic World is a blockbuster of its moment. It’s not deep. There aren’t new lessons to be learned. And the film’s flesh-and-blood actors are basically glamorized extras. But when it comes to serving up a smorgasbord of bloody dino mayhem, it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do beautifully."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,83,"Jurassic World takes the sensibilities of Steven Spielberg’s “Jurassic Park,” the sense of wonder, the awe, the thrills, and transports them into the 21st century with ease, plausibility and storytelling clarity."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,80,"Whatever else you say about Jurassic World, its amazing special effects — not just hurtling dinosaurs but flying killer pterodactyls — make it one of the most rousing people-running-away-from-stuff movies ever made. At its best, it’s good enough to take your mind off its worst, which is saying a lot."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,80,"From Pteranodon's dive-fishing to Raptors pack-hunting, Jurassic World is in its element when it's using its assets, and though they can't recreate that awe of twenty-two years ago, this is finally a sequel worthy of the title."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,80,"Jurassic World is fresh and thrilling, and while it often tips its hat to the original, it’s not a slavish copy, introducing more than enough new wrinkles into the prehistoric playbook to launch a new wave of sequels."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,80,"A terrifically enjoyable and exciting summer spectacular: savvy, funny, ridiculous in just the right way, with some smart imaginative twists."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,80,"Jurassic World is a fiendishly crafted blockbuster: old-fashioned thrills, heroism and romance, locked inside a smart, self-aware shell."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,80,"Two decades after dinosaurs ruled the Earth’s cinemas, are we still capable of putting our phones away for two hours and being honestly amazed by them, without a glaze of cynicism or irony to keep us stuck? Trevorrow, his cast and crew would clearly like to think so. And in light of their efforts, you’d have to grinningly agree."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,75,"Jurassic World, like its genomed nemesis, is bigger, and it is pretty scary. But it's not nearly as cool, or as smart, as ""Jurassic Park."""
Jurassic World,7,652270625,75,"But even without world-class smarts or amusing mutations, the next generation of “Jurassic” is an enjoyable ride."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,75,Jurassic World gives us enough dino-mite action to stave off excitement extinction.
Jurassic World,7,652270625,75,"Jurassic World is an intelligent action movie that’s saying something simple but true: Yes, people are that stupid."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,75,"Despite having a slim resume (the quirky indie Safety Not Guaranteed), Trevorrow handles Jurassic World like a pro. He hits all the right notes, giving the two-dimensional characters as much heft as they deserve (which isn't much) and handling the action sequences like a seasoned veteran of Hollywood tent pole features."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,75,"None of this is ever quite as great as it is in Spielberg’s work, but it’s reasonably close; the worst you can say about the movie is that it sticks to a highly potent formula."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,75,"Trevorrow seems to be genuinely enjoying what he's doing, and it's that sense of someone having fun behind the camera that ultimately won me over."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,75,"This state-of-the-art dino epic is also more than a blast of rumbling, roaring, ""did you effing see that!"" fun. It's got a wicked streak of subversive attitude that goes by the name of Colin Trevorrow."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,75,"It's possible to filter out the irritating aspects and enjoy the movie as a raucous, often brilliantly assembled spectacle. But we shouldn't have to. The fact that we do makes an otherwise hugely impressive sequel feel small-minded."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,70,The action sequences succeed in transporting one out of the theater and into a landscape of savagery and survival.
Jurassic World,7,652270625,70,"A whomping good time, if you don’t — and who has time to think when there’s a genetically engineered megadinosaur on the loose?"
Jurassic World,7,652270625,70,"Despite the best efforts of director Colin Trevorrow, Jurassic World's story of Indominus rex on the loose, while certainly acceptable, doesn't have the same impact as the initial film."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,70,"Jurassic World is pretty good fun. Especially for a here-today, gone-tomorrow summer blockbuster, the picture is better-crafted than it needs to be: If you ignore some extraneous plot threads, and the stop-the-presses revelation that, in the end, “what really matters is family,” Jurassic World hangs together surprisingly well."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,67,"Trevorrow and his co-screenwriters (Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and Derek Connolly) do bring some nice low-key touches to the thudfest, and action is satisfying, if not galvanizing."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,67,"Jurassic World, a goofy and fitfully entertaining summer movie, understands and even winks at its place in the pecking order of blockbuster sequels."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,63,"Jurassic World never breaks out of its own confines of homage and imitation. The movie ends up as an awkward, ungainly hybrid: large, but inconsequential."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,63,"Jurassic World is a roadworthy retread, a summer blockbuster that has more than its share of absurdities and bald patches but gets by anyway because dinosaurs."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,63,"Bailed out by a few good jolts, Jurassic World gets by, barely, as a marauding-dinosaurs narrative designed for a more jaded audience than the one ""Jurassic Park"" conquered back in 1993."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,60,"Jurassic World unquestionably “delivers.” It feels like a hit; it offers a professionally crafted blend of blandness, predictability, watered-down cultural commentary and manufactured excitement."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,60,"A bronto-sized slice of big-screen entertainment buoyed by dazzling visual effects and intense action, and a film that plays like part adventure movie, part monster movie and part thrill ride."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,60,"It’s fun, but it’s ultimately more of the same in brand-new packaging."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,60,"Intensely self-conscious of its status as a cultural commodity even as it devotedly follows the requisite playbook for mass-audience blockbuster fare, Jurassic World can reasonably lay claim to the number two position among the four series entries, as it goes down quite a bit easier than the previous two sequels."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,60,"For much of its running time, Jurassic World plays like a great theme park ride. In an age of blockbusters that lumber like herbivores, it’s refreshing to see a movie as lean and mean as a velociraptor."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,60,"While slickly enjoyable in parts, the biggest misstep here comes by puncturing Spielberg’s grandeur."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,58,"Trevorrow, like so many directors given the responsibility of delivering a straightforward blockbuster designed to satisfy bottom-line expectations, struggles to find the balance between silly and serious."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,52,"Jurassic World never works all that hard to wow us, either with groundbreaking effects or with a story that remotely holds our attention."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,50,"It’s all in good fun, and critic-proof to boot, but Jurassic World doesn’t even come close to that most intimate and dearly coveted “Gosh, wow” sense-of-wonder that the original film mustered so easily. Roar more, bite less."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,50,"What’s missing from director Colin “Safety Not Guaranteed” Trevorrow’s thriller is that “wow factor” that Spielberg’s first outing delivered. Lacking that, and any serious effort at rethinking the story formula, Jurassic World plays like a theme park ride that’s a decade out of date."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,50,"The most enjoyable moments of an otherwise oddly joyless film actually belong to Jake Johnson and Lauren Lapkus, who steal the show in an especially amusing scene during a panicked evacuation."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,50,"Every third person on the planet will go to see this movie, and they will find exactly what they seek, nothing more but certainly nothing less. It's that nothing more part that ultimately disappoints."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,50,"The team of four writers supplies one surprise, and you’ll wait 90 minutes to see it. Before and afterward, stereotypical genre characters get trotted out."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,50,"It’s fun enough while it lasts, but somehow, finally, all too much and not enough. The problem isn’t that dinosaurs have ceased to impress us, but that dinosaurs alone are not enough to sustain us"
Jurassic World,7,652270625,50,"Jurassic World can't tell whether it wants to be junk food or not, lovingly poking fun at some Hollywood tropes while shamelessly indulging others."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,42,"It turns out bigger is not better. Bigger is louder, you bet your pounding eardrums it is, but it's not smarter. More teeth aren't sharper. They're dull, and so is Jurassic World."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,40,Dull for the first hour and beefy with basic thrills for most of the second.
Jurassic World,7,652270625,40,While Jurassic World boasts a few efficient sequences...mostly it’s a grim affair that’s not leavened by adequate humour or a palpable romantic spark between Pratt and Howard.
Jurassic World,7,652270625,30,"There’s more flab than muscle packed on this galumphing franchise reboot, which, as it lumbers from scene to scene, reminds you of what a great action god Steven Spielberg is. Too bad he didn’t take the reins on this."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,25,"Jurassic World gives you exactly what Howard’s character promises at the beginning — More! Bigger! Faster! — but you know there’s something deeply wrong with a film that expects you to shed tears over digitally created prehistoric creatures and rubber brontosaurus heads instead of rooting for, you know, people."
Jurassic World,7,652270625,20,Mr. Pratt’s charm is no match for the crude filmmaking or the stupid plot that keeps him running around in a constant state of artificial animation.
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,100,"There are moments of genuine pathos, genuine humor, genuine surprise. As much as the film adheres to the strictures of the standard comic-book movie, it also pops with a knowing, loving, Whedon-world jokiness that keeps everything barreling along."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,100,The Avengers is both campy and ­reverential. Comic-Con nerds will have multiple orgasms. I had a blast.
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,100,"Most impressive of all, The Avengers makes superhero movies new again - a colossal task indeed."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,91,"Tasked with meeting the many requirements necessary for any Avengers movie to work, Whedon checks off all the boxes, then sets about creating new expectations for what a big superhero movie ought to be."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,90,"The real hero here is Joss Whedon, who directs the film with a fanboy's enthusiasm and a thorough knowledge of the genre."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,88,The Avengers kicks ass.
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,88,"The Avengers has it all. And then some. Six superheroes for the price of one ticket... It's also the blockbuster I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one, shiny, stupendously exciting package. It's ""Transformers"" with a brain, a heart and working sense of humor. Suck on that, Michael Bay. [10 May 2012, p.74]"
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,83,"The Avengers is as brawny and lamebrainy as any comic book movie deserves to be, capped by a 40-minute assault pummeling senses as few action sequences ever have."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,83,"In terms of storytelling, The Avengers is for the most part a highly functional, banged-together vehicle that runs on synthetic franchise fuel. Yet the grand finale of CGI action, set in the streets of New York, is - in every sense - smashing."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,80,"This mania is what Marvel followers have hungered for, and it would be fruitless to deny their delight. As Loki says to a crowd of earthlings, ""It is the unspoken truth of humanity that you crave subjugation."" We do, Master, we do."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,80,"Whedon is the key reason why this $220-million behemoth of a movie is smartly thought out and executed with verve and precision. It may be overly long at two hours, 23 minutes, but so much is going on you might not even notice."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,80,The action scenes-blissfully easy to follow-are where Whedon makes the giant leap into the big leagues.
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,80,"The Avengers doesn't aim for transcendence, only for the juggler's skill of keeping the balls smoothly airborne, and in 3-D too (converted after production). At that it succeeds."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,80,"The Avengers have been assembled and, for the most part, they fit together superbly. A joyous blend of heroism and humour that raises the stakes even as it maintains a firm grip on what makes the individual heroes tick."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,80,"Big, brash and very funny, Joss Whedon's Avengers Assemble is equal to the sum of its parts – and for once, that's no faint praise. Suit up."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,80,"Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,80,"Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,78,"Fans of all that has come before (excluding Roger Corman's premature-ejaculation version of ""The Fantastic Four,"" natch) will weep tears of giddy joy at how crowd-pleasingly cohesive – and ridiculously fun – this film is."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,"The banter has zip, the effects are fun, the climactic battle is decently spectacular, and if the 3-D is mostly expendable, there are a few scenes where it adds a nice kick."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,"Even with the flaws of the final half, The Avengers is grand, brisk fun.  It comes tantalizingly close to reaching the level of the very best comic book films of the current generation."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,The film is good enough to keep all the Marvel Comics crazed audiences out there deliriously happy while keeping the rest of us earthbound types in moderate thralldom.
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,"The Avengers has been executed with all the reverence the super-fans demand, as well as the winking, self-referential humor that has made it palatable for filmgoers disinclined to take a bunch of grown men dressed in spangles and spandex so very seriously."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,Whedon has made a superb template of an action film.
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,"Whedon weaves a story that allows each of the heroes to do what they do best. And while they may not have exactly equal time, audiences get enough of each to feel satisfied, but not sated. Clever work, indeed."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,"When I see these six together, I can't help thinking of the champions at the Westminster Dog Show. You have breeds that seem completely different from one another (Labradors, poodles, boxers, Dalmatians), and yet they're all champions."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,"You don't need to be a ""comic-book person"" to find the set pieces exhilarating. But if you are such a person, or a fan of the movies that comic books turn into, The Avengers feels like the moment you've been waiting for."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,"If the film is more solid and satisfying than terrific, so be it."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,"The Avengers is neither overwhelming nor underwhelming. What it expertly is, is whelming."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,70,"Because it pulls off the tricky feat of combining multiple pre-existing Marvel franchises into a reasonably entertaining and tonally coherent whole, The Avengers will likely be hailed as a kind of thinking fan's superhero film, the way Whedon's recent ""Cabin in the Woods"" functioned as both a horror movie and a critique of same."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,63,"The fiery finale is good enough to leave the legions smiling. But when a movie is expected to lift an entire industry, ""good enough"" shouldn't be good enough."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,63,"The chaos and carnage here is just a pumped-up take on a tradition that harks back to Godzilla, and harks back, of course, to the Marvel comics from which all these heros originally sprang."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,63,"While The Avengers exhibits exemplary craftsmanship, Joss Whedon hasn't made a great film."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,60,"They're fascinating characters, to be sure, with back stories ripe for development. But Whedon doesn't commit here, and the results are shrug-worthy."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,60,The picture is broken down into narrative chunks that ultimately don't tell much of a story – what you get instead is a series of mini-climaxes held together by banter between characters.
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,60,"It's fun to watch Whedon pitch his heroes against each other. Child's play, maybe, but entertaining all the same."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,60,"The bad news is that if you haven't seen ""Thor,"" ""Captain America"" and ""Iron Man 2"" - that's six hours and three minutes of homework - The Avengers won't make sense. The good news is if you're a human under the age of 45, you probably already have."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,50,"Expected too is the result: a kind of sterile opulence or, if you prefer, a magnificent emptiness."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,50,"Every time the movie hints at something rich and evocative, Whedon undercuts it with a punchline - his instincts as a big-picture storyteller crippled by his short-term need to please the crowd."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,50,"The Avengers has a knockout final 30 minutes, all gee-whiz crash and bang and eye candy that makes grand use of 3D and IMAX and all the other toys. But the Transformers movies did that, too."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,40,"A slow start, a single star performance surrounded by indifferent acting and an onslaught of computer effects that range from seen-it-all-in-""Transformers"" to a whole sky full of spectacular stuff in the midtown Manhattan climax."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,40,"The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,40,"What I see in The Avengers, unfortunately, is a diminished film despite its huge scale, and kind of a bore."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,30,"Of the star-studded cast, only Mark Ruffalo (playing Bruce Banner) and Robert Downey Jr. (as Iron Man) bring any personality to the place-holder dialogue. Overlong, monotonous, violent, and simple-minded, this is like one of those ""World's Biggest Gang Bang"" videos, except that no one onscreen appears to be enjoying himself."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Rian Johnson’s film is the real deal, a bold, risky venture unafraid to tell its own story, freed from the weight of nostalgia and formula."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"While there are some solid nuggets of deep-cut easter eggs for hardcore fans, what is so extraordinary about The Last Jedi is that this is the first post-Lucas Star Wars film that feels free to dance to its own beat."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"It’s not a perfect movie, but it may be a great one."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Like many before it, The Last Jedi has already been hailed as the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back, and while that’s true, it’s too faint a compliment. It’s a film of genuine beauty, one where you come away as eager to talk about the set design and the choreography as you do the fate of the galaxy or what might happen next."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi launches the franchise to another level of action and humor thanks to incoming writer-director Rian Johnson, whose imagination seems boundless as George Lucas’ 40 years ago."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"An excellent middle chapter bursting with wit, wisdom, emotion, shocks, old-fashioned derring-do, state-of-the-art tech, and stonking set-pieces."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Easily its most exciting iteration in decades — the first flat-out terrific “Star Wars” movie since 1980’s “The Empire Strikes Back.” It seizes upon Lucas’ original dream of finding a pop vessel for his obsessions — Akira Kurosawa epics, John Ford westerns, science-fiction serials — and fulfills it with a verve and imagination all its own."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Sure, it’s just a space Western, but “Star Wars” is one of the our most popular modern mythologies. Johnson respects that. He’s infused the storyline with new energy and artistry, and I can’t wait to see it again."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Writer/director Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a sprawling, incident- and character-packed extravaganza that picks up at the end of “Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens” and guides the series into unfamiliar territory. It’s everything a fan could want from a “Star Wars” film and then some."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"A triumph of comic irreverence and dramatic purpose, Episode VIII dazzles like the sci-fi saga hasn't in decades."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,It’s less Star Wars as you’ve never seen it than Star Wars as you’ve never felt it.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,97,Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the quintessential Star Wars movie. It embraces everything in the franchise that came before while taking big risks to push the story into new and unexpected places.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,93,"The movie is smart, stirring and deeply exciting, but more than anything, it is surprising. This is a Star Wars movie that plays with your assumptions and upends them, but it never betrays the story, characters and ethos at the series’ core. It expands the idea of what a Star Wars movie can be. It’ll knock you over."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,91,"Under the fastidious guidance of writer-director Johnson, The Last Jedi turns the commercial restrictions of this behemoth into a Trojan horse for rapid-fire filmmaking trickery and narrative finesse. The result is the most satisfying entry in this bumpy franchise since “The Empire Strikes Back” in 1980."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"No matter how much money has been poured into a movie, it’s emotional generosity that matters, and Johnson gives without squandering. His great gift is that he knows when to stop."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"The new Star Wars, Episode VIII: The Last Jedi is shockingly good."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"What’s important in The Last Jedi is what happens to, and what we find out about, all of these characters along the way. In retrospect, The Force Awakens feels like a short introduction to these characters. After The Last Jedi, I feel like I’ve gone on a week-long road trip with them all."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"Yes, the latest “Star Wars” installment is here, and, lo, it is a satisfying, at times transporting entertainment. Remarkably, it has visual wit and a human touch, no small achievement for a seemingly indestructible machine that revved up 40 years ago and shows no signs of sputtering out (ever)."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is striking, stunning, visually hypnotizing, thrilling - everything ""epic"" about the famed franchise rolled into a tremendously overcharged start to Rian Johnson's Star Wars career."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"The Force is, to me, still silly Star Wars mumbo jumbo, but Johnson finds a way to underscore it with humanity, with a classical Greek rumble of true pathos. On that front, The Last Jedi is a pure success, accessing the molten core of its drama and grappling with it in nuanced ways."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"Writer-director Rian Johnson has certainly made the busiest Star Wars film of them all, but he keeps it from becoming a slog by infusing it with humor, verve, and visual charm."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"The space battles and lightsaber duels are appropriately exciting, but Johnson keeps a close eye on the human element that girds this galactic odyssey. Rather than simply regurgitating Star Wars’ past, The Last Jedi emphatically builds on it."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"The new movie truly passes the torch by making the next generation of Resistance heroes — Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and new addition, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) — every bit as compelling as the old guard. Even more surprising, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) evolves from the whiny brat in “The Force Awakens” to a three-dimensional menace."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"There are images in this movie that provoke awe and delight, and creatures that feel lifted out of half-remembered childhood dreams. And though it briefly appears to lose steam in the middle, that’s short-lived, with a third act harboring sequences that feel like a maestro conducting a concerto the size of the cosmos."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,89,"While Abrams peddled name recognition, Johnson understands that the classic characters have to reignite the torch before they can pass it on, and gives both Leia and Luke defining moments."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi has more than enough action, humor and stuff blowing up to thoroughly satisfy fans of the long-running franchise."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"The Star Wars universe is the best toy box a fanboy could ever wish for, and Johnson makes sure that Jedi is bursting at the seams with knockout fun surprises, marvelous adventure and shocking revelations that will leave your head spinning."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,Last Jedi is deep. It’s also rollicking. It’s right up there with the very first “Star Wars” in terms of its enjoyability factor. It’s a triumph.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"Much will be resolved by the final chapter of the trilogy, to be directed by Abrams. As much as I enjoy his brand of canny populism, I prefer Rian Johnson’s wilder, generous, far-flung imagination."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"The Last Jedi tries to do a little too much in its overlong 2½ hours, yet writer/director Rian Johnson still turns in a stellar entry that owes much to George Lucas’ original films while finding a signature vibe of its own and unleashing a few welcome twists."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"Huge, important things happen to characters secondary and primary. Surprises big and small abound. As is the case with all of the “Star Wars” films, where there is evil there is heroism, and where there is bravery there is sacrifice — and sometimes where there is love, there is heartbreak."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"If having pure fun at a “Star Wars” movie is wrong, I don’t want to be right. So for me, The Last Jedi falls right behind “The Empire Strikes Back” and maybe the original film in providing the thrills and the heartbreak, the heroism and villainy, and the romance and betrayal that makes these films such a treat even for those of us who can’t name all the planets or the alien species or even the Empire’s flunkies."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,83,"By the rousing final act, Johnson has brought an apocalyptic grandeur to the lightsaber duels and airborne combat. His often-stirring addition to the saga finally lands on an affecting point about the importance of preserving essential cultural tradition without clinging too strictly to the dogma—and the texts—of the old way."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,83,The film simply drags too much in the middle. Somewhere in the film’s 152-minute running time is an amazing 90-minute movie.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,83,"Audiences will likely come away from The Last Jedi with a lot of complaints and questions. But they’re at least likely to feel they’re in the hands of someone who cares about the series as much as they do, someone who loves its history, but sees the wide-open future ahead of it as well."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,83,Rian Johnson’s main feat is being savvy enough to know that sometimes the best thing to do is cherishing the past before burning it to the ground.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,83,"“Star Wars” has always been about destiny, fate, and legacy. However, perhaps like no film in the franchise yet, The Last Jedi seriously considers the hubris that comes with certainty, and how knots from the past that can keep you bound from moving forward."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,80,"The Last Jedi checks off all the boxes you want from a Star Wars movie, including one of the coolest lightsaber fights in the series’ 40 years, but Johnson is also interested in exploring new territory, including a consideration of the shadings and nuances to the Light and Dark Sides of the Force."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,80,"If The Force Awakens raised a lot of questions, The Last Jedi tackles them head-on, delivering answers that will shock and awe in equal measure. Fun, funny but with emotional heft, this is a mouth-watering set-up for Episode IX and a fitting tribute to Carrie Fisher."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,80,The Last Jedi gives you an explosive sugar rush of spectacle. It’s a film that buzzes with belief in itself and its own mythic universe – a euphoric certainty that I think no other movie franchise has. And there is no provisional hesitation or energy dip of the sort that might have been expected between episodes seven and nine.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"By breaking down some of the old mythology, Johnson has staked out new territory. For the first time in a long time, a “Star Wars” film feels forward-moving."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the eighth movie in the series and one of the better ones. I’d rank it behind “The Empire Strikes Back” (still by far the best) and the first film, but it’s about on par with the enjoyable last episode, “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” which also awakened the long-moribund franchise."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"The Last Jedi is a film of moments. There are perhaps a half-dozen of them: goose-pimple inducing, fist-pump encouraging, heart-racing bursts of cinematic satisfaction. The problem is that the narrative threads connecting them are lazily knitted and sometimes tangled or broken."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi unspools like a one-movie binge watch, a lively if overlong and busily plotted second chapter to the latest Star Wars trilogy that advances the story and deepens its characters with a combination of irreverent humor and worshipful love for the original text."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"You don’t see many sci-fi action extravaganzas that are about late middle-aged disappointment, about wondering what it’s all about and whether any of it was worth it. It’s this element that gives The Last Jedi an extra something, a fascinating melancholy undercurrent."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"These sequels trade directly on the emotional legacy of the originals (The Last Jedi makes some leaps into sentimental hyperspace, particularly in the way that it handles Fisher on-screen), and the more of the aged Luke and Leia we see, the more we chip away at the mythic power of characters as Lucas left them: Young, strong, immortal."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"For all its strengths, The Last Jedi is a very manic film, fueled by excellent ideas that could have been parsed out in smarter ways."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,70,"Does the movie, like its predecessor, rely on familiar tropes a bit more than it should? Yes, I think it does. Is it, at a solid two-and-a-half hours, considerably longer than it needed to be? Yes, that too. But it’s still a pretty damn good movie, arguably the best the franchise has offered since Empire."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,70,"While Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a good movie and a worthy entry, it would have been stronger if Johnson didn’t telegraph those new directions before leading us to them."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,70,"A narrative that mixes, not always successfully, stirring moments and sensational action with angst and grim conflictedness on a galactic scale."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,70,"Although The Last Jedi meets a relatively high standard for franchise filmmaking, Johnson’s effort is ultimately a disappointment. If anything, it demonstrates just how effective supervising producer Kathleen Kennedy and the forces that oversee this now Disney-owned property are at molding their individual directors’ visions into supporting a unified corporate aesthetic."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,70,"Loaded with action and satisfying in the ways its loyal audience wants it to be, writer-director Rian Johnson's plunge into George Lucas' universe is generally pleasing even as it sometimes strains to find useful and/or interesting things for some of its characters to do."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,63,The latest entrant in this now-Disney-owned franchise is largely content to further the themes and narrative strategies of J.J. Abrams's predecessor.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,50,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi yokes Johnson’s formidable cinematic intelligence to an elaborate feat of fan service that feels, above all, like the rhetorical and dramatic gratification of a religious sect."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,50,"Ridley, full of charming spunk playing a skeptical rebel recruit in The Force Awakens, is the biggest disappointment here. She is less engaging now that she is committed to the fight and plays most of the later action on a single note of earnest desperation; Johnson's script leaves her little else."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,50,"Intentions and inspiration aside, Last Jedi doesn’t add up to an “Empire Strikes Back” for this trilogy. There’s no romance, little pathos and no real punch-in-the-gut moment. Its emotionally sterile tone was set with “The Force Awakens,” and that’s proven hard to shake, new innovations and plot twists aside."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,100,"Rogue One might trade heavily in nostalgia but it's bold enough to take risks, and will leave you stirred, fired up and raring for more. Now, if only there was a follow-up we could go away and watch immediately…"
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,100,"It stands alone as the best ""Star Wars"" entry since 1980's ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Yes, it's that good."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,90,"Perhaps the darkest, most action-packed Star Wars instalment, director Gareth Edwards’ standalone adventure establishes its own rhythm, balancing fan demands with grand, poetic moments unlike anything this cinematic galaxy has previously achieved."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,88,Rogue One spins “Star Wars” into a whole new orbit.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,88,"Rogue One is a letdown in other areas, and there are creative decisions so ill-conceived they take you out of the story. But somehow these aren't enough to sink the movie, which manages to succeed as both super-nerdy fan service and the first entry since the 1977 original that will satisfy people who have never seen a ""Star Wars"" film."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,88,"This is a very “Star Wars”-y “Star Wars” movie. It’s not quite on the level of the original or “The Empire Strikes Back” (the best of ’em all, of course), but it’s on a par with last year’s “The Force Awakens” and it’s light years above “Attack of the Clones” and “The Phantom Menace.”"
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,88,"With the smashing Jones giving us a female warrior to rank with the great ones and a cast that knows how to keep it real even in a sci-fi fantasy, Rogue One proves itself a Star Wars story worth telling."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,83,Rogue One would have been a very good stand-alone sci-fi movie if it came out under a different name. But what makes it especially exciting is how it perfectly snaps right into the Star Wars timeline and connects events we already know by heart with ones that we never even considered.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,83,"Rogue One is a very good “Star Wars” film, frustratingly though, it falls short of being a truly great one."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,80,"The film soars when it abandons all pretense of being a space opera, and fully embraces the bombastic modern action movie that’s at its core, giving it a unique identity that does indeed stand apart from other entries in the series."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,80,"A minor miracle in and of itself, Edwards' Rogue One somehow delivers on almost all of its weighty pre-release promises whilst at the same time besting The Force Awakens for sheer spectacle and world-building."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,80,"This is an imperfect film, bold but occasionally baffling, and one that in its final act grows into something much more exciting than you might initially expect."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,80,"Rogue One stands on its own, an entry that is at once part of the “Star Wars” franchise (obviously) but also separate – a tougher, grittier film."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,80,"The ultimate Star Wars fan film, it’s short on whimsy but when it gets going there’s enough risk-taking and spectacle to bode well for future standalones."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,80,"What fans will get here is loads of action, great effects, good comic relief, stunning locations (Iceland, Jordan and the Maldives) and some intriguing early glimpses of the Galactic Empire as it begins to flex its inter-galactic power."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,80,"But in its best moments, there’s a yarn-spinning intimacy to it too – an old war story told around a spectacular campfire."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,80,This is another really entertaining fantasy with fan-fiction energy and attack.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,78,"It starts off slow and somewhat clunky, but by the time the mind-blowing third act arrives, it’s all a fan can do not to stand up and cheer."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,75,Rogue One is a better movie than The Force Awakens - something that elevates it considerably over its “secondary” designation.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,75,"By the time its credits rolled, I was ready to forgive Rogue One any imperfections. Its last 10 minutes are spectacular and dark, with a final flourish that should give any “Star Wars” fan goose bumps — and a new hope that the next main installment will be this good."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,75,"It has undeniable weaknesses: an underwritten protagonist, a generic villain, a shortage of interesting personalities. (No knock against the large cast, which is mostly very good, but underused.) But in many other respects, it is a better film than last year’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens: leaner, darker, with a distinct visual style and an actual ending that feels like a denial of blockbuster expectations simply because it shows basic narrative integrity."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,75,"The action sequences, both on the ground and in space, are rousingly staged. But the losses incurred in those sequences are sobering. The stakes in the “Star Wars” rebellion are high indeed."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,75,Rogue One will engage such diehards but making new friends for the brand is unlikely.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,75,"I do wish Felicity Jones’ character popped the way Daisy Ridley’s did in last year’s franchise offering. “The Force Awakens,” directed by J.J. Abrams, was smooth, consistent, even-toned, nostalgic. Rogue One zigzags, and it’s more willfully jarring. Yet it takes time for callbacks and shout-outs to characters we’ve seen before, and we’ll see again. And again. And again."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,75,"It’s almost wholly satisfying — witty, warm and entertaining — a film in which fatalism isn’t a joke, where pitiless death is doled out by Empire and Rebellion, where those deaths have weight and meaning, where suspense is genuine."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,70,"The movie didn’t rekindle the thrill of seeing, say, The Empire Strikes Back, but Rogue One will loom pretty large in the Star Wars galaxy — if only because there’s so little competition."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,70,"By breaking some of the rules, Rogue One has made itself the first movie since The Empire Strikes Back to redefine the boundaries of what a Star Wars movie can be. The Force Awakens may have reanimated the once-dormant franchise, but it’s Rogue One that will give Star Wars fans a new hope."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,70,"A swiftly paced, rough-and-ready entertainment that, in anticipating the canonical events of “A New Hope,” manages the tricky feat of seeming at once casually diverting and hugely consequential."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,70,Director Gareth Edwards has finally made the first “Star Wars” movie for grown-ups.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,70,Rogue One makes up for a shaky first act by punching into overdrive for an outstanding third act battle sequence that overwhelms in scale and intensity.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,65,"With all the aerial dogfights, armored combat vehicles, grenades, flame-throwers and snipers, Rogue One feels like a film for those who think that most Star Wars movies are insufficiently like World War II flicks. Or maybe that they should more closely resemble computer games."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,63,"The cast does good work, despite a less-than-great screenplay."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,63,"By no stretch is this a disaster on a par with Lucas’s misbegotten prequel trilogy. Still, at least until its final section, Rogue One lacks the zip, zing and exhilarating sense of return to form that “The Force Awakens” conveyed so lightly."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,63,"Rogue One is often undermined by its close ties to George Lucas’ original trilogy, and more emphasis is put on its central mission than its fresh-faced characters."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,63,Rogue One is less the fetish object that The Force Awakens is because it at least has the ambitions to create its own character dynamics and plot routes rather than coast on existing ones.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,60,"Edwards is very good at crafting images that straddle the uncomfortable line between beauty and horror, and at dwarfing people with giant monsters and machines with powers beyond mortal comprehension. It’s his comprehension of mortals that sometimes feels lacking."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,58,"Action is Rogue One’s strongest suit, and what makes all the faffing about bearable."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,58,"For a film that’s all about hope and rebellion, it’s kind of ironic how it’s such a conflicted mess in and of itself. The Force should have been stronger with this one."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,58,"Not only is “Rogue One” the rare modern blockbuster that could have afforded to risk something real, it’s the rare modern blockbuster that gave itself a genuine responsibility to do so. And yet, for all of its excitement and occasional splendor, there’s nothing the least bit rebellious about it. It could have been special, instead it’s just… forced."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,50,"The story hits every expected beat, right when you expect it to. And it squanders some of its best resources."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,50,"Plots and subplots are handled with clumsy expediency, and themes that might connect this movie with the larger Lucasfilm mythos aren’t allowed to develop. You’re left wanting both more and less."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,50,Rogue One is a minor little story with a likable cast and familiar Star Wars themes. But it tries so hard to be an epic masterpiece – with self-important speeches and an insanely outsize orchestral score –  that it ends up a laughable parody of itself.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,50,"Only Tudyk’s dry humour in the role of the tactless droid K-2S0 makes Edwards’s darkly reductivist approach occasionally seem smarter rather than lesser. In the end, this hardening of the franchise seems likely to alienate both the fans and the uninitiated."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,50,"Rogue One's creators clearly want to move us deeply — several major plot developments should pack an overwhelming emotional wallop — but they haven’t given this talented cast enough to work with. It’s fast, loud, even lovely — and not terribly engaging."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,50,"The good news about Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the first in a planned series of stand-alone movies set in the “Star Wars” universe, is that the last half-hour of the film is a sustained stretch of rousing action, indelible images and cliffhanger thrills. It’s pop sci-fi bliss...The bad news about Rogue One is that getting to the good stuff is a slog — and the movie is pretty long."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,50,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is for the fans, all right, but in that expression’s worst way."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,42,"Edwards and the screenwriters have designed Rogue One around applause breaks for cameos and callbacks. We’ve all lost the point of the franchise. Audiences once packed theaters to gawk at the future; now, it’s to soak in the past."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,40,"The fault lies not with Ms. Jones, an appealing performer, but with Gareth Edwards, who directed doggedly from a delight-free script by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,38,"“Star Wars” movies have been dazzling, infuriating, heartbreaking, silly, witty, convoluted, gripping and overblown. But until Rogue One: A Star Wars story, I don’t think “dull” was the most appropriate adjective."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,30,"The director of Rogue One, Gareth Edwards, has stepped into a mythopoetic stew so half-baked and overcooked, a morass of pre-instantly overanalyzed implications of such shuddering impact to the series’ fundamentalists, that he lumbers through, seemingly stunned or constrained or cautious to the vanishing point of passivity, and lets neither the characters nor the formidable cast of actors nor even the special effects, of which he has previously proved himself to be a master, come anywhere close to life."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,25,"It’s a downer. It’s morally tangled. The characters are as depressed as the scenario, and Michael Giacchino’s music can’t make it better."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,91,An astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,88,"A highly entertaining and visually breathtaking movie, capable at times of rocking and delighting you."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,88,"Not a masterpiece, but it's an example of how imagination, craftsmanship, and technological bravura can fashion superior entertainment out of something that is far from flawless."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,88,"Avoid the hype, just go enjoy the movie"
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,88,It's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,83,Let the killjoys squawk. Lucas has proved he has the Naboos to pull it off again. And again. And again.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,80,"The computer-driven effects are impressive, but the adventure is hampered by a flat screenplay, dull acting, and just a hint as to why the dark side of the Force will eventually transform cute little Anakin into the evil Darth Vader."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,80,"Despite a shaky start and the presence of questionable elements throughout, by the time it arrives at its finale -- which copies Return Of The Jedi's triple-climax structure -- The Phantom Menace has won its place alongside the original Star Wars trilogy."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,75,"Fails to recapture the elemental magic of Star Wars, and that, ironically, is because it represents the coarse culmination of the original film's adrenaline aesthetic."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,75,"It does the job just fine. That job, as director George Lucas freely admits, is quite simply to thrill the beating hearts and the inquiring minds of 12-year-old boys."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,70,"Good enough, but only just. It's got the hardware, but neither the characters, the imagination, nor the resonance one had hoped for."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,67,"In the end, Phantom needed more human and less digital scale. The magic of ""Star Wars"" lay in Lucas' ability to play the human comedy in a fantastic future. With Phantom, he has brought the series to the brink of total artificiality, the future as a video game."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,63,"It's a kiddie movie rejiggered for childish grown-ups, of whom there are enough to make it a hit. How such childishness has become a virtual secular religion is hard to imagine."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,63,Not at all bad for a toy commercial.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,63,"What I mean is that to watch The Phantom Menace as a lifelong ""Star Wars"" fan is to engage in constant, fragile negotiations between a cherished familiarity and the shock of the new."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,60,"Phantom is easily consumable eye candy, but it contains no nutrients for the heart or mind."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,60,"I warn you, I'm gonna continue whining about the movie. Just keep in mind that I liked it."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,60,"The entire film is curiously soulless, with major characters making their entrances and exits (some of which are unexpectedly final) as if they were breezing in from some other screening next door."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,60,"""Star Wars"" fans deserve better."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,60,"In special effects, Lucas has moved a galaxy beyond. In energy, not yet."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,50,"While the new film is certainly serviceable, it's noticeably lacking in warmth and humor, and though its visual strengths are real and considerable, from a dramatic point of view it's ponderous and plodding."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,50,The Empire strikes out.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,50,Story. Character. They used to mean something to George Lucas.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,50,All the state-of-the-art technology in the world is no help to an actor saddled with Lucas's tinny dialogue.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,50,It is likely to disappoint more people than creator George Lucas would have liked.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,40,George Lucas does it his way in the pallid Phantom Menace. Even cultists will wish he'd hired a director and some writers.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,40,"This ain't no movie. It's a very long, very tedious infomercial for Phantom Menace action figures, on sale now at a Target or Toys ""R"" Us near you."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,40,"The Phantom Menace is simply a billboard for itself. Anyone who sees it will be experiencing it for the second time. The hype was not about the movie, the hype was the movie."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,40,"It's difficult to discern precisely where this all went wrong, and even more difficult to speculate about possible improvements."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,88,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,88,"A whole summer of fireworks packed into one movie. It doesn't just go to 11, it starts there."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,83,"Whedon has more on his mind than he did in the last one. The Avengers seem not just contentious toward each other but weary, sick of their brutal responsibilities."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,83,"As usual, psychological anguish is a key element of Marvel heroes. Age of Ultron boasts a cast of actors that ""serious"" filmmakers would kill for, so the gravitas they're capable of conveying amid such outlandish fantasy is the franchise's stealth advantage."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,83,"This is a movie that is almost exhaustingly large-scale, and Ultron's ultimate plan involves a crazy visual idea that Whedon makes sort of beautiful and eerie. It's got so much action that I'm going to bet some audiences go numb after a while. But in scene after scene, there are beats and stunts and poses that suggest that an army of comic book fanatics worked on this movie."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"If anything, Whedon’s writing is almost too sharp. The characters are so finely drawn and verbally quick (they name-check Banksy and Eugene O’Neill) that they seem to belong to a different universe than the cartoonish one they find themselves in."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"Whedon’s handling of the personal material is what makes Age Of Ultron extraordinary. Remarkably for a film so overstuffed, no character gets neglected."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is a kinetic, wicked mix of muscle and magic. Look no further if you want a world of superpowered freaks and geeks. But be aware: It comes at a cost. Vaporized in the parade of action and characters is the wonder and simplicity of its first, superior entry."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"With Avengers: Age of Ultron, Whedon doesn't merely hit it out of the park, he Hulk-smashes it."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"It’s the interplay between the film’s many different characters, rather than the blow-up-the-world crisis they’re trying to defuse, that keeps you on the edge of your seat."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"Part horror, part love story, part morality tale, Age Of Ultron is a smart superhero smackdown that raises the bar once more."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"It’s all operatically mad, and the city-destroying final confrontation is becoming a bit familiar, but Whedon carries it off with such joy and even a kind of evangelism."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"The new movie is a sleeker, faster, funnier piece of work — the sort of sequel (like “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,” “Superman II” and “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” before it) that shrugs off the self-seriousness of its predecessor and fully embraces its inner Saturday-morning serial."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"Bigger and, yes, darker than the first, this is less air-punchingly gleeful but probably more consistent. Thanks to Whedon and the most charismatic, compelling cast you’ll find anywhere, Age of Ultron redefines the scale we can expect from our superhero epics but still fits human-sized emotion amid the bombast."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,78,"It is the product of a machine perfectly evolved for the sole purpose of annihilating boredom, a machine whose primary weakness is the utter indifference of those uninitiated or unimpressed by this point. For the rest of us, it’s a hearty helping of fine."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,75,"As I sat slavishly (and needlessly) through the entire end credit roll, it was hard to muster anything more fervent than ""Yeah, it was pretty good."" Even a clean, white hate would have somehow been more satisfying."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,75,"Age of Ultron has self-aware laughs, grandiose themes and the best effects that money can buy. But at this point, it will take true vision to plot the umpteen sequels without getting trapped in a time loop."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,75,"Whedon knows this is all nonsense, but it can be great fun, too. Age of Ultron is all rush and sensation with little substance. But what a feeling."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,75,"In its lumpy-porridge way, this film makes a better case than any other Marvel picture for the notion that quarter-billion-dollar-budgeted, CGI-festooned slabs of multimedia synergy can be art, too, provided they're made by an artist with a vision, and said artist appears to be in control of at least part of the production."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,75,"It may well be that we’ll eventually stop looking at these Marvel films as discrete, individual experiences rather than chapters in an epic binge-watch, but even by those standards, Avengers: Age of Ultron feels like a solid but overstuffed episode, one more concerned with being connective tissue than anything else."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,70,"There is much to like about Avengers: Age of Ultron. There was much to love about ""The Avengers,"" and therein lies the difference."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,70,"I enjoyed Age of Ultron more than its predecessor, despite the fact that it’s almost exactly the same thing. This was probably a result of adjusting my expectations: I wasn’t sitting there waiting for Whedon to revolutionize the genre, or to turn an overdetermined comic-book movie into a Noel Coward comedy. He delivers a clean and capable entertainment, with a handful of distinctive flourishes stuck to the margins."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,70,"Whedon and his large, capable cast (even larger for this follow-up) deliver enough adventure, laughs and flat-out spectacle to ensure that audiences will feel as if they have gotten their money’s worth, especially when Ultron zeroes in on the quiet humanity beneath the special effects."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,67,"The action sequences aren’t especially well designed, and the plot, such as it is, is essentially one catastrophe after another."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,67,"There’s so much ground to cover here—so many introductions to make, so much story to churn through, so many gargantuan set pieces to mount—that the movie never really finds room to breathe."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,67,"Still, my real beef with these movies — and this one in particular — is how same-y they’ve started to feel. Each time out, everything is at stake and nothing is at stake."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,67,"For all its bluster, end-of-doom stakes, gravitas and super-seriousness, what Whedon’s movie does best is communicate its concern for the all the human beings touched by this story: the broken, nearly shattered heroes, their extended families and even the civilians caught in the crosshairs."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,"The thing's a behemoth. And as the franchise thunders on, it's also becoming more and more a bore."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,"As he did in the first “Avengers,” writer-director Joss Whedon avoids the fatal trap of comic-book ­self-seriousness, leavening a baggy, busy, overpopulated story with zippy one-liners, quippy asides and an overarching tone of jaunty good fun."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,Age of Ultron disappoints not because it's irredeemably bad but because it fails to achieve the level of its predecessor in nearly every facet.
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,"Ultron’s goals never make much sense beyond the basic kill-the-Avengers-and-destroy-the-Earth checklist, nor does he develop as a character over the long haul. He’s just a static baddie, fun to look at and handy with a quip but ultimately as dull as unpolished chrome."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,"Entertaining as much of Avengers 2 is, especially when it's just hanging out with the gang in between scuffles (the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" lesson, learned), Whedon’s picture meets expectations without exceeding them."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,Whedon can’t quite work the same miracle twice. Age of Ultron also bears the familiar stretch marks characteristic of middle movies in franchise series.
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,"The thrill of the new, the delight in discovering how light on their feet and how trippingly the Whedon one-liners can fall off
the tongue, is fading. A bloated blockbuster movie-as-commodity like Age of Ultron doesn’t herald the end of this franchise or genre. But you can see it from here."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,"The film struggles against the rigid formula that typifies the Marvel universe, but only does so up to a point."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,"Director Joss Whedon knows how to make a wryly funny, action-packed extravaganza, as he proved with 2012's ""The Avengers."" So why did he overstuff the 2½-hour sequel?"
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"Though a mess by all conventional narrative standards, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a fascinating case study in the rules of “universe” storytelling. Chief among them is that a film may not be self-contained — it must constantly allude to worlds outside its own. Marvel fans want extra characters, extra subplots, in-jokes that pander to their supposed breadth of knowledge. They don’t want closure."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"For a Marvel agnostic like me, the single most interesting thing about Age of Ultron is that you can sense that Mr. Whedon, having helped build a universal earnings machine with the first “Avengers,” has now struggled mightily, touchingly, to invest this behemoth with some life."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"The uncomfortable reality remains that although this movie is effective moment to moment, very little of it lingers in the mind afterward. The ideal vehicle for our age of immediate sensation and instant gratification, it disappears without a trace almost as soon as it's consumed."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"Age of Ultron -- for all the eye candy and mindless entertainment it has to offer -- stays safely within the franchise's established parameters. Here, there are no real surprises."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"Age of Ultron, then, shows what happens when an unstoppable force (Joss Whedon’s imagination) meets an immovable object (the Disney/Marvel behemoth). And the result is, indeed, paradoxical: a crashy, overlong, FX-driven blockbuster that’s capable of morphing, Hulk-to-Banner style, into a loose-limbed ensemble comedy about collaboration, flirtation, and friendship."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"[Whedon] wants to give us everything, and that he fits it all in is its own kind of feat. Age of Ultron is a middling film, yet it's so heavy with his sweat that it never feels like a lazy cash-in — which for a preordained summer megahit is an accomplishment."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"Whedon has revealed that his first cut ran for well over three hours, and it shows: Ultron feels excessively nipped and tucked, barrelling from one explosive set-piece to the next, leaving ideas half-formed and character motivations murky."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"Avengers: Age of Ultron succeeds in the top priority of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do, but this time the action scenes don't always measure up and some of the characters are left in a kind of dramatic no-man's-land."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"Whereas ""The Avengers"" felt like a reimagining of the paradigm for superhero movies, Age of Ultron has air of a rerun. Though impressively made and visually remarkable, it suffers from the hollowness that plagues so many blockbusters carrying the sense that we've been through this before."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,58,"Whedon keeps approaching ideas, but every time he does so he leaves a flaming bag of dog poop on the doorstep, rings the bell and runs away tittering."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,50,"First, you try to understand what the hell is going on. Then you slowly realize that you will never understand what is going on. And, last, you wind up with the distinct impression that, if there was anything to understand, it wasn’t worth the sweat."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,50,"Supercharged and lifeless, frenetic and stone-cold dead, a barrage of action scenes that look fake, yet make you wonder if fake is the new real."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"A cinematic, cultural and personal triumph, The Dark Knight Rises is emotionally inspiring, aesthetically significant and critically important for America itself – as a mirror of both sober reflection and resilient hope."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"The conclusion of Christopher Nolan's superhero trilogy is a hugely ambitious mix of eye candy and brain food. If it doesn't have the haunting aftertaste of the previous serving, that's only because Nolan couldn't clone Heath Ledger. But beefy substitute Tom Hardy is a hell of a villain."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"If The Dark Knight Rises is a fascist film, it's a great fascist film, and arguably the biggest, darkest, most thrilling and disturbing and utterly balls-out spectacle ever created for the screen. It's an unfriendly masterpiece that shows you only a little circle of daylight, way up there at the top of our collective prison shaft - but a masterpiece nonetheless."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"Potent, persuasive and hypnotic, The Dark Knight Rises has us at its mercy. A disturbing experience we live through as much as a film we watch, this dazzling conclusion to director Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy is more than an exceptional superhero movie, it is masterful filmmaking by any standard."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"This is not the sort of movie you can just leave behind in the theater. And like any true finale to a trilogy, the picture doesn't work nearly as well if you haven't seen the previous two installments: It's not designed to stand alone, and it pays off all that has come before with an exuberant, thrilling high."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,Christopher Nolan's dramatically and emotionally satisfying wrap-up to the Dark Knight trilogy adroitly avoids clichés and gleefully subverts your expectations at every turn.
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"""The Avengers"" is kid stuff compared with this meditation on mortal loss and heroic frailty. For once a melodrama with pulp origins convinces viewers that it can be the modern equivalent to Greek myths or a Jonathan Swift satire. TDKR is that big, that bitter - a film of grand ambitions and epic achievement. The most eagerly anticipated movie of summer 2012 was worth waiting for."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"With spectacle in abundance and sexiness in (supporting) parts, this is superhero filmmaking on an unprecedented scale. Rises may lack the surprise of Begins or the anarchy of Knight, but it makes up for that in pure emotion."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"A smart, stirring spectacle that faces down impossible expectations to pull off a hugely satisfying end to business."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"Makes everything in the rival Marvel universe look thoroughly silly and childish. Entirely enveloping and at times unnerving in a relevant way one would never have imagined, as a cohesive whole this ranks as the best of Nolan's trio, even if it lacks -- how could it not? -- an element as unique as Heath Ledger's immortal turn in The Dark Knight. It's a blockbuster by any standard."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,91,The miracle of Nolan's Batman trilogy is the way it imprints those myths with the dread-soaked tenor of the times.
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,90,"While The Dark Knight Rises raises the dramatic stakes considerably, at least in terms of its potential body count, it doesn't have its predecessor's breathless sense of menace or its demonic showmanship, and with the exception of one audacious sleight-of-hand twist, the story can at times seem more complicated than intricate."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,88,"Nolan brings his Batman trilogy to a close with a majestic, almost completely satisfying crash. Everything feels epic about the film: the characters, the effects, the emotional stakes - even the missteps (and there are more than a few)."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,88,"It's not only packed with high-toned classical and contemporary cultural allusions, but manages to wear its popcorn inspirations on its sleeve."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,88,"Most important, does The Dark Knight Rises achieve the impossible, which is to bring a cherished cinematic chapter to a close, yet manage to leave fans feeling not desolate but cheered? To that all-important question, the answer is an unequivocal yes."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,88,"The Dark Knight Rises ultimately justifies its length (in fact, a good argument could be made for a longer cut) and the last 45 minutes is nothing short of spectacular. From the point where the narrative takes a leap of faith, it never lets up."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,88,The sheer scope of Nolan's vision – with emotion and spectacle thundering across the screen – is staggering. The Dark Knight Rises is the King Daddy of summer movie epics.
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,85,"As you might expect from the creator of ""Inception"" and ""Memento,"" there are surprises both in the story and in the storytelling. But the biggest surprise may just be how satisfying Nolan has made his farewell to a Dark Knight trilogy that many fans will wish he'd extend to a 10-part series, at least."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,80,"Believable and preposterous, effective as a closing chapter and somewhat of a letdown if only because Mr. Nolan, who continues to refine his cinematic technique, hasn't surmounted ""The Dark Knight"" or coaxed forth another performance as mesmerizingly vital as Heath Ledger's Joker in that film."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,80,"While director Christopher Nolan and star Christian Bale's epic of criminality and all-consuming conviction ultimately falls a bit short - missing, for instance, a villainous face a la Heath Ledger's Joker - their Batman trilogy ends with a suitably thrilling mix of guts and glory."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,80,"The Dark Knight Rises brings the Batman story to a close in enormous, satisfying fashion, not just on the huge scale it builds for itself, but on a human level as well."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,80,"It's spectacular, to be sure, but also remarkable for its all-encompassing gloom. No movie has ever administered more punishment, to its hero or its audience, in the name of mainstream entertainment."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,80,"The Dark Knight Rises may be a hammy, portentous affair but Nolan directs it with aplomb. He takes these cod-heroic, costumed elements and whisks them into a tale of heavy-metal fury, full of pain and toil, surging uphill, across the flyovers, in search of a climax."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,78,"I said once before that every generation gets the superhero it deserves, and Nolan's darkest of dark knights is surely ours – and no more so than in this current incarnation. (Granted, this doesn't bode well for society, but hey, things are bleak all over.)"
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"The Dark Knight aspires to the epic and reaches it on a number of impressive and less impressive levels. That it is a frequently, unnervingly glorious triumph of brawn over brains is not despite but in spite of Nolan's admirably stubborn - if persistently, risibly serious - insistence that the modern superhero can have it all."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"Director Christopher Nolan, who wrote the script with brother Jonathan, gets so many of the big things right that I wished they had taken more time with the little ones."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"The Dark Knight Rises is reasonably accomplished as a gigantic superhero movie; as a meditation on capital and its personal and social discontents, it's strictly from the funny pages."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"While it's the most ambitious of the three films, it's not as mesmerizing as 2008's ""The Dark Knight."" The plot is occasionally murky, its archvillain lacks charismatic menace, and the last hour is belabored."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"If you just give yourself over to Nolan's sweeping, symphonic Cowled Crusader saga, The Dark Knight Rises is, well, a blast."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,Christopher Nolan's capper of his Batman trilogy is a summer blockbuster of grand inclinations in both form and content.
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"The film begins slowly with a murky plot and too many new characters, but builds to a sensational climax."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"The Dark Knight Rises declares its importance with each scene but seldom backs up the claims. It is a climax more fitful than fulfilling, solemn to a fault and begging the Joker's question: ""Why so serious?"""
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"Chaos reigns for much of The Dark Knight Rises, often in big, beautiful, IMAX-size scenes that only Nolan could have conceived. Yet when the apocalyptic dust literally settles on this concluding chapter, the character who lingers longest in memory is an average Gotham City cop named John Blake, wonderfully played with human-scale clarity by Joseph Gordon-Levitt."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"A spectacular noir epic that's equal parts murky, bloated, flashy and triumphantly cinematic. Four years after Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" sequel ""The Dark Knight"" rattled audiences with a similar audiovisual overload, the new movie falls into the same rhythm and remains viscerally satisfying even when the story falters."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,70,"Christopher Nolan, for all his visionary flair, wants to suck the comic out of comic books; Anne Hathaway wants to put it back in. Take your pick."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,70,"A fine film in a strong summer, but it lacks the spark that made its immediate predecessor a masterpiece."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,63,"Now comes The Dark Knight Rises, which makes ""The Dark Knight"" look like ""Dora the Explorer"" and is more of a 164-minute anxiety disorder than a movie."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,60,"Doesn't rise as much as it flounders and frustrates, in what would appear to be a case of a filmmaker prioritizing ego over efficiency, and engaging in generally muddled storytelling."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,60,"Grand scale or no, this feels like a blockbuster on autopilot more often than not, curiously detached and self-importantly somber even by the director's standards - and without the cerebral heft of his best work."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,58,"Were it not for Anne Hathaway's Catwoman-ish Selina Kyle, there wouldn't be a single character in ""Rises"" who cracks a smile. I'm not arguing that ""Rises"" should be ""Singin' in the Rain."" But its Wagnerian ambitions are not matched by its material. It hasn't earned its darkness."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,50,"Moments are stretched. Every recollection must be illustrated by a flashback. Character motivations shift on a dime, and if you understand even half of what's going on - not generally, but specifically - you'll be doing better than most."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,40,"At over two hours and forty minutes long, with repeated scenes of bone-crunching violence and a maddeningly unrelenting percussive score by Hans Zimmer, The Dark Knight Rises is something of an ordeal to sit through."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,40,"The Dark Knight Rises is a shallow repository of ideas, but as a work of sheer sensation, it has something to recommend."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,30,"The script, by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, takes a few vague pokes at Wall Street and the financial elite but mainly revives the ponderous psychodrama of the first movie."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,25,"Halfheartedly, I give The Dark Knight Rises - the third and final Batflick in the Nolan trilogy - one star for eardrum-busting sound effects and glaucoma-inducing computerized images in blinding Imax, but talk about stretching things."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,100,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire more than makes the case for this as a franchise that's going to get better as it goes, and I am genuinely excited to see how they wrap it up."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,91,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is movie escapism made with intelligence, and that doesn't come around often enough. As I sensed this movie ending I wished it wouldn't, and when it did I wanted the next one now. Take that, Bilbo."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,91,"Catching Fire is a monumental achievement, a massively entertaining crowd-pleaser that is thought-provoking and personally inspiring in all of the ways that it aspires to be."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,90,"Catching Fire is exceptional entertainment, a spectacle with a good mind and a pounding heart."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,90,"[Francis] Lawrence and his team have calibrated the entire experience for maximum engagement. And while its pleasures can’t touch the thrill of seeing the Death Star destroyed — not yet, at least — the film runs circles around George Lucas’ ability to weave complex political ideas into the very fabric of B-movie excitement."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,88,"The result is not only a dramatic improvement over what was already an unusually smart and satisfying pop-cultural parable of insurgent 99-per-cent rebellion, but a very likely candidate for the all-time-great-sequel sweepstakes."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,88,"Very few people will take in this spectacle of a society amusing itself to death, of “reality games” and the vapid media hysteria that surrounds them, and not draw a parallel to our own televised bread and circuses. At its best, “Catching Fire” is a blockbuster that bites the culture that made it."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,88,Pop-culture escapism can be thrilling when dished out by experts. Katniss is a character worth a handful of sequels. And Lawrence lights up the screen. You'll follow her anywhere.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,88,"The screen translation of Catching Fire, the second volume of the series, offers its audience many of the elements that made The Hunger Games compelling, but adds to that by deepening the themes and emotional currents and traveling to darker destinations."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,88,Catching Fire makes only the occasional misstep.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,83,"As teencentric franchises go, I much prefer The Hunger Games to the blessedly expired “Twilight” films. For one thing, they employ much better actors. My favorite: Amanda Plummer, one of the best and most underused actresses in America, as one of the Quell contestants."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,83,Lawrence steps up. And her character's fierce independence provides a welcome alternative to certain vampire-fixated young-adult heroines who define themselves entirely through the attention of much-much-older men.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"With Catching Fire, director Lawrence certainly isn't afraid to bide his time and build anticipation for the truly spectacular (and tropical-tinged) Quarter Quell, patiently reestablishing crucial relationships for maximum dramatic pay-off."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"It’s a middle chapter, for sure, but a vigorous and fast-paced one that leaves you hungry for more."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"Spinning in that wedding dress, or glaring in wary repose, Lawrence catches fire on screen."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,An effective piece of melodramatic popular entertainment that savvily builds on the foundation established by the first Hunger Games movie.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"Catching Fire is a great leap forward for the franchise. Seeing as it’s all about hope and what it represents, here’s hoping the next two are just as good, if not better."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"The good news is it comes very close, and does it without sacrificing its soul. Despite its sense of been-here-slayed-that, director Francis Lawrence expertly delivers thrills, ideas and spectacle."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"It’s not just bigger, it’s better, and it bodes well for the future of the series, if not necessarily of its unlucky protagonist."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"Relatively speaking, Catching Fire is terrific. Even nonrelatively, it's pretty damn good."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"Defying rote heroics and sidestepping those solemn Frodoisms lurking in the role, Lawrence seeks out the complex, human and earthy in Katniss, still the beating heart and total triumph of these movies."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"It’s a critic’s instinct to auto-praise any blockbuster that tries to do something different, but Catching Fire is so committed to carrying on the fine work started by its predecessor that the applause flows utterly naturally."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,Catching Fire looks and feels epic. Hands down it’s one of the most entertaining films of the year.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"Catching Fire delivers on all the promise of Part 1 with a gutsier, tougher, better round of Games."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,79,"Everything that felt clumsy in The Hunger Games has been improved upon here. That's most apparent in the clarity of the action, but it also extends to how efficiently the film establishes so many new ensemble members."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,79,Steady-handed action is enough to elevate this film above its predecessor.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"With each on-screen chapter, the poor girl from District 12 continues to fulfill her destiny as an inspiration and a rebel fighter. She is but one female, but she's the perfect antidote to the surplus of male superheroes out there."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Best in its first hour, when it concentrates on the politics and the specific horrors of Panem. It becomes more conventional in the second half and loses steam, but it's always heading somewhere."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,Catching Fire is smoothly exciting but a bit of a tease.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Catching Fire is a work of thoughtful, emotionally engaging sci-fi — everything that its predecessor The Hunger Games was not."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Catching Fire has the bonus of a genuinely charismatic performer at its center. Jennifer Lawrence, now an Oscar winner thanks to ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" emotes like crazy throughout ""Catching Fire,"" but you never catch her acting."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Like too many franchise installments, Catching Fire builds to more of an ellipsis than a period, teasing the next chapter instead of providing closure. But isn’t that true of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as well? At least casual fans will only have to wait a year, not three, to see what happens next in this galaxy not so far away."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Catching Fire is bigger, better and broodier than the first film."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Yes, it’s the middle chapter and feels like it, but it’s never dull."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Francis Lawrence imbues the source material with visceral pleasure in well-wrought scenes vacillating between elaborate spectacle, breathtaking terror, and--occasionally--surprising beauty."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,70,"Insofar as Catching Fire does ignite, the match to the flame is Jennifer Lawrence, who gives Katniss layers she lacks even in the books’ fairly rich characterization."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,70,"Catching Fire isn’t a great work of art but it’s a competent, at times exciting movie and it does something that better, more artistically notable movies often fail to do: It speaks to its moment in time."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,70,"Catching Fire suffers from the movie equivalent of middle-book syndrome: The story is wayward and rangy, on its way to being something, maybe, but not adding up to much by itself. Still, it’s entertaining as civics lessons go, and it’s a more polished, assured picture than its predecessor."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,70,"This is a safe, serviceable, carefully crafted action drama in which the subversive seeds planted in the first story take welcome root."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,67,"Lawrence gives the same committed, heart-rending performance, and she’s even more saintly than before: The script never lets her fire an arrow except in self-defense, and she stubbornly defies Snow in public, though she knows the probable consequence is death. Hutcherson has more personality this time, yet Peeta doesn’t deepen as a character."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,67,"The Hunger Games franchise, both in print and onscreen, has been exceptionally clever about cozying away imaginative space for fans to fill in the blanks and cast themselves in the rich drama. That this latest film leaves us hungering for more only means that it’s working."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,63,Everyone hits their marks with gusto and believability in Catching Fire... But the engine of the entire operation is Jennifer Lawrence.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,63,"The ingredients are in place for a potent finale, but “Catching Fire” is watered down."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,63,"Crowd-pleasing and compelling, most of all because of its fiery, charismatic heroine."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,60,"A Matrix Reloaded–like cliffhanger reminds that this is only the second installment out of four (good lord), but at least the flick leaves us with more than a tinge of interest in whom the odds will favor next."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,60,"What lets the movie down is its heart, or lack thereof. The reprise of the Games introduces new adversaries (and some allies) but has exactly the same dynamic as in the first movie."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,50,"Yet, despite the good acting, the middle section of the film, set at the Capitol, is attenuated and rhythmless — the filmmakers seem to be touching all the bases so that the trilogy’s readers won’t miss anything."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,50,"Enough is enough. One good thing: The jungle scenes were shot in Hawaii, so at least they all got a paid vacation."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,50,"Deep thoughts about re-directing cynically manipulated celebrity, lump in the throat moments at people rising up against their oppressors, a couple of memorable deaths and attempts at sacrifice play as flat when there’s nothing around them to serve as contrast."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,75,"Lively is an odd word for something called Dead Man's Chest, but lively it is. You won't find hotter action, wilder thrills or loopier laughs this summer."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,75,"It's too long, unnecessarily complicated and often silly, but Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is still the purest popcorn entertainment of the summer."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,75,"The slow, uneven beginning is more than compensated for by the rousing climax."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,75,Two of the big action set-pieces easily outdo anything from the previous edition.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,75,"It does deliver a combustible combination of ingredients for a summer blockbuster: a cornucopia of action and dazzling effects, some raucous humor and a large dose of Depp's winning charm."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,75,Sufficiently resembles the first film that the heartiest fans should be content.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,70,"Depp is the comic gel that holds the whole enterprise together. The performance is a total delight that somehow combines Bugs Bunny, Peter Pan and Charlie Chaplin."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,70,A collection of swashbuckling set pieces with the hustle of a vaudeville show.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,67,"Verbinski, Depp and company just want to make it the best ride you've had all summer. If that's all you demand of a frothy summer blockbuster, then this delivers the goods."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,67,The movie's gross-out effects are impressive but wearying. How apt that the director's name is Gore.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,67,"It's all a bit much, yes, a bit exhausting, that's true, but then why on earth would anyone expect otherwise?"
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,63,"This chest is overfilled with exposition and physical comedy, without a doubloon's worth of the scary suspense that made the laughs in the first one such brilliant comic relief."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,63,"The summer's most anticipated film, and it gives fans what they want - then more of what they want, and more, and more, until gluttony becomes force-feeding."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,63,"You can't beat on Dead Man's on value-for-money terms, but it's like an all-you-can-eat buffet -- everything's tasty, the surfeit is sickening."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,63,"Again, as with ""Star Wars,"" the interest lies at least as much in the set design and costumes as the narrative."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,60,"Too long, and too wrapped up in its various plot contrivances to notice it’s veering off course. But Jack just about pulls the wheel back, aided by Verbinski’s flair for cartoonish comedy action."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,60,"Even more of a party-hearty-Marty potlatch of silliness than its predecessor. The franchise having been established, Verbinski, Bruckheimer, and Co. have been liberated to indulge in absurdities, pile on the so-old-they're-new-again clichés, and make jokes at their own expense."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,60,"Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley manage to sparkle, but this overstuffed sequel is no treasure."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,60,"Far too long, but thanks to Depp--and to Bill Nighy, properly mean beneath his suckers and blubber--it swerves away from the errors committed by the other big movies this summer."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,60,"The first of two sequels shot in immediate succession, Dead Man's Chest bears the unenviable burden of racking the pins for both movies, which leaves it with precious few opportunities to have a little fun of its own."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,58,There is a sense of bloat and where-do-we-go-from here aimlessness to this unconscionably protracted undertaking.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"Intermittently fun and high-spirited, Dead Man's Chest sags under the weight of its own running time."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"Dead Man's Chest is best summed up by the scene where Sparrow and Will battle each other atop a runaway water wheel. Like the characters, this movie is just running in circles."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"What do we want in a sequel? Just a little taste of the original or a triple serving piled high? Dead Man's Chest opts for the latter. This Disney movie isn't a follow-up to the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" so much as its empty-calorie clone."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,It batters you with novelty and works so hard to top itself that exhaustion sets in long before the second hour is over.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"The worst kind of sequel -- the kind that exists only to give you more-more-more of what you liked the first time around, without ever justifying its own existence. This lavish, superbly designed film goes on for an exhausting 2½ hours."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"A long, tedious and convoluted follow-up to 2003's rollicking high-seas hit, The Curse of the Black Pearl, this second installment in the promised trilogy lacks the swash and buckle of the original. And then some."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"I was worn down by the excess: Depp's fruity impersonation of Keith Richards (or William F. Buckley) as pirate Jack Sparrow; too many bottomless chasms on an island with too many jungle savages (after the fashion of Peter Jackson's King Kong); Bill Nighy playing too squishy a villain with a beard of too many crawling octopus tentacles; too much violence, pop nihilism, and sick humor."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"The effects are breathtaking, and much of the action is choreographed with energy and wit. (A chase sequence on a cliff uses visual gags that defy the laws of physics, Wile E. Coyote-style.) But all of these moments bob on the film's slick surface like so much flotsam. Without a beating heart at its center, this Chest feels empty indeed."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"Exactly the kind of thing most of us have in mind when we think ""popcorn movie."" It's largely brainless, pretty to look at, and produced solely as a lead-in to another moneymaking sequel for Disney."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"Whatever goodwill one harbored toward the first Pirates film is quickly dashed by its sneering successor, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, which is less a film than a two-and-a-half-hour trailer for the final installment in this accidental trilogy."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,40,"Infernally boring for much of its running time, and then, just as the pulse starts to quicken: To be continued."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,40,A noisy and lazy stopgap movie that goes absolutely nowhere and takes 2 1/2 hours to get there.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,38,"Yes indeed, Pirates 2.0 is a theme ride, if by ride you mean a hellish contraption into which a ticket holder is strapped, overstimulated but unsatisfied, and unable to disengage until the operator releases the restraining harness."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,33,"The second movie, Dead Man's Chest, is everything you feared the first would be: a theme-park spectacle lasting 2 1/2 hours."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,33,More than the usual bad or even numbingly horrible movie. It's an amalgam of many of the modern cinema's worst tendencies and modern filmmaking's most unfortunate misconceptions.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,88,"Another “Jurassic” flick wasn’t necessary, but it’s a fantastic ride all the same."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,84,"It’s a brave choice to literally blow up everything that’s come before but one that definitely pays off in Fallen Kingdom. While Jurassic World gave us a lovely self-contained story, Fallen Kingdom leaves us wondering just where the series will go for its third act - as long as Stiggy plays an extensive pivotal role, I’ll be absolutely fine with it."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,83,"Howard, thankfully, gets more to do than the last go round (and in combat boots, no less!), Pratt busts out his Indiana Jones cocktail of can-do heroism and deadpan jokiness, and Bayona and his screenwriters (Trevorrow and Derek Connolly) test the laws of incredulity with varying degrees of success. At least, until the final half hour when forehead-slapping absurdity finally win out. Up until then, Fallen Kingdom is exactly the kind of escapist summer behemoth you want it to be."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,80,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is boggled insanity of the highest and most enthralling sci-fi order. As exciting and wondrous a summer blockbuster audiences could ask for. You must suspend reality (EVEN FURTHER) and enter a world where dinosaurs have existed for years in order to attain circumstantial nirvana, but if done correctly, an absolute wealth of ceremonious riches await"
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,80,"The fear factor is back. This is a Jurassic sequel that plays it both adrenaline-pumpingly huge and thrillingly small. A summer ride that will drive kids out of their minds, and maybe even give the parents nightmares."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,75,"Howard and Pratt don’t get to do much besides run like hell, but a movie like this in a way emphasizes rather than obscures the importance of star quality. They’re just so good-looking that it’s a pleasure to watch them -- idealized surrogates for humanity."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,75,I like the new “Jurassic World” movie better than the 2015 edition. Bayona’s direction is considerably more stylish and actively mobile than Colin Trevorrow’s was.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,75,"“Fallen Kingdom” is a more interesting, and less obvious, story than the usual Tyrannosaurus romps, which tend to be death-defying games of hide-and-seek."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,70,A more thoughtful and interesting film than its immediate predecessor.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,70,"Bayona not only nods to the histories of classic monster movies and the legacy of original Jurassic helmer Steven Spielberg; he brings his own experience to bear, treating monsters like actual characters and trapping us in a vast mansion that's as full of secrets as the site of his breakthrough 2007 film The Orphanage."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,67,"Bayona fights against the script’s weaknesses to craft a movie that, against all odds, feels fresh, fun and even a bit vital. A lot of it’s dumb, and the human characters haven’t gotten any more compelling than they were in Jurassic World, but dammit, everything involving dinosaurs is top-notch."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,67,Those who just want to watch dinosaurs eat people in creative ways? They’re destined to get their money’s worth.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,67,"There is visual wit in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, and some invention, too."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,65,"There is a little bit of the wonder and joy that made the original so special embedded deep within Fallen Kingdom, which I credit to Bayona, whose primary drive, even in genre fare like this, has always been to sprinkle just enough emotion into the stories he tells."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,63,"The opening sections has a feel of a competent if familiar effects movie, but the film changes mood and tone when story movies the foreboding castle — perhaps a nod to Mary Shelley, among the first to warn us of the hazards of scientists who interfere with the natural order."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,63,"You can go see Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom or you can save yourself the time and money by chugging a six-pack of Red Bull and running through the dinosaur exhibits at the Harvard Museum of Natural History until you can’t breathe. As experiences go, they’re equally adrenalizing and equally ephemeral."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,63,"Has all the requisite rampaging dinos, dizzying action scenes and, sure, a few flesh-and-blood heroes running around saving the day. But there’s just not enough underneath that well-trod surface — an intriguing ethical conundrum bears heady fruit at times, yet is just as quickly shelved in favor of roaring lava or unleashed reptiles."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,63,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom will not stand up to rigorous scrutiny, and yet, it’s kind of an enjoyable, preposterous and thrilling ride that ticks through nostalgia beats like a shopping list."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,60,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is exactly what you think it’ll be. Whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing is up to you.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,60,"After a quarter-century the franchise may be terminally long in the teeth; much of this fifth iteration is absurd, both intentionally and un. Yet it’s also funny, intriguingly dark and visually sumptuous."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,60,"Fallen Kingdom understands the moral weight of the setup it’s been handed by the previous five movies. Even when it stumbles as a film, it has a definite point of view on what a humanity callous enough to revive a species for its own pleasure and inquiry ought to experience in return."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,60,"Fallen Kingdom understands that, as much as Jurassic Park has the shape of an action movie, its roots are in horror, and Bayona takes evident glee in drawing out his scares."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,60,"After a first half that suggests franchise fatigue is setting in, Fallen Kingdom zooms in for some scarily good set-pieces."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,60,"This fun, pacy addition to the dino disaster franchise doesn’t do much that’s particularly new – though what it does, it does with a fair whack of panache."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,58,"Pratt brings a wry derring-do to the mayhem, and the escape from Isla Nublar has its modicum of thrills."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,58,"For a movie that preaches the importance of dinosaur freedom, it’s hard to watch something so caged by its terrible plotting and predictability."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,55,"Normally, the creatures lend this series a built-in sense of awe and wonder. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom strips that majesty away and turns the focus on the human characters, who are markedly unengaging."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the latest installment, has more dinosaurs, more screams, and more general chaos, but doesn’t make a single move to explore a fresh idea or add a new slant on a tired old formula. As brainless summer-escapism movies go, this one can’t go fast enough."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"Here’s yet another incident-packed, steroid-pumped, dumb airport novel of a movie, with a few flourishes of Spielberg-inspired titanic imagery (though the director is J.A. Bayona) and a wall-to-wall John Williams-like orchestral score (by Michael Giacchino), with scenes that echo from the previous Jurassic Park movies."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"Fallen Kingdom is so committed to thunderous spectacle that it fails to capture the poetry of these beasts in all their spiky, scaly, long-necked wonder. They deserve better."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"Like almost every other major studio film this summer, Fallen Kingdom plays dumb, and happily."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"Even the heavenly chorus that’s working overtime  on the soundtrack can’t drown out the lack of chemistry between Howard and Pratt. And the movie too often defaults to people running around screaming — which is, to be fair, the backbone of this franchise, but it gets awfully old here."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"“Fallen Kingdom,” directed by J. A. Bayona, is in most respects a dumber, less ambitious movie than its immediate predecessor, and also, for just that reason, a little bit more fun. Some of its high jinks have a hokey, silly, old-fashioned mad-scientist feeling to them, especially when the dinosaurs are chasing people or vice versa. Which is reasonably often."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"J.A. Bayona's film never figures out what it wants to be, casting about for a coherent tone. Thanks in large part to Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow's script, it doesn't find one. But at least it has some fun making the effort."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"Cliffhanger elements aside, I have no desire to revisit this world again. It’s played out. There’s only so far you can go with dinosaur movie and this series has gotten to that point…and beyond. Fallen Kingdom isn’t dino-myte. It’s dino doo-doo."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"This is a movie that’s annoying in part because it doesn’t care if you’re annoyed by it. It doesn’t need you, the individual viewer, to like it. It just needs a crowd to see it. Whether you’ve been entertained or enlightened is immaterial. It’s Barnum time. You don’t like it? This way to the egress."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"This sequel has the perfunctory vibe that comes from filmmakers who cynically believe the public will buy anything T. Rex-related, no matter how shoddy the goods or warmed-over the plot."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"The special effects remain startling, and in your face. But there's nothing new here, and what's old feels like less. The corporate villains seem to have wandered over from ""Rampage."" The humor has vanished."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"J.A. Bayona's gothic flourishes suggest opioid hallucinations, and they're a welcome escape from the doldrums of the writing, but they seem at odds with the rest of the film."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"Too often, Fallen Kingdom has all the soul and grace of a well-prepared business proposal—you can sense all the money being invested into an intellectual property in order to reap a sizable windfall and ensure the franchise’s continued commercial viability. It’s as scintillating as a retirement plan."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,The movie plays like a strenuous imitation of Steven Spielberg instead of the real deal.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"It’s possible to watch this movie, in other words, and feel that the series is carving out a new direction, returning to its ancient stomping grounds and sticking to a familiar holding pattern, all at the same time. Such is the repetitive, rudderless nature of so much big-budget franchise filmmaking, even with a proven talent like Bayona behind the camera."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"Spain’s J. A. Bayona is essentially stirring the same Jurassic pot here, with little that’s inspiring from his cast, unless you count the dinosaurs."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"It looks and feels familiar, and in an era where studio filmmaking has increasingly become an extension of brand management, that should make a lot of people happy. But I can’t say it made me particularly happy."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"The first “Jurassic World” was, quite simply, not a good ride. “Fallen Kingdom” is an improvement, but it’s the first “Jurassic” film to come close to pretending it isn’t a ride at all, and as a result it ends up being just a passable ride."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,42,"The film may deliver the spectacle of dinosaurs body-slamming other dinosaurs with their mouths, but that’s about all that connects Fallen Kingdom to the wonder and fright of the original film. As a horror movie, it’s diverting enough when it’s not continuously shooting itself in the foot with ideas it can’t explain and doesn’t care to."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,42,"Like an amusement ride on its last legs, there is no wonder in this world anymore; just the repetition of cheap, worn-out jolts. The park is gone, and with it, so is any semblance of humanity."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,42,The Fallen Kingdom is at its worst when attempting topicality (the testosterone-fueled Wheatley refers to one of our heroes as a “nasty woman”) or when beefing up its crass plot.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,40,"In a film about resurrected dinosaurs, suspension of disbelief is mandatory, but the script’s illogical nonsense and flat, cartoonish characters compound on each other until any audience goodwill has evaporated."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,40,"The film staples together two snazzy-sounding ideas – an ecologically inclined disaster movie with dinosaurs, and, later, dinosaurs on the loose inside a stately home – without considering whether the end product’s sheer snarling hideousness might just prove an intelligence-insulting turn-off."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,40,"There are some reasonably entertaining scenes and set pieces, but the whole concept feels tired and contrived, and crucially the dinosaurs themselves are starting to look samey, without inspiring much of the awe or terror they used to"
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,38,"There are at least four movies stuffed into Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, and about a third of one of them isn’t half bad. I don’t think that math adds up to a decent film, but if all you need is a roaring dinosaur every 15 minutes or so, it might not matter."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,38,"How bad is “Fallen Kingdom”? How terrible is a movie that pounds us with a pretentious, nearly operatic score while indulging in B-movie clichés and calling for the main characters to make idiotic decisions just to keep the story rolling? I have to dig deep into the Awful Sequel Playbook to draw parallels to this exercise in wretched excess."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,38,"I was one of the few naysayers when the franchise was rebooted with “Jurassic World,” yet even with the bar set lower for expectations on this one, I found it “Transformers” boring, a summer movie that however much it earns, fails to justify its existence."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,37,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom finds another way to grow: by making its plot much, much bulkier. In doing so, it commits the worst possible sin: It makes dinosaurs boring."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,35,"Bayona, the Spanish director who first emerged with his terrific horror film The Orphanage, does his best to inject some more intimate action into a series that usually operates on an epic scale, but he’s working with too absurd a plot for his craft to really matter."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,30,While it has its moments of passable action -- ends up feeling every bit as toothless as its dinosaurs are toothy.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,30,This isn’t just a film you need to “turn off your brain” to enjoy; nothing less than surgically removing your brain from your body would do the trick.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,30,"The major problem with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom — the fifth installment in this dinosaur series, and the second of a prospective trilogy — is that the makers treat the action and suspense sequences in the way most of us go to the dentist."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,91,"While the villains are standard issue evil, Wonder Woman is remarkable in the genre for its early 20th century setting and Gadot's galvanizing performance."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,91,"Wonder Woman is smart, slick, and satisfying in all of the ways superhero films ought to be. How deliciously ironic that in a genre where the boys seem to have all the fun, a female hero and a female director are the ones to show the fellas how it’s done."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,91,"Wonder Woman is as much about a superhero rising as it is about a world deserving of her, and Diana’s hard-won insistence on battling for humanity (no matter how frequently they disappoint) adds the kind of gravitas and emotion that establishes it as the very best film the DCEU has made yet. There’s only one word for it: wonderful."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,90,"Caught up in the coils of Princess Diana’s hot lasso, I am bound to tell the truth: Wonder Woman is wonderful, and the Woman herself, as played by Gal Gadot, is the dazzling embodiment of female empowerment. She is also learned, charmingly funny and, for a goddess, touchingly human."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,90,"Wonder Woman emerges as not only the strongest movie in the present DC cycle, but also the first one that feels like an enveloping, honest-to-God entertainment rather than a raging cinematic migraine."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,90,"We get it, and DC finally should, too: Superhero movies can be fun. And Wonder Woman is a movie that'd send even the Suicide Squad home smiling."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,90,"In the recent flood of superhero movies, several have managed to be quite good — but Wonder Woman ranks as one of the few great ones."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,88,"While having a female director perhaps gives Wonder Woman a subtly different perspective, the real strengths of this production are its lead actors, the period piece setting, and an unexpected emotional resonance that one doesn’t expect from a popcorn movie."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,88,"Diana’s a superhero without a chip on her shoulder; she was raised in love, and Gadot lets that belief shine through her eyes. You’re both drawn to this woman and in awe of her."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,88,"Director Patty Jenkins’ origin story is packed with heart and empathy, and we have Gadot’s endearing performance to thank for that — but it’s also a byproduct of the timeline."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,88,"A genuinely surprising film that plays with genre and throws out the now very tired superhero movie formula. It’s an action film, a romantic comedy and a coming-of-age story and a period piece and a war movie all in one. Above all, it’s a hopeful story about humanity."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,88,"For the first time in a long time, I came out of a DC comic book movie feeling ready for a sequel. It feels right, at this actual historical moment, when men made of something less than steel are bumbling around trying to run things. Paging Paradise Island!"
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,87,"Wonder Woman represents a number of delicate balancing acts: between humor and gravitas; angst and adventure; full-blown, unvarnished superhero fantasy and the DCEU’s usual unpacking of what those fantasies mean."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,83,"At times, Wonder Woman feels like watching Splash with a shield — another babelicious naïf breaking all the rules. Yet the joke isn't on her. It's on all the men mistaking unsophistication for weakness. To be uncultured is to be mentally free; no one's put on a yoke. That's what makes Wonder Woman a knockout."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,83,"Throughout Wonder Woman there is an earnestness in tone that plays well, and rarely as saccharine."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,83,"This film is a goddamned blast. To merely call it the strongest entrant in the DC Entertainment Universe so far is to call Jaws the strongest entrant in the shark movie canon. Say what you will about Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne, and Deep Blue Sea, but Wonder Woman is in another class altogether."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,This is a movie about battling evil that pauses to ask what evil is and whether it’s necessary to understand its nature in order to defeat it.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"Gadot is simply marvelous. Physically, she’s bold and commanding. But there’s a sweetness about her too, as if she and Jenkins understand intuitively that Wonder Woman can’t just be blandly awesome. She's got to be able to feel wonder too."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"Its earnest insouciance recalls the “Superman” movies of the ’70s and ’80s more than the mock-Wagnerian spectacles of our own day, and like those predigital Man of Steel adventures, it gestures knowingly but reverently back to the jaunty, truth-and-justice spirit of an even older Hollywood tradition."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,This really is Wonder Woman coming to the rescue of the DC Comics universe.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"Gadot is a godsend, Pine charms, and Jenkins delivers old-school thrills with heart and conviction."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"If the action in Wonder Woman comes less frequently than you might expect, it’s also thrillingly designed and staged, with a surging sense of real people, from all sorts of backgrounds, swept up in the wider conflict’s churns and jolts."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"As Diana, Gadot is excellent, a rocking electric cello riff in human form."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"Wonder Woman is a gorgeous, powerful display of epic storytelling that makes me wish this was Gadot’s first chance to play Diana Prince. It’s the roaring introduction she deserves, and a hopeful shift in DC culture that hints at what’s about to come."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"Wonder Woman is the first major studio superhero film directed by a woman, and it shows in a number of subtle, yet important ways."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,79,"Wonder Woman is leaps and bounds above the other three entries in the DCEU. With a dramatic setting, a few entertaining action scenes, and a strong supporting cast all working together to tell an inspirational Hero’s Journey, it more than offsets some occasionally uneven acting on Gadot’s part and some shaky technical aspects."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,78,"This, uh, wonderfully directed and near-perfectly cast iconic heroine female empowerment story is so similar in tone and feel to Marvel Studios’ ""Captain America"" that I was waiting for Stan Lee to show up, possibly as a eunuch."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,"Wonder Woman may not qualify as a particularly suspenseful First World War movie and it may not feature enough globe-spinning special effects to satisfy hard-core superhero fans, but it certainly is an intriguing combination of the two genres."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,"Pine makes a perfect foil for Gadot’s furrowed-brow sincerity, his Steve Trevor wry and comfortable enough in his skin to hold his own with Diana (even when she’s scrutinizing his naked form)."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,"Jenkins and her collaborators have done what I thought was previously impossible: created a Wonder Woman film that is inspiring, blistering, and compassionate, in ways that honor what has made this character an icon."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,"Wonder Woman may not cure all the ills of pop culture’s superhero-saturation syndrome; in fact, in many ways it succumbs to some of its worst excesses. But at least it brings an exhilarating, vicarious kick to the sagging, bagging table."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,"The first two hours run the gamut from interesting to delightful. The final 20 minutes are roaring, ridiculous business as usual. We should be thankful the tide of mediocrity is held back as long as it is."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,Wonder Woman achieves touching and powerful moments that are unusual for a movie of this kind.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,72,"Wonder Woman won’t reinvent the superhero franchise, or the origin story. But it does show how compelling they can still be, when someone is allowed to do them right."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,70,The violence and fights in Wonder Woman are intriguing not just because they’re stunning but also because of how emotional they are.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,70,"Gadot is terrific, capturing perfectly the grace, power and heroism of the Amazonian princess who must make herself present in the world to save it."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,70,"Though the action...sometimes has a slightly distracting video game feel, it’s often stirring stuff, and it’s skillfully integrated into the developing relationship between the title character and her mortal man."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,70,"Wonder Woman is exciting, romantic, funny — and my favorite DC Extended Universe movie to date. With her courage and strength, Diana sets an example for everyone she meets, and she holds fast to her ideals even under great pressure. With any luck, she’ll provide similar inspiration to the directors of the DC Extended Universe in the years ahead."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,70,"As with all comics-based extravaganzas, brevity is anathema to the Patty Jenkins-directed Wonder Woman, and it doesn’t quite transcend the traits of franchise product as it checks off the list of action-fantasy requisites."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,67,The best parts of Wonder Woman are frivolous in the best way.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,67,"The best thing about Wonder Woman, the overlong and intermittently enjoyable new DC superhero spectacular, is Wonder Woman herself."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,63,"Gadot proves she is worthy of Wonder Woman’s tiara, but the superhero deserves a great film, not one that’s just better than the others."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,63,"Wonder Woman is a strong, at times even rousing, application of the superhero film formula, but it ultimately can’t transcend the constraints of the genre."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,63,"The movie is a derivative hash of comic book picture plot points and origin story touchstones — half “Captain America: The First Avenger,” half “Thor.” But director Patty Jenkins, who did not get enough credit for “Monster,” keeps Gadot in frame and the tone light."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,63,The star is unstoppable and spectacular to see in motion. Watch her fly.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,60,"Wonder Woman is not a great film, nor is it the feminist glass ceiling-smasher that many had hoped for. But after the offensively stupid Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman feels nothing short of revelatory."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,60,"The only grace note in the generally clunky Wonder Woman is its star, the five-foot-ten-inch Israeli actress and model Gal Gadot, who is somehow the perfect blend of superbabe-in-the-woods innocence and mouthiness."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,58,"Yes, it’s the DCEU’s best film, but as we know, that’s not saying a lot. But, hey, that terrific second act that we should cling to even if it’s a distant memory by the time love defeats aggression. “Wonder Woman” might be molded by the mighty Gods, but as shaped by mere mortals her mettle and beliefs and can be only so wonderfully divine."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,50,"When the separatist compound must accommodate an interloper — Steve Trevor, fished out of the sea by Diana after his plane goes down — any hopes that Wonder Woman will sustain its appealing misandry are soon dashed."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,40,"It’s plagued by the same problems that dragged down previous visits to the DC movie world: over-earnestness, bludgeoning special effects, and a messy, often wildly implausible plot. What promised to be a glass-ceiling-smashing blockbuster actually looks more like a future camp classic."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,91,"Iron Man 3 is an ominously exciting, shoot-the-works comic-book spectacular."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,88,"Thanks to Downey’s genius, Iron Man 3 is equally terrific, whether Tony’s fending off an army of villains or bantering with a kid in a shed on a cold, snowy night."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,88,"A madly creative, darkly comical, and fiendishly self-aware actioner with muscle to spare."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,83,"Downey, Jr. remains a rightfully cherished smartass figure, having as much a ball with Black’s one-liners as he had in “KKBB,” and he sells Tony’s newfound post-traumatic vulnerability more credibly than the film does."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,80,"Besides rehabbing a hero who overcomes anxiety to save the world and defeat the terror-industrial complex by the simple matter of cloning his body armor, the movie proves that there’s still intelligent life on Planet Marvel. As you’re propelled out of the theater on IM3′s hydraulic lift of pleasures, you’re likely to say, “That is how it’s done.”"
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,80,It sharply fuses the humor and heart of the earlier films with a satisfyingly heavy-metal strength — and a darkness that’s more than earned.
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,80,"Funny, twisty and thrilling, this is shellhead’s most entertaining solo flight to date. It’s also an impressive pace-setter for this summer’s barrage of big movies."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,80,"Black proves the perfect blacksmith, forging smart new tech and scenarios for the swaggering super-genius. If this does turn out to be Downey Jr.’s final solo outing, it’s a very strong exit."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,80,"Black and his co-screenwriter, first-timer Drew Pearce, have great fun reshuffling the deck, teasing about who might occupy what superhero suit and morphing the story along with identity revelations and expansions of the dramatic horizons; the well-chosen cast members respond in kind with virtually palpable glee."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,80,Black has an instinctive feel for balancing action set-pieces against the passages of soap-opera that are required to make them matter.
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,80,"Iron Man 3 is smart, funny and spectacular."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,75,"The balance between human interaction and mechanical mayhem works well until the end, when flying suits and exploding bodies fill the screen."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,75,"It's solidly entertaining, with Downey's roguish charm as appealing as ever."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,75,"The rambunctious Iron Man 3 is a briskly paced thrill ride until about 90 minutes in, when the excitement wanes. A few late-breaking surprises re-invigorate the tale, however."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,75,"Iron Man 3 has the stuff to please the devotees and divert everyone else, which is pretty much what's expected from the curtain-raiser of any summer season."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,75,"For all the film's flaws, Black brings enough to the table that it's far from a chore, and if this level of ingenuity and surprise can be maintained, there'll be no need for Tony to hang up his Iron Man helmet any time soon."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,70,"At least this time ""Goopy"" Paltrow gets to perform a few superheroics herself, along with enduring some heavy-duty torture that’s bound to please her haters — for whom the sight of the top of her face being peeled off in ""Contagion"" was like Christmas in July."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,70,"Black and company throw all kinds of stuff at the audience, and though it doesn't all work, a lot of it does and the attempt to be different and create unguessable twists is always appreciated."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,70,"As far as bored and cynical, playing-out-the-string comic-book action sequels go – hey, Iron Man 3 is a pretty good one!"
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,70,"Downey is as funny as ever, if not more so. He ensures that Iron Man 3 is a solid installment in the franchise, and helps to make it seem, at least for a time, that it might be something more."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,67,"Iron Man 3 is missing that old Tony Stark spark. Not from Robert Downey Jr., who is still the best thing about this overblown show."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,63,"Iron Man 3 builds on the first film's political cynicism by suggesting that politicians and arms dealers dream up foreign policy crises to consolidate power and make money, but it doesn't develop this notion in detail, because if it did, the audience would tune out."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,63,"The real question for audiences isn’t whether Tony Stark/Iron Man defeats the latest supervillain (of course he does), but whether the movie itself rises above the dreaded third-in-a-sequel torpor of ""Spider-Man"" and ""The Dark Knight."" Spoiler alert: Yes, mostly, it does."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,63,"A big, kabooming sequel that plays sleight-of-hand with its audience."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,63,"For all the clanking armies of iron knights on display to dazzle the eager kid in each of us, this summer epic rings hollow. There's no one home inside the suit."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,63,"Marvel Studios will only be able to draw from this well only so many times, though, before fatigue sets in."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,63,The best scenes are when Stark just cuts impatiently through the claptrap.
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,63,"It's not without its payoffs; I enjoyed a lot of it. But overall last year's ""Avengers"" delivered the bombastic goods more efficiently than this year's Marvel."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,63,"The broad, goofy jokes and one-liners land — even if they feel a little winded, this time."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,60,"In other words, Iron Man 3 -- once more delivering a satisfying combination of humor, action and dazzling set pieces -- provides everything fans of the franchise expect."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,60,"Given the keys to the franchise and a role in the writing, Black has massively upped the verbal sparring and kept the broad inventiveness of comic-book malleability in mind. “I’m a mechanic,” Stark says to the boy in a moment of self-doubt. That’s 100% Black, that line, a tidy code of craft, and the jitters pass."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,60,It’s undeniably entertaining – and worth seeing for Kingsley alone – with the misfires never fully overshadowing the moments of glory.
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,58,"Here, it’s hard not to wish Downey were sparring with his costumed comrades again, instead of trading barbs with the far-less-colorful cast members — old and new — of this busy, sporadically diverting sequel."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,"The action, directed by Shane Black, ranges from passable to interminable. The plot goes from clang to bang. Downey Jr. is still the best thing about this series."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,The third iteration of a franchise that began so well becomes a hollow hymn to martial gadgetry. The suits and story clank in unison.
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,"A frantic, occasionally funny, finally enervating bricolage of special effects, explosive set pieces, sardonic one--liners and notional human emotions, this branch of the Marvel franchise tree feels brittle and over--extended enough to snap off entirely."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,"Unfortunately, that sharp-eyed domestic comedy is dwarfed by the far less well-written supervillain crime plot that surrounds it."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,"Judged solely in comparison to its corporate cousins, Iron Man 3 is a defective model. It’s lightweight but slow, padded with cheap jokes to disguise how hollow it is."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,"The film provides more of the same and nothing startlingly innovative, but what's here is good."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,"The big problems with Iron Man 3 are less specific to the movie itself than they are characteristic of the hypermalaise that’s infected so many current mega-blockbusters—too much plot, too much action, too many characters, too many pseudo-feelings."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,"Iron Man 3 is more perfunctory and workmanlike than its two predecessors, but this solid production still delivers more than enough of what fans expect."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,Stuff blows up and then more stuff blows up because that’s what happens when diversions like this hit movie screens around this time of year: chaos reigns and then some guy cleans it up.
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,40,"The villains are all wrong, the motivations are muddy, even the gadgetry is off. And the swaggering genius at the center of it all has become a preening fool."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,100,"At the root of that is Civil War’s greatest strength – and the reason it makes all thought of the recent Batman v Superman debacle evaporate on contact. The Russos’ film has an unshakeable faith in these decades-old characters: they’re not wrangled into standing for anything other than who they are, with no gloss or reinterpretation or reach for epic significance required. This is the cinematic superhero showdown you’ve dreamt of since childhood, precisely because that’s everything – and all – it wants to be."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,100,"What makes Captain America: Civil War such a terrific accomplishment is the way it takes what could have been the most crass and overcrowded story to adapt as a film and instead transforms it into an examination of just who these heroes are and what impact they’ve had on the world around them, and vice versa."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,100,"If there’s a risk of the Marvel ‘formula’ becoming stale, there isn’t any evidence of that here. Civil War isn’t just a damn-near-perfect popcorn crowd-pleaser; it doesn’t offer any easy answers for its combatants, or the world going forward. Team Cap or Team Iron Man? The real winner here is Team Marvel."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,100,"Matching its blockbuster scale and spectacle with the smarts of a great, grown-up thriller, Captain America: Civil War is Marvel Studios’ finest film yet."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,91,"More than any previous Marvel adaptation, Civil War conveys the comics' light touch amid somber circumstances. In a bold stroke, those circumstances are of the heroes' own making."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,91,"Despite its stars-and-stripes title, Marvel’s latest billion-dollar-blockbuster-to-be, Captain America: Civil War, is essentially a third Avengers movie – it’s also the best one yet."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,91,"Striking and consistently engaging, the Russos deftly craft compelling blockbuster entertainment out of a a moral and emotional conflict, and that’s more impressive than any overblown display of loud and vulgar power."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,90,"The conflict between Iron Man and Captain America drives a wedge through this community of heroes. And they fight, in one of the most joyous cinematic superhero battles ever filmed, the closest thing we’ve seen to an on-screen splash page."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,90,“Civil War” strikes that admirable balance: serious-minded action that never forgets to indulge in serious fun.
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,88,"At the end of the day, it’s still a comic-book movie, but one that actually raises serious questions about security, accountability and revenge."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,88,Captain America: Civil War appeals to me more strongly than any superhero movie of the last decade.
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,88,In nearly every way Civil War represents the dizzying heights of the genre.
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,88,"Kudos to the Russo brothers, Joe and Anthony, for directing the hostilities for maximum impact and without neglecting character. Their thundering epic is also smart,  snappy, politically savvy and blessedly fast on its feet."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,88,"After the nihilistic deconstruction of Deadpool and the flattening self-importance of Batman v. Superman, Captain America: Civil War reminds you how funny and exciting these pictures can be when they’re done right — you know, like comic books. The summer movie season has barely begun, and already the remedy for superhero film fatigue has arrived."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,88,Captain America: Civil War is a classic example of what the big-ticket summer movie experience is all about.
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,88,"While it’s not the greatest Marvel effort — that honor goes to the previous Captain America: The Winter Soldier — Civil War does pull outstanding performances from its two franchise faces, Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,85,"The way in which Captain America: Civil War brings together a dozen or so heroes, sorts them into not one but two teams and then flings them at each other is its own special delight for comic book fans long accustomed to such things on the printed or digital page. And it must be pretty exciting for non-fans, too."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,84,"In terms of narrative ambition, and giving meaningful screen time to an ever-growing stable of onscreen characters, Civil War rivals Joss Whedon's MCU standout The Avengers. And in terms of sheer thrill, it surpasses Avengers — at least for fans who come prestocked with an emotional investment in these characters."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,83,"That Civil War doesn’t collapse under the weight of its various moving parts, that it manages to be the most serious entry yet in this franchise of franchises without sacrificing much in the way of valuable comic relief, is a testament to the creative mojo of directors Joe and Anthony Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,83,"By firmly rooting all of the film’s sprawling drama in a singular conflict, directors Joe and Anthony Russo manage to do what many superhero films have struggled with in recent years: find a truly effective reason to pit superpower against superpower."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,80,"Marvel’s new “Captain America” is anything but bleak — what’s so audacious about the film, and so pleasing, is its quicksilver mix of hardcore action and bright comedy."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,80,"Fun, happily, is one of the many ingredients in copious supply here."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,80,"It’s that rare superhero movie that doesn’t grind you down with nonstop action or, worse yet, the usual tiresome cavalcade of smart-ass wisecracks."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,80,"It’s a huge aspartame rush of a film: a giant irresistible snack, not nutritious, but very tasty."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,80,"A nagging sense of incompleteness means that Civil War isn’t quite as satisfying as the first ‘Avengers’ (it’s all building up to the ‘Infinity War’ two-parter in 2018). But overall, this is Marvel at their best: a pacey, intelligent super-sized blockbuster and a roaringly fun night out."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,80,"This chronicle of an epic clash between two equally noble factions, led by Captain America and Iron Man, proves as remarkable for its dramatic coherence and thematic unity as for its dizzyingly inventive action sequences."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,80,"Civil War is an exciting, often giddy pop pleasure."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,80,"While slightly overlong, this movie is bright, creative, insightful, affecting and, above all else, fun."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,78,"Civil War’s main battle sequence is so effective because it’s six-on-six, and we’ve spent the past decade getting to know the combatants."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,75,"Who emerges as the winner of this “Civil War”? The audience. The picture delivers in a big, big way."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,75,"The bad news is, there are about ten movies going on in Captain America: Civil War, which is at least seven too many. The good news is, most of them are fun, and there are enough rousing moments to elevate the movie to Marvel's top tier."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,75,"Those who attend this movie expecting to see a superhero smack-down won’t be disappointed, but anyone partial to Captain America’s saga may feel shortchanged."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,75,"With every new installment of the comic book franchise, the scale gets bigger, relationships get trickier, new forces enter the fray."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,75,"They’ve built up a vast ensemble of character types, all of them played by better-than-average actors, and that they can mix and match the drama, comedy, or action as they see fit."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,75,"Crisply photographed, thoughtfully acted and often refreshingly amusing, “Civil War” injects doses of much-needed fun into a genre of filmmaking that’s become mired in dour pretentiousness, when it’s not ridiculing its own excesses in such meta-snark exercises as “Deadpool.”"
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,75,"Thanks to strong performances, deft writing, and clear, snappy direction and editing, this newest volume of the Marvel Cinematic Universe manages to be at once a thoroughly entertaining standalone story while also serving and benefiting from stories that came before."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,75,"Nothing in “Civil War” takes your breath away. All the exteriors are shrouded in the same overcast, indistinct light. Little in story terms is what you’d call daisy fresh. But almost everything in it works on its own prescribed terms, and the quiet moments register."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,70,"This very crowded, reasonably enjoyable installment in the Avengers cycle...reveals, even more than its predecessors, an essential truth about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It’s not so much a grand science-fiction saga, or even a series of action-adventure movies, as a very expensive, perpetually renewed workplace sitcom."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,70,"If you live and breathe Marvel, this is one of the MCU's stronger offerings. If you are a spy coming in from the cold, the answer is not so clear."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,70,"Posing serious questions about violence and vigilantism while reveling in both, Captain America: Civil War is overlong but surprisingly light on its feet. It builds upon the plotlines of previous Avengers outings, bringing together known marquee quantities and introducing the Black Panther and a new Spidey in winning fashion."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,67,"The action, directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, is thuddingly effective without being terribly imaginative, but at least it’s not in the clobber-the-audience “Transformers” category."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,63,The undeniable fun of Civil War's action scenes only exacerbates the failure of the narrative to adequately contend with its own themes.
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,60,I personally find the Russo brothers’ lightning-fast action scenes difficult to process — it’s as if cinema editing now exceeds the speed of human brain functions — but they’re undoubtedly exciting and skillfully constructed.
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,60,"Those who sit through its talky, belabored first half will be rewarded first and foremost with the finest fight scene of any ""Avengers"" film to date, one that doubles as a satisfyingly popcorny start to the summer season."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,60,The best way to think of Captain America: Civil War is as a toy box in which the sheer quantity of toys partly makes up for the lack of anything new. But the big takeaway is worrisome. Marvel has created a universe teeming with superheroes who simply don’t have enough to do. They’re all suited up with nowhere to go.
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,60,"I never found myself genuinely wondering what was going to happen next; the moves are too familiar. Even the big fight, entertaining as it is, feels like it's there not because of dramatic inevitability, but because somebody behind a desk decided it had to be. It's just a bunch of stuff."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,60,"There's a certain bloatedness to much of the first half, while the film in general lacks the balance of humour to hard-hitting found in Shane Black's superb Iron Man 3 and/or Whedon's two Avengers outings."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,50,"As the feigning wears off, and Captain America: Civil War crawls to a close, you sense that the possibilities of nature have been not just exceeded but exhausted. Even the dialogue seems like a special effect: “You’re being uncharacteristically non-hyperverbal,” Black Widow remarks to Iron Man. Translation: “Say something.”"
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,50,"After the first two “Captain America” entries, the finest comic-book movies of the last five years, this one is disappointing. The story doesn’t make sense."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,50,Robert Downey Jr. gets to remind everybody that before this blockbuster turn he was actually a serious actor and may still be again. Stark’s frustration at the rigidity and short-sightedness of his confreres and his anguish at where it all leads are vivid and felt.
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,50,"There’s a “for fans only” feel to the latest “Avengers” movie, Captain America: Civil War, that won’t be to every taste. A talky, often ponderous exercise in comic book movie elephantiasis, it overdoses on characters, old and new, sometimes not even bothering to name them."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,50,"Sometimes, more is less. Although it’s called Captain America: Civil War, the latest Marvel movie is actually a supersized “Avengers” picture -- overstuffed to bursting."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,50,"The bigger these movies become, the smaller they feel. The more aggressively they reach for greatness, the more clearly they prove that its beyond their grasp. Marvel movies don't get much better than this. The trouble is, they don't want to."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,100,"It is a thrilling, intelligent, deeply-felt movie that does not play by the typical rules of franchise building in modern Hollywood."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,100,"Despite its well-worn ideas and themes, Gary Ross’s provocative, pulse-surgingly tense adaptation couldn’t feel fresher, or timelier."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,100,As tough-spirited as fans would hope for - and exciting and thought-provoking in a way few adventure dramas ever are.
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,91,"A muscular, honorable, unflinching translation of Collins' vision. It's brutal where it needs to be, particularly when children fight and bleed."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,90,"As action, as allegory, as cinema, The Hunger Games is the best American science-fiction film since ""The Matrix,"" and if Ross and his crew stay with the series for the next two books, we may get that rarest of things: a blockbuster franchise that earns our money through craft, emotion and execution, not merely marketing and effects."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,88,"My advice is to keep your eyes on Lawrence, who turns the movie into a victory by presenting a heroine propelled by principle instead of hooking up with the cutest boy."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,88,"A film that transforms a popular work of teen fiction not just by faithfully exploring its themes but, more important, by proving those themes have a very grown-up resonance."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,85,"There's action here, too, and a great deal of vitality that feels true both to the spirit of Collins' book and to the idea of movie entertainment as it exists."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,83,"Ultimately, Ross hasn’t just successfully mounted an adaptation of a hot literary property, or even launched a film series that earns the right to be a franchise. He’s produced an engaging, thoughtful, populist piece of entertainment that transcends gender, genre or source material."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,83,"Leaner than ""Harry Potter's"" adventures, meaner than the ""Twilight"" saga, The Hunger Games lives up to its source if not entirely the hype."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,80,"The Hunger Games looks poised to usher in a brand new hit franchise and deserves all the credit it gets for its confrontational subject matter, delicately-orchestrated fight sequences and sci-fi sensibilities. For teen audiences, films don't get much darker - or smarter - than this."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,80,"Katniss is gritty, she's flinty, she's intimidating -- and she doesn't have to compromise one iota of her femininity for it. And Ross' movie tells her story wonderfully."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,80,"Making a successful Hunger Games movie out of Suzanne Collins' novel required casting the best possible performer as Katniss, and in Jennifer Lawrence director Gary Ross and company have hit the bull's-eye, so to speak."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,80,"If the movie had a lead actress more delicate or malleable than the strong-cheeked Lawrence-a Natalie Portman, say-it would tip over into sexy-girl-killer celebration; the same goes for Harrelson's salty mentor, who is never too supportive or paternal.  Both performers lean into the economies of survival, certain of the savagery that lies ahead, and come up with sharp work."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,80,"What's remarkable is the lack of cheese. Tacky effects, corny dialogue and creaky performances are all shown the door. We repeat: not the new ""Twilight""."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,80,"The Hunger Games is that rarest of beasts: a Hollywood action blockbuster that is smart, taut and knotty. Ably filleted from the Suzanne Collins bestseller, it's a compelling, lightly satirical tale."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,80,As thrilling and smart as it is terrifying. There have been a number of big-gun literary series brought to screen over the past decade. This slays them all.
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,78,"The Hunger Games is first and foremost an adventure/survival story, and director Ross keeps things moving with nary a moment of downtime. There's precious little fat on the script; it's a lean, mean antifascist machine, and Lawrence is at once winsome and spectacularly engaging as Katniss (so much so that all her male costars pale into near-blandness in comparison)."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"Ross manages to keep the pacing remarkably swift, given that the games themselves don't start until halfway through the 144-minute running time."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"The Hunger Games' pacing is brisk, its stakes as high as stakes get, and its leading lady engaging enough that the odds - at the box office at least - will be ever in its favor."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"The action is brisk, the acting is solid, and barring an unlikely failure at the box office, a franchise is born. Let the games begin."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"This is better than any of the ""Twilights."" It features a functioning creative imagination and lots of honest-to-goodness acting by its star, Jennifer Lawrence."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"You can imagine a better adaptation of The Hunger Games, but you can much more easily imagine a far worse one, and all in all that's not a bad outcome."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"When the goal is simply to be as faithful as possible to the material - as if a movie were a marriage, and a rights contract the vow - the best result is a skillful abridgment, one that hits all the important marks without losing anything egregious. And as abridgments go, they don't get much more skillful than this one."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"What The Hunger Games does have is a game cast, a large budget well spent, Collins on board as co-writer, and Lawrence as Katniss."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"The Hunger Games represents the best first book adaptation of any of the three series. It surpasses Christopher Columbus' ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone"" by a whisker and Catherine Hardwicke's ""Twilight"" by considerably more than that."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"An effective entertainment, and Jennifer Lawrence is strong and convincing in the central role. But the film leapfrogs obvious questions in its path, and avoids the opportunities sci-fi provides for social criticism."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"The games have begun, and so far they're pretty gripping."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,The Hunger Games is more notable for the holes it doesn't fall into than the great heights it reaches.
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,70,"Director Gary Ross' adaptation, co-scripted by Collins herself, isn't quite as crackingly paced as the novel, but it will more than satisfy existing fans of the trilogy and likely create many new ones."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,70,"Like the pacing of the novel, the film, even at almost two and a half hours, moves briskly, continuously drawing us in."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,70,"Lawrence is a tremendous talent, and she is what makes The Hunger Games ultimately worth spending time with. She doesn't elevate the film to the heights to which one might have wanted, but she takes it a lot higher than it would have otherwise risen."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,70,"As she did in her breakthrough film Winter's Bone, Jennifer Lawrence anchors this futuristic and politicized elaboration of The Most Dangerous Game with impressive gravity and presence, while director Gary Ross gets enough of what matters in the book up on the screen to satisfy its legions of fans worldwide."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,63,"The Hunger Games is dressed as a dark satire of soulless entertainment, but like Katniss' adversaries in the PG-13 hunting scenes, it doesn't have a distinctive identity or go-for-the-throat."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,63,It also smells very much like a movie with money on its mind - not altogether successfully balancing its loftier ideas with a sense of superficial whimsy and Vegas-meets-Wizard of Oz production design.
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,63,"Where Collins' book paid careful attention to detail, Ross pays far too little. Characters never become exhausted or desperate or gaunt; they don't even get chapped lips or broken nails."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,63,"If the series's legions of fans miss a detail here or a sub-plot there, they'll still recognize its bones and sinew, especially in Jennifer Lawrence's eagle-eyed heroine Katniss Everdeen."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,63,"This futuristic tale of teenage violence is so not my kind of movie that I approached it grudgingly, so imagine my surprise when I ended up being totally exhilarated and enjoying it immensely."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,63,"The Hunger Games may be derivative, but it is engrossing and at times exciting. Implicitly, it argues that ""The Truman Show"" might have been improved by Ed Harris lobbing fireballs at Jim Carrey, and it's now clear what ""American Idol"" was missing all those years: a crossbow for Simon Cowell."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,60,"This is a solid take on the material, but it could have done with a little less narrative incident and a little more cinematic sparkle."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,60,"Again and again Katniss rescues herself with resourcefulness, guts and true aim, a combination that makes her insistently watchable, despite Mr. Ross's soft touch and Ms. Lawrence's bland performance."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,60,Director Gary Ross (Pleasantville) generally avoids the elaborate exterior shots and special effects that dominate high-concept blockbusters.
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,60,A watchable enough picture that feels content to realize someone else's vision rather than claim it as its own. Any real sense of risk has been carefully ironed out: The PG-13 rating that ensures the film's suitability for its target audience also blunts the impact of the teen-on-teen bloodshed.
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,50,"Watching The Hunger Games, I was struck both by how slickly Ross hit his marks and how many opportunities he was missing to take the film to the next level - to make it more shocking, lyrical, crazy, daring."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,50,"Can The Hunger Games, in the movie version directed by Gary Ross, successfully navigate the crossing from page to screen? Our answer: Eh."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,50,The Hunger Games takes no risks.
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,40,"The Hunger Games has some cool moments here and there, and is never entirely dreadful. Lawrence is both radiant and triumphant. They haven't screwed it up badly enough to kill it, although they've tried."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,30,"The result is an evasive, baffling, unexciting production - anything but a classic."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,30,"In The Hunger Games it's both a feast of cheesy spectacle and a famine of genuine feeling, except for the powerful - and touchingly vulnerable - presence of Jennifer Lawrence."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,88,"In the end, the filmmakers have given us one of the most fun movie-going experiences I’ve had this year. Huge kudos go to Johnson, Hart and especially Black for providing some truly entertaining performances for kids of all ages."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,80,"Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle is both a fulfilling reinvention and adventurous video game quest that’s far funnier, and unexpectedly exciting, than you could hope for from an evolved reboot with explosive fantasy character."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,80,"It’s an entertaining, engaging, colourful picture in its own right with decently-handled action-adventure set-pieces and sly comedy, detouring from the expected thrills and spills into body-hopping comedy drama."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,78,Kasdan injects this all with vigor and breezy humor.
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,75,"It’s the characters, not the convoluted plot or digital magic, that make “Welcome to the Jungle” such fun. For a high-concept Hollywood special-effects movie, that’s quite a concept indeed."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,75,"This is a likable, funny diversion, and sometimes more than that."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,75,The real fun of “Jumanji” lies in the casting. The towering Johnson and scrappy Hart play especially well off each other.
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,75,"A tremendous improvement over the tepid 1995 original, this quasi-sequel brings humor, fun performances, and a canny understanding of late 1990s-style video games to a party that never takes itself seriously."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,75,"The film’s best moments show the characters bonding as teens, “Breakfast Club”-style, within their new bodies."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,75,"The group’s thematically, comedically broad inversion of the source material is consistently entertaining, and squeezes in some nicely played character growth to boot."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,75,"The Jumanji reboot Welcome to the Jungle is a happy surprise — a movie that turns out to be good (almost clean) fun, and is much more interested in character and comedy than special effects."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,75,"Jumanji: Welcome to The Jungle is the Christmas tentpole release that aims to please and succeeds, a funny family entertainment product that subverts more expectations than it was obligated to contractually."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,70,"The movie has amusingly broad performances; good, bloodless scares (the characters die horribly — but have multiple lives); and self-empowering life lessons too bland to be specious. You could do far worse."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,70,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle has a pleasant, affable spirit, and Johnson is wholly charming."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,70,"This sequel turns out to be a comedy of manners, of all things, and an agreeable one, a movie that will get you laughing and suck you in."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,70,The film's main appeal is in watching familiar actors pretend to be ordinary kids grappling with their new selves.
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,70,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle brings audiences back to its classic fictional world with a fun, updated new twist on its well-worn story. So even if some of its subplots and emotional throughlines don’t quite click, the action-packed fun and humor should still make it worth your price of admission."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,67,The Jumanji sequel nobody demanded is fun. Kind of. Sort of. It’s a close call.
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,67,"Fast-paced, frequently funny, and consistently entertaining."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,65,"Give Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle credit for not wholly insulting the audience’s intelligence. The entire script is centered on these cliches embracing their cliché new bodies, cocooning stereotypes inside stereotypes like nesting dolls."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,65,"The film strikes a nice balance between serviceable, not-overly-slick action scenes—we’ve come a long way from those shoddily animated monkeys—and comedy that’s actually rooted in character, rather than cheap references or stereotypes."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,63,Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is reasonably clever and reasonably diverting.
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,63,"Black is expectedly hilarious, but the beauty part of his performance is that, instead of exaggerating or patronizing this Instagram princess, he finds her vulnerable heart."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,60,"Welcome to the Jungle is mostly great fun, with Jack Black outrageously entertaining as a teenage girl. But we need to talk about Karen. As Ruby Roundhouse, Gillan is stuck in less clothes than one of Rihanna’s backing dancers. It’s a dig at the hypersexualization of women in video games, apparently. If so, perhaps the male director (or one of the four male writers) can explain how fixing the camera on a skimpily dressed female character makes the point."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,60,"In its present form – hyperactive, dopey, and hammered into shape like a Hollywood sitcom – it’s a passable school holiday jaunt."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,60,"One of the most pleasant surprises of this year's jam-packed holiday release schedule, and easily the season's must-see family film."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,60,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a one-joke movie, relying on the subversion of physical stereotypes, but thanks to impeccable casting and fun performances, that joke is very well-executed."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,60,"It’s a likeable film which borrows liberally from everything and everyone, and if it’s put together by numbers, well, then it is done capably enough."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,58,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is, at once, invigorated and underdeveloped, both rousing and slightly underwhelming."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,58,"The adventure rides on the charisma of the ensemble, who milk the body-switching situation for all it is worth."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,50,"In the original Jumanji, young characters are caught inside a board game come to life; in the new sequel, it's a video game they adventure within – a rigid construct of one-note humour, special-effect shenanigans, relentless quest-based action and sledge-hammered messaging."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,50,"The performances by Mr. Johnson, Mr. Hart and Mr. Black seem informed by the conviction that if they amuse themselves, they will also amuse others. They are not entirely wrong, but they are also not sufficiently right."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,50,"With its video game upgrade, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle manages to match the silly fun of its predecessor — even without Williams — and that’s no small achievement unlocked."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,50,"Welcome to the Jungle isn’t a bad movie. It’s a diverting, mildly amusing, competent bit of big-budget studio product. And maybe those are the stakes we’re now playing for these days."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,50,"The mildly amusing Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is further proof that even the stalest whiff of brand recognition has become preferable to originality. Only part of the blame for that belongs to the studios, but after cannibalizing themselves for much of the last 20 years, Hollywood has clearly eaten their way down to the crumbs."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,45,"Kasdan isn’t known for pulling off big budget action properties. He does his best here to create a kinetic pace, but the execution is always flat and dull."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,42,"If you’re willing to lean into the movie’s complete and utter stupidity, Jumanji might just stumble through its languorous two-hour runtime on sheer charm."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,40,"It’s a lazy, thoroughly unoriginal bit of storytelling, but it has just enough cheeky humor and bass-thumping action scenes to be a potential crowd-pleaser."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,40,"The material is often weak, but the stars earn their paychecks."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,40,"The action’s passable and Gillan makes a decent fist of an underwritten character. Otherwise, this Jumanji makeover’s a losing game."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,38,"The whole affair feels corporate, cooked-up-by-committee."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,38,The film is unable to reconcile a desire to ridicule its own artifice with constant attempts to foster genuine empathy and dramatic tension.
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,30,"It’s like watching the lamest Indiana Jones sequel ever imagined, minus Indiana Jones."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,404515480,25,"Who’s the audience for this movie? It’s not smart, scary or funny enough for adults and older teens, and it’s inappropriate for young kids."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,100,"The new film is more expansive, more beautiful, funnier, nuttier and — this is the most difficult trick for any comic-book movie to pull off — more touching than the first film."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,91,"It’s the rare Marvel sequel that manages to expand on what came before in new and rewarding ways, while also striking its own distinct tone even as some of its narrative devices skew familiar."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,91,"How many times have you read that it’s really hard to duplicate the success of the first film in a sequel? Probably more than you can remember. Well, here’s a newsflash: Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 pulls that feat off with only a little strain and a belly of genuine emotion."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,88,"While Marvel metastasizes as a movie brand, the irreverent Guardians of the Galaxy franchise has become a healthy off-shoot. There’s something loose-limbed and unexpected about this series."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,88,"Pratt is engagingly rascally as Quill, and Saldana brings a sassy charisma to the no-nonsense Gamora. But as might be expected, Baby Groot steals the film."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,88,"Just like the first one, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a winning and wonderfully relatable gem of crazy."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,86,"By the end of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the audience is unlikely to feel they’ve seen anything that different from Vol. 1, but it’s clear that Gunn and company knew exactly what qualities made the first film so enjoyable, and what they needed to do to make sure this particular sequel was worth the wait."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,80,"Its unthwartable tempo of quips, gags, cameos (Sly Stallone!), and loud noises rarely feels grating if only because of how loving it feels toward its characters and soundtrack, and how respectful it is toward the limits of its audience’s appetite for superheroic universe-building."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,80,Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is the deranged Marvel disco you’d expect from a filmmaker who wants to push the limits of an otherwise rigid and structured system.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,80,"Underneath Vol. 2’s sarcastic exterior, Gunn’s script has a big, bleeding heart, pinpointing the characters’ insecurities and emotional scars."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,80,"The Guardians get a welcome return to the big screen, which despite many positives, fails to match the dizzying heights of the original."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,80,That sense of gooey euphoria runs through everything that’s good in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,80,"Even when the pixels threaten to overwhelm, Gunn finds refuge in his main characters. There’s plenty to enjoy here."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,"If it’s overstuffed in the way of most sequels, well, at least it’s stuffed with good cheer."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,"Volume 2 can claim to be bigger and better than its predecessor, although it still suffers from some of the narrative sleight-of-hand issues that kept Guardians of Galaxy from achieving greatness."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,"It’s a sci-fi action movie that spoofs the form to strong comic effect, and yet it profits from every good thing about the genre it’s mocking. It tries to have it both ways, and it succeeds."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,"To some degree, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is a more offbeat film than the original, with better gags, better (and more cartoonish) action, and more visual variety."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,The film at one point offers the finest sustained act of emotional storytelling to grace a Marvel Studios production.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,"“Vol. 2” avoids many of the flaws of the first movie, and does several things notably better. It’s fun, clever and a great kick-off to the summer movie season."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,"Like many a sequel to a slam-bang, much-liked mega-hit, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 isn’t quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not quite as fresh as the original — but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,Hanging with Quill and his mercenary space misfits is still everything you'd want in a wild summer ride.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,"There is wit and there are explosions, and while none of them represent a step above “Guardians of the Galaxy,” neither do they impugn the memory of one of the freshest and most fun of the Marvel movies."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,70,"It’s the classic example of the sequel to a really imaginative original: If the first one didn’t exist, this one would seem revolutionary. But the first one does, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, for all its charms, will live in its shadow."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,70,"The characters and their relationships are strong and the dialogue is sharp, but the whole thing feels like a minor installment in an ongoing series."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,70,"Shot for shot, line and line, it’s an extravagant and witty follow-up, made with the same friendly virtuosic dazzle. Yet this time you can sense just how hard the series’ wizard of a director, James Gunn (now taking off from a script he wrote solo), is working to entertain you. Maybe a little too hard."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,67,"Director and writer Gunn is a dab hand with space opera quippery and most of the set-pieces land bang on target, with collateral emotional damage to boot."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,67,James Gunn's second spin with Marvel's interplanetary misfits still entertains but this time the fun feels forced. Gone is the original's scrappy underdog spirit and a director operating like it's his only chance to make a movie.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,67,"It’s smarter than most films, but not as smart as the first one. It’s funnier than most films, but not as funny as the first one. And it still probably belongs in the upper tier of Marvel movies but nowhere near as high up as the first one."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,67,Much of the material gets rehashed with slight variations...and many of the space battles have a redundant quality.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,65,"Thankfully, Vol. 2 does come together in the end with a powerful emotional payoff, but that’s only after it becomes a computer-generated action-fest with the fate of the universe hanging in the balance again."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,63,"The sharp comic timing and devil-may-care breeziness of the original only return intermittently, and the new film’s emphasis is on family feuds and forgiveness. It’s heavy on the feels. There are hugs."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,63,"What flipped by as a funny, big-budget whimsy before takes on gravitas — daddy issues, intimacy issues, trust issues."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,63,This one's a step down from the original.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,"Gunn decides to treat the quest for meaning seriously — a lethal move that not only leads to the noisy palaver of the climax but also undermines Chris Pratt, who likes to hold these movies at arm’s length, as it were, and to probe them for pomposity."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,"It’s tough being a hitmaker who isn’t weighed down by corporate expectations, but for a while, Mr. Gunn does a pretty good job of keeping the whole thing reasonably fizzy, starting with an opener that winks at the audience with big bangs and slapstick."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 probably couldn’t, and definitely doesn’t, recapture the sweet and singular silliness of the original, though the new edition from Marvel Studios and Disney has its rewards."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,"As a result of trying too hard to maintain the original's insouciant attitude, what was fresh now seems institutionalized, what was off the wall now feels carved in stone and the film's trademark irreverence has become dogma."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,"The second ""volume"" of the open-ended franchise is simply not as charming as the original."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,"The choice soundtrack, accompanied by the candyfloss aesthetic make for moments of fun, but it ultimately lacks the originality of the first."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,"The characters are still fun to be around, the one-liners are still sharp...and the soundtrack is, of course, terrific. But there are only so many times you can slap on a Fleetwood Mac toe-tapper and expect it to paper over the cracks."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 plays like a second ride on a roller-coaster that was a real kick the first time around but feels very been-there/done-that now.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,"It’s fun, though GOTG2 doesn’t have the same sense of weird urgency and point that the first film had. They’re still guarding, although the galaxy never seems in much danger."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,50,"The sequel is often loud, occasionally obnoxious and so consistently convinced of its own awesomeness that it will not, it cannot, stop pointing out everything that makes it so utterly wonderful."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,50,"Gunn maintains the unenviable job of giving each piece of his ensemble their due screen time to avoid making it the Peter Quill show, but the proceedings often feel manic, disjointed, and overstuffed."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,50,Vol. 2 aims to please with breathtaking set pieces that’ll convince you to delete all your old diatribes about CGI ruining the movies. But no matter how funny writer-director James Gunn wants this film to be — the one-liners move at lightspeed — too many of the punch lines are referential.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,50,It’s not the weighty emotions that drag Vol. 2 down. It’s the plot that chases its own tail and the cluttered visual palette.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,50,"In striving to surprise us every minute with its seen-it-all irony, Guardians Vol. 2 is actually the surprise-spoiler of all time—our every “Wow!” or “Haha!” has been scripted in advance."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,38,It’s a rare misstep for the usually sure-footed folks behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Deadpool,8,363070709,88,It’s impossible to envision a sequel with pleasure – this kind of lightning wouldn’t strike twice – but the first one could hardly be improved.
Deadpool,8,363070709,88,"Compared to Deadpool, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a bastion of sobriety and good taste."
Deadpool,8,363070709,88,"Smart, sexy and outrageous, Deadpool delivers."
Deadpool,8,363070709,88,"It’s a voraciously self-aware comedy, one that dines out on the inherent inanity of its own premise as much as it does the movies it’s competing with."
Deadpool,8,363070709,88,"Deadpool is one of those movies that’s all the more successful for how easily it could have gone so very wrong. It’s suffused with an arch, self-aware wit...yet it takes its romance and revenge storylines just seriously enough to keep us engaged."
Deadpool,8,363070709,83,"It is almost preposterous how little ""plot"" there is in the film...What it has in spades is attitude, and right up until the moment the film began, I was afraid It was going to be so juvenile and filthy that I would end up annoyed by it. Instead, from the very beginning of the opening credits, it is clear that director Tim Miller and screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick have crafted something deeply silly that isn't remotely interested in playing by the conventional rules of what we've come to think of as ""the superhero genre."""
Deadpool,8,363070709,80,"It takes a strong stomach for extreme violence and over-the-top obscenity, but if you're willing to roll with that, Deadpool is a hoot."
Deadpool,8,363070709,80,"What sets Deadpool apart is its overall genre-busting tone, which blends a wealth of meta humor, the wisecracking Reynolds' significant skills with a one-liner, and a genuinely funny script that isn't afraid to offend anyone."
Deadpool,8,363070709,80,Deadpool is neurotic and needy – and very entertaining. An innocent pleasure.
Deadpool,8,363070709,80,"Loud, lewd, inventive and outrageous, Deadpool is a delight. All credit to Reynolds and co. for having the steel balls to go this far."
Deadpool,8,363070709,80,"It takes a little while to get in gear — or perhaps just to adjust to what's going on here — but once it does, Deadpool drops trou to reveal itself as a really raunchy, very dirty and pretty funny goof on the entire superhero ethos, as well as the first Marvel film to irreverently trash the brand."
Deadpool,8,363070709,80,"As a vehicle for the impudent comic stylings of Ryan Reynolds, this cheerfully demented origin story is many, many cuts above “Green Lantern,” and as a sly demolition job on the superhero movie, it sure as hell beats “Kick-Ass.”"
Deadpool,8,363070709,78,"Loaded with sass, sex, and sadistic violence, Deadpool is not your youngster’s comic-book origin story. Deadpool earns every bit of its R rating, a quality that’s sure to appeal to fans weary of the macho, apple-pie-eating, altruistic superheroes who buck for attention in the comic-book stables."
Deadpool,8,363070709,75,"It's also violent to point of sadism, explicit both visually and in terms of language. A potty-mouthed splatterfest, in fact — but a funny one."
Deadpool,8,363070709,75,"This movie's junky feel is part of its charm. Sure it goes on too long and repetition dulls its initial cleverness. Still, Deadpool is party time for action junkies and Reynolds may just have found the role that makes his career."
Deadpool,8,363070709,75,First-time feature director Tim Miller has created a work that’s both aggressive and not aggressive enough.
Deadpool,8,363070709,75,"Deadpool is, on the whole, a big bowl of fun filled with great stunts, gory fight scenes, and sexy poses."
Deadpool,8,363070709,75,"They even make the requisite cameo by Marvel founding father Stan Lee feel profanely inspired. Not your usual Marvel superhero scene? In this case, that’s a good thing."
Deadpool,8,363070709,75,"Maximally cheeky. Perversely potty-mouthed. Riotously funny. Insanely violent. Uneven as all get out. And fun, fun, fun."
Deadpool,8,363070709,75,"Deadpool's flawed insolence is appealing, like a mangy pup crawling into your lap."
Deadpool,8,363070709,75,There are more funny lines and opening credit sight gags in this than most comedies have in their full running time.
Deadpool,8,363070709,75,"It doesn’t have the most adrenalized action sequences or the deepest origin story. What it has is the balls to mess with the formula and have some naughty, hard-R fun. It’s a superhero film for the wiseasses shooting spitballs in the back of the school bus."
Deadpool,8,363070709,72,"This humor could be profoundly ugly, given how it's aimed at reducing other people's grotesque deaths to punchlines. But first-time director Tim Miller keeps the tone light — in his hands, Deadpool is more a snickering, naughty nut than an authentic sociopath."
Deadpool,8,363070709,70,"Deadpool is a send-up of Marvel movies but in no way a takedown of them. It’s not subversive — it’s meant to elasticize and enhance the superhero genre, to flatter the audience for being hip enough to get all of those in-jokes."
Deadpool,8,363070709,70,"It’s no surprise that the teams hired to bring a property like Deadpool to the screen know how to keep the machine oiled and humming; it’s the ones who somehow manage to temporarily stick a wrench in the works, adding something human — a feeling instead of another quip — who are worth your attention."
Deadpool,8,363070709,70,Deadpool might even stand as one of the strongest and most inventive films of the high-early-late superhero baroque — if we could just turn off its built-in commentary track.
Deadpool,8,363070709,70,"More often than not, Deadpool’s bratty energy feels liberating, allowing for a sexier, dirtier, more hilarious superhero movie than the typical all-ages Marvel affair, which is so concerned with maximising profits that it risks offending no one."
Deadpool,8,363070709,67,"The eccentric touches—a Wham! musical cue, a dash of screwball body horror—are just accents on a stealth franchise extension. At a certain point, you have to do more than just recognize and point out the mold. You have to actually shatter it."
Deadpool,8,363070709,67,"As is often the case with such violence, it eventually becomes numbing. By its midpoint, once the novelty of a superhero movie showing super levels of violence wears off, the thinness and lack of spark in the fight scenes becomes more readily apparent. By the film's end, they are hard to distinguish from any other superhero fare. Similarly, lack of imagination keep the film's prodigious swearing and occasional nudity from feeling like anything original."
Deadpool,8,363070709,63,"For grown-ups, however, Deadpool avoids enough pitfalls to both embrace and flambé the superhero genre while also finding time for romance, doling out equal handfuls of bullets, barbs and warm fuzzies."
Deadpool,8,363070709,63,The movie's far from dull. But first-time feature director Tim Miller's film serves as critique as well an example of what ails the superhero movie industry.
Deadpool,8,363070709,63,"If only Deadpool were as clever, dark and funny as it believes itself to be."
Deadpool,8,363070709,63,The whiplash contrasts between snideness and sincerity is deeply rooted in the main character's psychology.
Deadpool,8,363070709,60,"The ambition is laudable, but Tim Miller’s movie, far from seeming reckless and loose-limbed, comes across as pathologically calculated, measuring out its nastiness to the last drop."
Deadpool,8,363070709,60,"You're initially jazzed by his effrontery, but Deadpool, with his relentlessly glib, nothing-sacred attitude, is not an individual who wears particularly well."
Deadpool,8,363070709,60,It's buckshot humor that is funny when it lands; cringe-worthy when it doesn't.
Deadpool,8,363070709,60,"For a film that vocally questions convention, it's perhaps a shame that Miller and co. played it so safe with a fairly cookie-cutter origin story, but it's really just there to give Reynolds ammunition to riff on. Whether the studio might be willing to push the character further into the leftfield in the future will depend on whether Deadpool warrants sequels."
Deadpool,8,363070709,60,"The sheer number of dick jokes will soon numb you to their impact, but this is a fun, if patchy, alternative to the glut of ‘the world is about to end unless we do something’ comic-book films."
Deadpool,8,363070709,60,"The fourth-wall-smashing is fun in a Ferris Bueller kind of way, but it’s never pulled off with the devious panache of Blazing Saddles, let alone Funny Games or Hellzapoppin’. Since it's this stuff, rather than the ongoing thud-thud-thud of bad language and gore, that feels mould-breaking, it’s a pity Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick’s screenplay doesn’t have the courage to experiment a little more."
Deadpool,8,363070709,58,It seems less irreverent than self-congratulatory.
Deadpool,8,363070709,50,"Deadpool, intended as a spiky antidote to superhero oversaturation, ends up impaling only itself."
Deadpool,8,363070709,50,It’s hard to imagine a movie much more aware of itself both as a movie and as a moment in a cultural progression of similar movies than Deadpool.
Deadpool,8,363070709,50,"It’s a remarkably straightforward origin flick, lacking in true satire of its genre, carried almost entirely by its lead. Deadpool is a fun character, but he’s still in search of a fun movie to match his larger-than-life personality."
Deadpool,8,363070709,50,"It’s a film that desperately wants to upend the tropes of the comic book movie, but perhaps more shocking than anything that comes out of the mouth of its often obnoxious titular hero, is how blandly the picture sticks to the origin story playbook."
Deadpool,8,363070709,40,"Bloody, shallow and oh-so-smug, Deadpool is so eager to offend that it’d almost be sweet if it wasn’t so, well, relentlessly annoying."
Deadpool,8,363070709,40,"While Deadpool’s core audience will appreciate the way it flatters their knowledge of genre conventions with winking, cynical humor, too much of this stuff just plays like smug self-satisfaction. The movie is so impressed with itself that the viewer’s satisfaction seems completely irrelevant."
Deadpool,8,363070709,38,"This one is a “different kind of superhero movie,” meaning even more fiercely attached to the mode of artistic expression known as “puberty.”"
Deadpool,8,363070709,25,"This is bad, borderline garbage, but disturbing, too, in that it’s just the kind of fake-clever awfulness that might be cinema’s future."
Deadpool,8,363070709,25,"For an 11-year-old sneaking into the theater for his first R-rated movie, Deadpool could prove to be a revelatory trip. For myself, it was an exhausting, grating experience, lacking in wit and cleverness as it crumbles underneath its wall-to-wall torrent of jokes. If this represents a new stage for comic-book adaptations, the future is even more dismal than one could have imagined."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,100,"Furious 7 is so entertaining that you don't notice Dwayne Johnson is missing from action much of the time, only that he kills it when he shows up."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,91,"Plot is unimportant. Family is everything, and Furious 7 is a blast."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,90,"It’s an enormous, steroidal blast, and as much ingenious fun as a blockbuster can be."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,90,"For all the full-throttle dazzle of Furious 7, the best scenes are the quietest ones, in which these characters make observations about love, life, and family that would seem overcooked in any other movie."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,88,"Like Lee Daniels' hit TV drama “Empire,” Furious 7 is stuffed with situations that require go-for-broke absurdity, but even Daniels and his nighttime soap predecessor Aaron Spelling would pause before attempting the level of “get the f—k outta here!” style shenanigans director James Wan and writer Chris Morgan employ."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,88,"Furious 7 is the best F&F by far, two hours of pure pow fueled by dedication and passionate heart."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,83,"Furious 7 is at turns a celebration and a farewell, a film that goes for broke in using its many seemingly forgettable bits of established canon to tie together all of the films and pay its respects."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,83,"The series will doubtless continue on with Diesel, Rodriguez, Johnson, and the rest, but in the meantime, Furious 7 comes to the most conclusive and emotionally satisfying ending since, fittingly, the very first film."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,80,"Furious 7 is an in-your-face assault of awesomeness under the guidance of James Wan, who saves a more lax story by orchestrating a metallic ballet of kick-ass proportions."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,80,What makes Furious 7 a serious contender for the title of Fast franchise highlight—challenged only by 2011’s Fast Five and its unmatched vault-heist sequence—is the way it embraces the series’ most basic pleasures while amplifying everything tenfold.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,80,"Furious 7 is the fuel-injected fusion of all that is and ever has been good in ""The Fast and the Furious"" saga."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,80,"Furious 7 never even pretends to be a stand-alone movie. This is a fan event through and through, filled with references, inside jokes and a loyalty to continuity that may baffle newcomers."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,80,"If incoming director James Wan (“The Conjuring,” “Saw”) falls the tiniest bit short of what Justin Lin brought to the third, fifth and sixth entries, Furious 7 nonetheless ranks a very successful fourth place overall, with at least one gargantuan set piece that ranks among the series’ finest."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,80,"A group more bulletproof than The Avengers, causing more mayhem than General Zod. Think Universal doesn’t have a superhero franchise? Think again."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,80,Wan has fashioned a nitro-fuelled thrill-ride that forms a fitting tribute to its blue-eyed bro.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,"Having, presumably, run out of surfaces on the ground, the mad driving crew of Furious 7 resort to backing their cars off a plane and clutching their steering wheels while driving, er, falling through thin air. Why do they do this? Because it’s fun … to watch, that is."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,"It's all dumb, but it's wonderfully, comfortably dumb in just the right way."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,"Finally, a movie with at least some coherence despite its sadly challenging circumstances."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,"Viewers who come for the spectacle will get their money's worth. Furious Seven is all about action, with some scenes being more inventive than others."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,"It's roughly as realistic as Georges Melies' ""A Trip to the Moon,"" of course. But revisiting our old pals (one of whom is played by an actor who is no longer with us) and watching them survive one unsurvivable collision or plunge after another, continues against the odds to have a walloping charm all its own."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,No one forks over 10 bucks to see one of these flicks for its logic. We go for the bananas demolition-derby mayhem. Furious 7 delivers that with the direct visceral rush of an EpiPen.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,"Furious 7 offers edge-of-the-seat excitement with outlandish action sequences, inventive stunts, hilarious cartoonish moments and even some touching emotion."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,"This is one of the most ridiculous thrillers I’ve ever seen, and yet even with a running time that stretched well beyond two hours, with so many repetitive moments I almost began to wonder if I had missed something and the movie had started again, I have to admit I was entertained by the sheer audacity of the car chases and battle sequences — and there were even some genuinely touching moments."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,"The film lays bare that the franchise's most radical asset is also its most conservative: an overriding emphasis on, above all else, the on-screen family."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,70,"Even though Walker is still present, his absence is already felt. It is strange to watch a movie that is this much fun and this sad all at the same time."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,70,"The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie’s real subject is the stunt work, but its stars’ authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,70,"Furious 7 kicks the biggest and hardest, but it’s far from the best. Lin has handed the keys to James Wan, the cunning horror director of ""Saw"" and ""The Conjuring,"" and though the thrill isn’t gone, the finesse is."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,70,"There will no doubt be better movies released in 2015, but Furious 7 is an early favorite to win the prize for most picture."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,70,"It’s joyous, it’s crazy – cars skydive out of aircraft in Azerbaijan, no less  - it’s exhaustively long, and, still, it’s clunkily lovable."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,70,"Furious 7 provides both a satisfying chapter in the movies’ preeminent gearhead soap opera and a tactful, touching memorial to Walker."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,67,"Furious 7 is, to put it succinctly, a rush and a half."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,63,"Yes, the whole movie feels overstuffed and overlong, and the non-action scenes are often dragged down by stilted dialogue. But Furious 7 buzzes with a frenetic energy so contagious, there’s no sense in resisting it."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,60,"While it can feel, at times, a little too scattered (often in terms of plot), this is a praiseworthy venture. Its a film that knows its audience well enough to give them exactly what they demand and deserve after more than a decade of dedication."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,60,"In the wake of Walker’s death, it constitutes a farewell of fitting elegance."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,60,"Furious 7, formulaic or not, knows exactly what kind of movie it is. It is a superhero movie without the tights. It is a comic-book franchise without the radioactive spider bite. It is, plain and simple, an automotive ""Avengers."""
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,60,"The sheer sense of ludicrous, punch-the-air joie de vivre is impossibly infectious."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,60,There’s something about the franchise’s earnest investment in its characters that’s quite unique. Its longevity is because it functions as much as a soap as an action flick.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,60,"I’ve always enjoyed the idea of the Fast & Furious films more than their execution, but this feels like the series’ strongest, even though some of its action sequences are so muddled they can barely walk straight."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,60,A film that (whatever massive efforts were required to work around [Paul Walker's] absence) is as stupendously stupid and stupidly diverting as it could have hoped to be had everything gone as planned.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,58,The only grace note in this otherwise determinedly graceless movie is the classy way Walker’s exit is handled.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,58,"There's too much head-butting between human battering rams Diesel and Jason Statham, too many noisy explosions and generic special effects, and not enough car races and chases."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,58,"Cacophonous, gratuitous, and peppered with absolutely outstanding action sequences, Furious 7 finds the franchise at an unwanted crossroads, but it makes such a play for the diehard fans that it leaves everyone else at somewhat of a loss."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,50,There’s so much happening that the whole gets boring for long stretches throughout.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,50,"The reflection offered in the puckered muscle and polished chrome of Furious 7’s heroes feels like a cheery escapist distortion of a culture that more closely resembles the smashed steel, mangled bone and blood and vomit of a plain ol’ unsexy car wreck."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,50,"If you don’t crave the taste of motor oil on your popcorn, Furious 7 can’t end fast enough."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,50,"Here is a film in which nothing is at stake: Cars crash into each other head-on at high speeds, vehicles sail off cliffs and tumble down rocky mountainsides, people jump out of buildings and fall six stories to the ground, then characters just dust themselves off and continue as if nothing had happened. Even Wile E. Coyote wasn't  this resilient."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,50,"Despite James Wan’s capable direction and very game cast, the whole thing goes increasingly wobbly like a bad axle, until it’s just a tangle of metal and bullets and yelling."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,38,The fun is in shorter supply. And all these gear-jamming chases and wince-inducing explosions cannot hide that this ride has long been on a road to nowhere.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,30,"If you like a little bit more in a movie — say, characters that are mildly interesting or a plot that's a wee bit logical — stay far away."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,25,"The action comes so fast and furious in Furious 7 that, for all the explosions and overturned cars and missiles fired on downtown Los Angeles, it becomes a dull muddle. Here and there, we get the imaginative and outrageous stunts this series is famous for, but mostly the movie plods along, muscling through without much life or spirit."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,100,"It shows Eastwood, at 84, in his finest directorial effort since the 2008 ""Gran Torino,"" while painting on a much broader canvas. Utterly in command of his epic material, he films the Iraqi action in terse, tense panoramas with little cinematic editorializing, as if he were an old Greek or Hebrew God who is never surprised at man’s ability to kill his fellow men, or to find reasons to do so. Directing 34 films over 44 years, Eastwood has honed his craft to its essentials: make it seem as if the story is telling itself."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,100,"The moral alertness of the film is of the level normally confined, in military pictures, to talky courtroom scenes, yet Eastwood skillfully works dilemmas into propulsive and suspenseful action."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,91,"Unlike many post 9/11 war movies, American Sniper goes easier on the gung ho, with a third act leavened by Chris' depressed denial, his ""hurt locker"" of stored regret. Eastwood is less concerned with action heroism than the consequences of deadly action, how it chips away at the living."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,90,"Finding words for the starring performance is easy. After breaking through as a brilliant comic actor in “The Hangover,” “Silver Linings Playbook” and “American Hustle,” Mr. Cooper turns out to be just as brilliant at intensely dramatic inwardness. In his extraordinarily austere portrayal, Kyle’s silences are eloquent, his impassivity interesting, his inner conflicts implied without a trace of sentimentality."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,90,"American Sniper is at its best when it deals with the assembly-line-of-death relentlessness of combat for Kyle, how it simultaneously consumes him and wears him down, and how, to his wife's distress, it turns the civilian life he returns to between tours of duty into the aberration, not the norm."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,88,"American Sniper isn’t some flag-waving political movie. It’s a powerful, intense portrayal of a man who was hardly the blueprint candidate to become the most prolific sniper in American military history. And yet that’s what happened."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,88,"American Sniper may be the hardest, truest movie ever made about the experience of men in war. Why? Because there’s no glory in it."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,88,One of the more tough-minded and effective war pictures of post-American-Century American cinema.
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,88,"Eastwood, working from a script that Jason Hall adapted from Kyle's 2012 memoir, fuses the explosive and the sorrowful as only he can. That's why his film takes a piece out of you."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,88,"The movie not only represents the best effort from Eastwood since his Oscar-winning ""Million Dollar Baby"" but the finest acting we have seen thus far from two-time nominee Bradley Cooper."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,88,"Clint Eastwood startlingly grips the audience with his sense of hypnotic silence, which carries suggestions of what might be termed politically apolitical pragmatism."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,83,"Eastwood has directed five war movies and acted in others, and he knows there’s no single truth to convey about combat."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,"What we're left with is something sobering but searing, muscular but compassionate."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,"It's Cooper's movie, and, although he has been good in pretty much everything we've seen him in, there is a depth to this performance we haven't seen before. It's a tricky balance: As the legend grows, the man diminishes. Cooper and Eastwood do an exceptionally good job of maintaining that."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,"Cooper’s performance grounds a solid, authentic drama – Eastwood’s best since Letters From Iwo Jima – that is less about one single field of combat than the price of war itself."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,"Oscar heralds will no doubt dub it ""The Hurt Locker"" for snipers, but the fitting combo of Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper have created a thrilling Iraq war story that manages to both honour the necessities of heroism and ruminate on what heroism might cost a man."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,American Sniper is a superbly subtle critique made by an especially young 84-year-old.
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,"The best movies are ever-shifting, intelligent and open-hearted enough to expand alongside an audience. American Sniper, Clint Eastwood’s harrowing meditation on war, is built on this foundation of uncommon compassion."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,"Eastwood has become tauntingly tough-minded: “You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?” he seems to be saying. And, with the remorselessness of age, he follows Chris Kyle’s rehabilitation and redemption back home, all the way to their heartbreaking and inexplicable end."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,"A taut, vivid and sad account of the brief life of the most accomplished marksman in American military annals, American Sniper feels very much like a companion piece—in subject, theme and quality—to The Hurt Locker."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,"Just as “The Hurt Locker” found revelatory depths in Jeremy Renner, so American Sniper hinges on Cooper’s restrained yet deeply expressive lead performance, allowing many of the drama’s unspoken implications to be read plainly in the actor’s increasingly war-ravaged face."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"Beefed up and twanging like a true cowboy, Cooper nonetheless carries the full weight of his character's achievements - and the questions that come with them - as he tries to find his footing back on Texas soil. If American Sniper fails at being a truly great film, it is no fault of its star."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"While the movie is narrow, it has a deep, melancholic resonance."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"Eastwood and screenwriter Jason Hall have made as good a film as could be made from the substance of Kyle’s life and career. But greatness was never a possibility, not with a protagonist not all that interesting and with the surrounding circumstances making it impossible to go deeper and risk the movie’s critique of Kyle’s becoming overt."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"The battle scenes are alternately tense and thrilling, especially during one climactic sequence."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"Taking potshots at American Sniper is like shooting fish in a barrel. So why should war-weary Americans see it? Because Eastwood remains a masterful action director, and this may be his last hurrah. Because Cooper is one of our best young actors, and he poured a lifetime of craft into stilling his character’s heartbeat."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"Expertly shot and choreographed in Eastwood’s clean, unfussy style, the Iraq sequences are taut, harrowing and at times excruciatingly suspenseful, particularly a setpiece in which Kyle faces off against his Iraqi counterpart, a superb sniper who has made it his mission to take down the American sharpshooter."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"Clint Eastwood’s second film this year, American Sniper, about the late Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, is considerably better than his first, “The Jersey Boys.” As a piece of direction, it’s as taut as anything he’s ever done."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"American Sniper's wartime sequences are well-paced and harrowing, reminiscent of those in 2008's ""The Hurt Locker."" Like that film, Sniper can be interpreted either as a patriotic salute or as an incisive anti-war movie. In either case, it's a powerful, moving and tragic tale."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"American Sniper is imperfect and at times a little corny, but also ambivalent and complicated in ways that are uniquely Eastwoodian."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"Cooper, to his credit, rarely flinches, never chest-thumps and never loses his cool, even when Kyle is starting to lose his. It’s a masterful interpretation of a man with a lot more on his mind and blood on his hands than he was ever inclined to let on. And it’s a performance worthy of Eastwood himself — 50 years ago."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"Another war biopic opening on Christmas day, with tight, two-fisted direction by Clint Eastwood, and a compelling centerpiece performance by Bradley Cooper."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"Propulsive battle sequences in which sandstorms make the fog of war quite literal are the ostensible focus of American Sniper, but the real tension comes from our anticipation of how they'll affect the life this sharpshooter is reluctant to return to until he feels he's done everything he possibly can."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,70,"American Sniper is by no stretch a critique of the U.S. involvement in Iraq; Eastwood leaves larger questions of politics and policy entirely outside the frame of his story, an approach not uncommon in modern war films of any political stripe."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,67,"To its credit, the film shows no interest in creating blind heroics but instead uphold the nickname Kyle earned in Iraq: the Legend."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,67,Eastwood wisely trains the camera on Cooper's face and keeps it there — he knows his actor can carry the story’s emotion when other aspects fail it.
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,60,"Eastwood doesn’t care about the legend. Instead, he shows us Kyle much as he saw his targets: with that strange combination of extreme intimacy and extreme remove that a long-range sight confers."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,60,"Less a war movie than a western — the story of a lone gunslinger facing down his nemesis in a dusty, lawless place — it is blunt and effective, though also troubling."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,60,"It’s a cracker­jack piece of filmmaking, a declaration that he’s (Eastwood) not yet ready to be classified as an Old Master, that he can out-Bigelow Kathryn Bigelow. Morally, though, he has regressed from the heights of Letters From Iwo Jima (2006). In more ways than one, the Iraq occupation is seen through the sight of a high-powered rifle. The movie is scandalously blinkered."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,60,"[Clint Eastwood's] gripping, incurious film gives the impression of having not so much been directed as dictated. It stares so fixedly down the rifle sight that it is finally guilty of tunnel vision."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,58,"If the star does his utmost to make a one-dimensional character interesting, his director, Clint Eastwood, adapts Kyle's memoir — a life story rife with moral complexity — by hammering it flat."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,58,"Clint Eastwood's American Sniper is a film that evokes complicated emotions. A month after seeing it, you might still be wrestling with whether it's powerful, profound, or propaganda."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,50,"The film is rarely dull; it's one life-and-death sequence after another, and the filmmaking's efficient, crisply delivered. But Eastwood honors his subject without really getting under his skin."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,50,"A lesser filmmaker, and a lesser actor, might have made American Sniper into an unthinking bit of jingoism. Eastwood and Cooper keep finding respectful complexities in Kyle’s story, until the film reveals itself as too simple to have much use for them."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,50,"Overall, American Sniper is a solidly-staged but unexceptional picture, filled with overly familiar dramatic situations and a surprisingly blindered view of the world around its central character."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,40,"Despite a delicate handling of Kyle's internal struggles on home soil, deeper complexity appears to lie just out of frame throughout."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,40,"The humble Kyle onscreen is Kyle with his flaws written out. We're not watching a biopic. We're watching a drama about an idealized soldier, a patriot beyond reproach, which bolsters Kyle's legend while gutting the man."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,40,"Director Clint Eastwood‘s focus on Kyle is so tight that no other character, including wife Taya (Sienna Miller), comes through as a person, and the scope so narrow that the film engages only superficially with the many moral issues surrounding the Iraq War."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,91,"The film explores the way propaganda is used to set the stage for a conflict, and considering this is a mainstream franchise aimed primarily at young audiences, it's actually a pretty interesting take on how image matters as much as action in a media age."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,90,"A penultimate chapter without a real ending, but it’s also a thrilling ride full of potent emotions, new characters and major twists of fate, built around another commanding star performance."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,88,It's easily the most political of the three films. It also is the most absorbing and best in the series.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,83,"With Mock 1, the Hunger Games franchise continues to entertain and evolve, not perfectly but smartly, so we can't wait to see what's next. That's what counts when all is said, done and deposited in the bank."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,83,"Suffice it to say that while Mockingjay, Part 1 might not be as consistently thrilling as “Catching Fire” — the second movie always has the luxury of being all PB&J and no crust — it's the movie equivalent of a page-turner, consistently suspenseful and filled with surprises and illuminating character moments."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,80,"The trifecta of Lawrence, Moore, and Hoffman is the movie’s driving force, from both a plot and performance perspective. Together, they imbue Mockingjay with a sense of gravity and significance befitting its tough themes."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,80,"A part with this much sobbing, hand-wringing, and mournful gazing into the middle distance could be, in the wrong hands, a laugh riot, but Lawrence’s instincts are so smart that she never goes even a shade overboard. She’s a hell of an actress."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,80,"While it definitely takes its foot off the action, Mockingjay – Part 1 goes deeper and darker."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,80,"With measure and muscle, Lawrences Jennifer and Francis nail the job of selling the long, twisting road towards revolution."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"If Mockingjay - Part 1 is quieter and less flashy than its predecessors, that doesn't make it less satisfying."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,This installment substitutes psychological action for physical thrills.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"What's missing from Mockingjay - Part 1 is a strong through-story. The previous films were characterized by engrossing, well-constructed story arcs but Mockingjay - Part 1 meanders."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"Although it doesn’t make a lick of sense as a stand-alone story, Mockingjay — Part 1 is the first “Hunger Games” movie with meat on its bones."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"Dark, grim and exciting entertainment."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"Delivers the dazzle without sacrificing the smarts. The suspense is killer. Ditto the thrill of the hunt. The film uses the extra time to, of all things, develop characters and give this dystopian fable a human scale."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"Not everything in “Mockingjay” is dynamic or remarkable. Director Lawrence, working from Peter Craig and Danny Strong's screenplay, occasionally mistakes somnambulance for solemnity."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"Ultimately, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1 serves as solid if unspectacular first lap around the track of a two-lap race."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"As a metaphor for the way we respond to the media, and the way our politics are funneled through the media lens, the film succeeds most when it revels in ambiguity."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"It's rare to see any blockbuster in any genre make decisions informed and driven by character, rather than by the more superficial requirements of blockbuster entertainment, but the rewards in that regard are plentiful in Mockingjay."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,70,"As smart as this film is about image-making in the age of all-pervasive media, the theme threatens to wear thin until Katniss comes to a new and moving awareness of her power, not just as a figurehead fashioned and elaborately feathered by political consultants but as a source of authentic inspiration to her shattered nation."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,70,"If Mockingjay’s placeholder status is a little too evident in its choppy, shapeless structure, this dark third chapter does have stretches of somber beauty."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,70,"The script for Mockingjay Part 1, credited to Peter Craig and Danny Strong, gets the job done, but the performers matter far more than the words they deliver."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,70,Director Francis Lawrence does a nice job capturing the claustrophobic environment of District 13 and has a good eye for action shots. But the actors are what really sell the movie.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,70,"If you break the script down into plot points, it sounds a little silly: The narrative thrust is simply Katniss shooting several pro-revolution commercials. But it works because we're fascinated by media fights — thousands occur online every day."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,70,"For all its obvious smarts and mildly provocative ideas, Mockingjay doesn’t seem to trust its audience quite as much as it clearly trusts its heroine."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,67,"It’s good for business but bad for drama, and the inelegantly titled Mockingjay—Part 1 suffers from an unavoidable sense of anticlimax. It doesn’t build to an ending so much as just eventually grind to a halt, like a video game demanding more quarters to continue playing."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,67,"The biggest problem with the new Hunger Games movie is right there in the title: Part 1. Mockingjay, the final installment in Suzanne Collins' best-selling YA trilogy, wasn't conceived in two parts."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,63,"The problem is, for all its surface intelligence, ""Mockingjay, Part 1"" has little depth, and that sometimes makes it much more frustrating than a more knowingly shallow and silly movie might have been."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,63,"It’s a joyless, surpassingly dour enterprise, but one that fulfills its mission with Katniss’s own eagle-eyed efficiency and unsentimental somberness."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,60,"Though everyone tries her or his hardest to make it otherwise, this is by definition a place-holder film that exists not so much for itself but to smooth the transition from its hugely successful predecessors to a presumably glorious finale one year hence."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,60,"The drama and tone are powerful and effective and Lawrence makes an exceptionally charismatic heroine, but an almost total lack of action means this is less catching fire than treading water."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,60,"Director Francis Laurence ekes a paltry story out. The special effects are limp and the script a little creaky, although somehow it still manages to thrill."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,60,Collins' revolutionary-lite rhetoric has become unravelled by the commercially driven decision to split the final novel into two films - ultimately lessening the satirical bite and reverting to the very gender archetypes it originally sought to challenge.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,60,"Mockingjay – Part 1 is all queue, no roller-coaster. The third of four films in the successful and admirable Hunger Games series is any number of good things: intense, stylish, topical, well-acted. But the one thing it could never be called is satisfying."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,58,"The best part of ""Mockingjay -- Part 1"" is when Katniss sings ""The Hanging Tree."""
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,50,"That makes Mockingjay – Part 1 an experience to be endured, like a prison sentence, rather than enjoyed. By all means, bring on the revolution: It has to be more exciting than this."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,50,"As it is, “Mockingjay,” a big bore, suffers from being the transitional event before the big showdown."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,50,"It’s a cheat, a cash grab, and it makes for 125 dystopian minutes of set-up with no resolution. But come back next November, folks, and we’ll show you the rest! They should have called it “Mockingjay, Part 1 — The Shakedown.” Or “The Hunger Games 3: Rubble Without a Cause.”"
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,50,"The movie lumbers on some more, reiterating the obvious and relying on overfamiliar imagery. Audiences have a long year to wait for Part 2. Would it not have been better to leave them breathless than heaving a sigh?"
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,50,"It’s not a bad film, this first-half of the concluding chapter of “The Hunger Games.” But it is, from first scene to last, just a tedious good-looking set-up for what one might hope would be a more lively, and perhaps better lit and ventilated finale."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,50,"Though we still believe that Lawrence, who turned 25 in August, can do no wrong, she isn’t given much opportunity to do anything spectacularly right here. Her performance is a medley of sobs and gasps, in mournful or radiant closeup. This time, her Katniss is as much a prisoner of her circumstances as Peeta is. She and the movie are both victims of burnout."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,50,"Unfortunately, Mockingjay — Part 1 has all the personality of an industrial film. There's not a drop of insolence, insubordination or insurrection running through its veins; it feels like a manufactured product through and through, ironic and sad given its revolutionary theme."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,40,"With no real beginning and no real ending, the unsatisfying ""Mockingjay Part 1"" is essentially all middle -- one big, stretched out, watered-down second act. The result is a handsome film, but also a talky one that takes a while to hit its storytelling stride and that, once there, repeatedly stalls to fill time."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,40,"There is a serious lack of action here, which might be overlooked if the script were as smart as in the previous films. What passes for parable here is merely overplotting."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,38,Hopefully Jennifer Lawrence will actually be given something worthwhile to do next time around. That would actually be worth paying to see.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,25,"Only in the movie business could someone sell such shoddy merchandise and expect people to buy it. If The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1 were an appliance, it would be a broken toaster that people would toss in the garbage. Except that analogy is too kind, in that “Mockingjay” would be half a toaster."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,88,Aquaman is as concerned with scientific accuracy as “SpongeBob Squarepants.” And that’s one of many reasons why I like it.
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,85,It’s a weird and wonderful superhero adventure that strives — and almost succeeds — to be the most epic superhero movie ever made.
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,80,"In its best moments, Aquaman is transportive. There are worse ways to spend a Saturday afternoon."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,80,"Aquaman is worth seeing if only for its original visuals and the grand vision from director James Wan. As a whole, it is a bit of a mess and ends up being an exhausting experience that would’ve benefited from some judicious editing."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,75,Aquaman works because it isn’t laughing at itself—it’s both joyously whimsical and confident in its own seaworthiness.
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,75,"I don’t see Aquaman ever reaching icon status, but I’ll say this: He’s a lot more fun on his own, when he’s not saddled with those overly serious stiffs Superman and Batman."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,75,"In making the first DC superhero film in a long time to aspire to anything like levity, Wan finds a way to catalyze what might have been yet another dust-dry origin story. The secret? Just add water."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,75,"A big dumb acid-trip of a super-hero movie, Aquaman is relentless, noisy, entertaining nonsense – particularly in 3D IMAX - as overlong as any of them, but not boring, and as I say, at times trippy."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,75,The glee that director James Wan clearly has playing in the world of Aquaman is infectious. He’s made a movie for both types of 10-year-olds: literal kids and those who are 10 at heart. Aquaman is one hell of a popcorn movie.
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,70,"There’s a level of self-awareness in Aquaman’s more grandiose images and plot movements that’s certainly been missing from previous DC movies. The story is so deliberately corny that it’s never really moving, no matter how much it reaches in the direction of emotion."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,70,"Wan not only embraces the inherent silliness of a hero whose signature power is talking to fish; he revels in it, finding the childlike awesomeness at its core. You can still see every plot beat coming from miles away, but it feels like destiny rather than repetition, the fulfillment of a promise every movie makes and few deliver on."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,70,"Notwithstanding the inevitable formulaic dialogue and a superabundance of boilerplate superhero action sequences, Aquaman turns out to be, almost despite itself, an engaging undersea extravaganza."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,70,"Aquaman’s as formulaic, excessively thrashy, and mommy-obsessed as any other entry in the DCEU, but its visual imagination is genuinely exciting and transportive, and dare I say, fun."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,70,"Aquaman is imaginatively ambitious superhero cinema with no rules, which is more positive than negative as Wan's vision is realized like an underwater laser light spectacle that the DCEU so desperately needs right now."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,69,"For the most part, the DCEU just can’t square its admittedly exciting set pieces with solid storytelling. In turn, whenever Aquaman pops a squat to unload exposition, it grinds to an interminable halt. Those action scenes, though. Revolutionary at best, innovative at worst."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,67,"Aquaman also benefits from a cast that is unafraid to chew a little scenery. Momoa is an established entity at this point in his career; equal parts cartoon character and Eighties action lead, he carries the film through its muddiest moments through sheer charisma."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,67,"Aquaman is a pure piece of bright, ridiculous spectacle, hammering its Saturday morning cartoon sensibilities down its audience’s throat with a huge, cheesy grin on its face."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,67,It owns up to its cheese.
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,67,"There’s a joy to the film’s ornate beauty, a loving craftsmanship that rescues Aquaman from the branded synergy that so haunts and chokes it elsewhere."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,63,Aquaman refuses to do anything original or unpredictable and turns into a by-the-numbers tale of how the trident-carrying King of Atlantis becomes a protector of both land and sea. It accomplishes this by hoping that special effects saturation will compensate for screenplay weaknesses.
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,63,An Aquaman sequel is reportedly in the works. The series already has a strong leading man and a feel for an epic. The filmmakers just need to find the heart of their ocean.
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,63,"Even with its flaws and struggles with originality, Aquaman is reminiscent of the early Marvel movies in its storytelling, best when taking wild swings instead of being an earnest superhero jam."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,60,"Jason Momoa's surf-bro superhero is a welcome addition to a ponderously serious genre, but his movie as a whole feels waterlogged."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,60,"At the end of the day (or, anytime of the day, really) I think I admire Aquaman more than I like it. It’s certainly ambitious."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,60,"Overlong, but Momoa’s charisma, plus first-class fishy FX, keep it afloat."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,60,"A superhero movie with the scope of an epic but the spirit of a mischievous boy, Aquaman is a goofy, uneven adventure that proudly sticks to its loopy vision even if it doesn’t quite work."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,60,"Aquaman’s greatest strength is its visual style. Even when it borders on bioluminescent whimsy, it’s so distinctly and ceaselessly its own, instead of mimicking its DC/Warner Bros. counterparts. You almost don’t mind that you’re watching comic book cheesiness or such a convoluted plot because, like Momoa’s hair, it’s just so fun to look at."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,60,"There are some legitimate criticisms you can level against Aquaman. You could never say, however, that this movie doesn’t go for it. It goes for everything — maybe too much, when all is said and done."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,60,"This is an Aquaman film that needs lots more Aquaman and vastly less bombast. It’s visually wild and recklessly inventive, but the cast deserve better than to be cast adrift in a tempest of CGI."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,50,"At least Aquaman has a different palette, and new shapes to work with. It’s still ultimately silly and dreary, and will test the endurance of fans who then must withstand an even longer credit sequence to get a whiff of the next DC story wrinkle."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,50,"Aquaman is a mess of clashing tones and shameless silliness, but a relief after all the franchise’s recent superhero gloom. Any budget-busting epic that finds time to show us an octopus playing bongos gets a pass in our book."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,50,"Aquaman’s first glimpse of Atlantis is meant to convey wonder, but mostly there’s a sense of digitally over-busy déjà vu, as we’re reminded of more inventively designed fantasyscapes in “Thor,” “Avatar” and so on."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,50,"To both the movie’s benefit and detriment, the seas here are choppier than in the predictably (and sometimes boringly) smooth sailing of a Marvel movie. But the bright spots (Momoa, that octopus) can be difficult to really relish amid the oceans of exposition and a typically pulverizing, overelaborate screenplay."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,50,"This visually clumsy and gauche, but spectacular, movie knows what it wants to be when it grows up for better or worse."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,50,"Aquaman gets his own adventure, and it’s kind of a shock that it doesn’t suck, but only if you’re willing to sit through two hours of water-logged world-building before the movie finally takes off."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,50,"One is grateful to have Momoa for company. Unlike some strutters who can't hide how delighted they are to show off their trainer-honed bods, Momoa wears his superb physique casually and his take-it-or-leave-it, devil-may-care attitude makes the narrative's long haul much easier to bear than would otherwise have been the case."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,50,"In a better world, Aquaman would excel at delivering an ecological message to the masses. But all the fish in the sea can’t salvage a movie that refuses to go more than surface deep."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,42,"Wan, a director who’s proven himself to be a can’t-miss ace regardless of genre (from the horror formulas of The Conjuring and Insidious to the big-budget tentpole mayhem of Furious 7) seems to finally be out of his depth. He’s conjured an intriguing world, but populated that world with dramatic cotton candy and silly characters, including a hero who’s unsure if he wants to make us laugh or feel — and winds up doing neither. Pass the Dramamine."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,40,"It’s just two and a half years of — sorry, two and a half hours — of oceanic screen savers and hair that won’t stop undulating so we know when we’re underwater."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,40,"There is the occasional cool visual and clever world-building detail, like jellyfish couture and eye-popping underwater physics, but Aquaman never fully commits to its lunacy."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,40,"The film isn’t totally unenjoyable, but it isn’t particularly coherent either."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,40,"For all its sporadic wackiness and wonder, on balance Aquaman still comes out a bore. But they’ve given it a heroic shake."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,40,"Wilson is just, frankly, dull. He is not allowed to develop an interesting character and he suffers from the obvious comparison with Loki, Thor’s adopted brother played with relish by Tom Hiddleston as a velvety-voiced villain. But then Momoa’s good-ol’-boy characterisation of Aquaman itself only goes so far. This is a film that never quite comes up for air."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,38,"This bloated, big-screen take on the DC comic is dumb, but not nearly dumb enough."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,38,"Aquaman has that usual DC bloat about it, too much attempted, a movie not trimmed (in the script stage) into its best, most coherent story, sharpest jokes and most important confrontations."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,38,"Watching this movie is like spending two hours and 27 minutes staring at a gigantic aquarium full of digital sea creatures and actors on wires, pretending to swim."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,38,"Often divertingly colorful and busy to a fault, the film seems to dare us to mock the world of comics' most risible superhero."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,37,"On the plus side is the eye-popping production design, although that is also, like the plot, too, too much, dazzling the eye with more fantastical Atlantean technology and — inexplicably — underwater fire than a Las Vegas edition of Cirque du Soleil. Like the frequently shirtless Momoa, it’s pretty at first, then it just hurts."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,25,It seems director James Wan had one overarching goal in making “Aquaman.” His prime directive? Crush the audience into submission.
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,25,"Aquaman continues to revel in the outdated 1970s superhero ideal that mankind is unquestionably worth saving. Add to that some awkward dialogue, a poorly conceived visual effects palette, and a soul-crushing and bladder-crushing 139-minute run time, and you have another disappointing entry in the DC Comics cinematic universe."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,100,"Guardians Of The Galaxy is everything we go to the movies for, as Gunn is able to build an intricate intergalactic world full of multiple races, lush scenery, and maximum escapism through action, romance, comedy, and interstellar drama."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,100,"Surrender, earthlings. It’s the Guardians’ world and you’ll be happy to live in it."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,100,"It manages the trick of being both an unironic sci-fi action-adventure flick and a zippy parody of one. It’s exciting, funny, self-aware, beautiful to watch and even, for a flickering instant or two, almost touching."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,100,"Guardians Of The Galaxy is the most charming Marvel movie so far. The primary ensemble (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, and Vin Diesel) is perhaps the most winning group of characters they've introduced in any of these movies."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,91,Director James Gunn’s first foray into big-budget movie making succeeds despite focusing on characters largely unknown to mainstream audiences and provides some of the most genuinely affecting moments of any Marvel film to date.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,91,A perfectly irreverent counterpoint to movies that take their superheroes a bit too seriously.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,91,The film's a giddily subversive space opera that runs on self-aware smart-assery.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,91,[A] blend of classic sci-fi fare and current pop-culture irony is what rockets “Guardians” into the stratosphere.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,90,"Blessed with a loose, anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you're not quite sure what's going on, the scruffy ""Guardians"" is irreverent in a way that can bring the first ""Star Wars"" to mind."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,90,"It's easy to get carried away with movies like this, which lend themselves to fanboy hype. It's not a perfect movie. But it is one that is hugely enjoyable, bears repeated viewings and will be as funny in 10 years (or 50) as it is now. And that's pretty swell."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,89,Marvel’s rambunctious entry into the space opera genre—and the cornerstone of its “Cosmic Marvel” roster of characters and storylines—so perfectly embodies what the preceding months of hype and hope foretold that even its weak points (and it has its share) feel almost like unavoidable imperfections—broken eggs for a pretty satisfying omelet.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,88,"""Guardians” stands apart because it’s somehow truer to a comic book’s essence than any Marvel or DC-derived picture you can name. Which is to say it’s pulpy, kind of cheesy and giddily exaggerated (and aware of it) in a way that, say, the “Thors,” the “Captain Americas” and Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies are not."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,88,"Guardians of the Galaxy does the impossible. Through dazzle and dumb luck, it turns the clichés of comic-book films on their idiot heads and hits you like an exhilarating blast of fun-fun-fun. It's insanely, shamelessly silly – just one reason to love it."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,88,"Gunn makes this huge entertainment accessible to the converted and the neophyte alike, and he has only has one goal: To send you out of the theater with a fat smile on your face. Mission accomplished."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,88,"It’s filled with a kind of giddy energy that leaps off the screen. It’s corny, it’s dopey, it’s sincere, it’s romantic, it’s thrilling and it leaves one anticipating the next adventure of these heroic goofballs."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,83,"Gunn’s careful to keep the focus on the central five, but certainly proves himself capable of the bigger canvas. The film really pops visually, with an admirably bright color palette (DP Ben Davis doing excellent work), and though there are occasionally some geography issues, the action is mostly satisfying."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"The film, directed and co-written by James Gunn, is joyfully irreverent. Gunn lends his underachiever superheroes a geeky, comic camaraderie, and he brings a spry touch to the wacky intergalactic adventure."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"It is fast, it is fun."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"To see an expensive, big-studio movie freed from creative constraints and directorial cynicism is always a rare and wondrous experience. In a season of bloated indulgence, it’s also fair to call it a marvel."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Here, a pulse, wit, beauty and a real sensibility have been slipped into the fray, alongside the clockwork guffaws, kabooms and splats."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Gunn, a B-movie enthusiast who got his start at Troma, has found a way to bring funkiness and humanity to a galaxy-spanning blockbuster, one filled with dogfights and floating fortresses, but also with heroes quick with a quip, fast on the draw, and more than a little beaten up by the universe."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"As much as Guardians largely thrives through its lovably scuzzy style, it cannot avoid the immense tractor-beam pull of The Big Marvel Studios Final Act."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Overall this is giddy, ridiculous fun, a witty, wacky and wonderfully generous sugary gift of a film."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Mad, marvellous and all kinds of sci-fi magical, Guardians Of The Galaxy is Marvel’s riskiest but most surprising success yet."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Guardians of the Galaxy is undoubtedly a flashy space opera, but if you are on board with that, it's a resounding success that takes a seat at Marvel's top table and suggests there could still be life after The Avengers."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"The fun of it – and Guardians of the Galaxy specialises in fun, served by the sugar-sprinkled ice-cream-scoopload – is in seeing this odd quintet bluster through space battles and alien brawls that would have defeated anyone smarter and better-equipped. Just as the team makes do with the junk they find around them, the film feels like a mound of gems culled from decades of pop-culture scavenging."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Overall, the writers have crafted a well-articulated universe with distinct settings and relatable, compelling characters devoted to a thrilling quest for redemption."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,78,"Guardians of the Galaxy is an outlier: a space opera in a largely earthbound movie cycle (excepting the occasional red-eye to another dimension in the Thor pictures), candy-colored and bopping where the other Marvel movies are muted and imposing, and the funniest one to date, without a doubt."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"What works best in Guardians is, in fact, the camaraderie of the team itself and the heart applied to their slowly gelling sense of family."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"The gadgetry and fight scenes are nicely rendered. The aeronautical battles, though, fall well short of state-of-the-art. Maybe they're collateral damage to the film's goofy style."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"Too loud, too long and too busy but – here’s the good part – also wonderfully silly."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"The film’s fast, amusing, good-looking and not overlong, which is all sensible non-geeks ask of such movies."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"With its introduction of wonderfully memorable characters and blend of humor, action and catchy tunes, Guardians is perfectly pitched escapist fun."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"A fun and relatively fresh space Western. Think “Firefly” pitched at 15-year-olds, with a lot of overt ""Star Wars"" nods. And super-“irreverent” dialogue that is, more often than not, genuinely funny."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"The motley crew’s repartee makes for comedy that’s surprisingly consistent, yet freewheeling and sharp enough to pinball from Kevin Bacon to Jackson Pollock and back."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,The film owes its relative buoyancy above all to Chris Pratt as the wisecracking space rogue at the helm.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"Guardians of the Galaxy is fun but forgettable, or perhaps Gunn crams so much onto the screen that memory is crowded out. Definitely worth a second look, just to figure out what in the name of Buckaroo Banzai is going on."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"The vibe, if not the specifics, is highly reminiscent of ""The Last Starfighter,"" ""Battlestar Galactica,"" ""Battle Beyond the Stars,"" and others. The fact that the movie's ""present"" is defined as being 1988 and the soundtrack is peppered with '70s tunes cements the retro feeling."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"Guardians boasts not one, but two Han Solo proxies — not to mention an ass-kicking Princess Leia surrogate, a villain with a very Sithian fashion sense, and the flora answer to Chewbacca. Also, one of the Han Solo types is a talking raccoon."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"Laugh-out-loud funny and production-designed to death, Guardians of the Galaxy pops off the screen."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"Though the special effects win the day, Guardians of the Galaxy holds court with a sense of humor that transcends its more familiar ingredients."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"The film’s scruffy, smartass band of brothers, along with Gunn’s light directorial touch, make for an invigorating breather after too many summer weekends of hammer-wielding superheroic solemnity."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"The film seems content to be the class clown of the Marvel Universe, which is all well and good. But like most class clowns, sometimes you wish it would apply itself — because it seems capable of being so much more."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"A likable lightweight, though it's heavy enough on cosmic combat and dazzling effects."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"It’s a high-spirited, swashbuckling lark driven by cartoonish special effects and an ingenious double-layered nostalgia that allows it to become a virtual mixtape of ‘70s hits that predate its intended audience: “Hooked on a Feeling,” “The Piña Colada Song,” “Fooled Around and Fell in Love,” etc."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"Unlike the stiff-jawed heroics of the other Marvel films, this feels a little looser and lighter, with Pratt as charming, amoral accidental leader Peter Quill, an earthling among the stars who, as he will tell you, is also known as the roving brigand “Starlord.”"
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"Director James Gunn’s presumptive franchise-starter is overlong, overstuffed and sometimes too eager to please, but the cheeky comic tone keeps things buoyant — as does Chris Pratt’s winning performance as the most blissfully spaced-out space crusader this side of Buckaroo Banzai."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,63,"For every scene that soars into the dizzying heights of the pop sublime, there's another that crashes back down into the mundane troughs of studio-mandated formula."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,60,"The movie practically satirises itself as it goes along, glossing over its own absurdity in the process."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,50,It’s a bit of a botch.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,50,"Guardians of the Galaxy is pretty much where action movies are these days - a combination of comedy without wit, action without drama and elaborate visuals that are nothing much to look at."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,50,"Gunn has to juggle so many plot elements — so many booming galactic battles, so many whisker-close brushes with death — that it's little wonder he loses his grip on the thing. He inserts occasional moments of wonder but doesn't bother to smooth over the seams."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,25,"Guardians of the Galaxy brings to mind some of the most unforgettable sci-fi event movies of the last 30 years. Alas, those films are “Howard the Duck” and “Green Lantern.”"
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,75,"As potential blockbusters go, Batman v Superman is neither as stupid nor as stupendous as it might have been."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,75,Batman v Superman lacks the levity (forced or otherwise) of a typical Marvel Universe entry. But Snyder's superpowered epic does have a sense of import and grandeur about it.
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,75,"When it sings, “Dawn of Justice” is a wonder. When it drags, it still looks good and offers hints of a better scene just around the corner."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,75,"Better than Man of Steel but below the high bar set by Nolan's Dark Knight, Dawn of Justice is still a colossus, the stuff that DC Comics dreams are made of for that kid in all of us who yearns to see Batman and Superman suit up and go in for the kill."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,75,"BvS will please those either waiting for the two main players to lock horns on a movie screen, or those who've just been pining for Wonder Woman forever. And for the nerdier crowds, a fleeting glimpse at other superheroes hints this is the Dawn of something potentially sensational."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,70,"The director, a strong technician whose slam-bang emphatic, occasionally operatic style seems made for comic book adaptations, has been well-served by an adept script co-written by Chris Terrio (an Oscar winner for Ben Affleck's ""Argo"") and David S. Goyer, which raises a number of interesting issues."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,70,"Snyder has set a Sisyphean task for himself. That this very long, very brooding, often exhilarating and sometimes scattered epic succeeds as often it does therefore has to be seen as an achievement."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,63,"Once Batman v Superman hits its stride, most viewers will feel equal parts pummeled and immersed. Snyder is a master of the dark spectacle and he pours it on starting around the movie’s midpoint.... Still, although viewers may be riveted at times, the net experience isn’t much fun."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,63,This is a comic book epic with a lot of fat and flab around the edges. But the fights are shorter and more involving than the “Transformers” cluttered clashes of “Man of Steel.”
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,63,"There are a few brilliantly realized moments, the acting is mostly strong despite the weak script (Affleck and Cavill are both superb—Affleck unexpectedly so), and there's enough mythic raw material sunk deep in every scene that you can piece together a classic in your mind if you're feeling charitable; but if you aren't, “Batman v. Superman” will seem like a missed opportunity."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,60,"This movie isn’t nearly as terrible as I was expecting, largely due to Snyder’s OCD-level attention to the visual details. And, yes, due to Wonder Woman (played by Israeli actress Gal Gadot), who brings in a badly needed dose of “Dragon Tattoo”-style female energy."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,60,"This is a movie that, to its detriment, takes itself very, very seriously for most of its running time."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,60,"Yes, questions regarding violence and mayhem are drowned out by violence and mayhem. Such is the superhero life as directed by Zack Snyder. There is no problem that can't be solved with a cranium-rattling explosion or two."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,60,"While Batman v Superman has no trouble quickening the pulse, it’s less effective when it comes to making you care."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,60,"It’s tough to take all the hardcore emoting seriously, particularly as the emotional heavy lifting is designed to be done by the occasional maudlin line in brief pauses between the explosions. For a film so concerned with its characters’ inner lives, there’s a fundamental disconnect going on here – enough to make you yearn for the lighter touch of the Marvel films."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,60,"There are moments that make the whole enterprise worthwhile, and introduces an intriguing new Batman. But it’s also cluttered and narratively wonky; a few jokes wouldn’t have gone amiss, either."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,58,"I get that this mano a supermano story line is a sacred text among comic-book aficionados, but Dawn of Justice doesn’t do the tale any favors. It’s overstuffed, confusing, and seriously crippled by Eisenberg’s over-the-top performance."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,55,"That face-off between two comics legends becomes but one in a series of big things bashing into other big things, which is what Snyder and writers Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer mistake for storytelling. The trio do manage to cough up an acceptable number of ooh-that’s-cool moments, and fans who will be satisfied with those will be satisfied with those, but any other ideas and characters the movie might offer get lost in the rubble."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,50,"It plants a flag for a new corporate entertainment franchise and it will make international containerships of money, so does it matter that Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is joyless and incoherent? Probably not."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,50,"Of course, the film is critic-proof, but as a longtime comic book (and film) nerd, I can say with some surety that Snyder has crammed too much of a great thing into his film, resulting in a super-slog that has just too much of everything."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,50,"A sequel that functions as origin story, apologia, and harbinger of a second expanded universe of overpopulated action bonanzas."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,50,"I recommend “Batman v. Superman” to anyone who thought director Zack Snyder showed too much restraint in “300,” who felt “Man of Steel” whisked by too briefly or who wondered how Ben Affleck could be made to seem one of America’s most animated actors while clenching his jaw as tight as a Christmas nutcracker."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,50,Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice was supposed to settle a fanboy debate older than Adam West. Instead it raises another: Is being a superhero really this much of a drag?
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,50,"The movie's not bad but it doubles down on its least-interesting and potent elements at the expense of those that actually work. In the end, the film is as forgettable as the dime-store philosophy that fuels it."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,50,"While “300"" maestro Snyder puts together some very striking scenes — which may be enough for many fanboys — they never really cohere into a whole. He literally throws in the kitchen sink in a film that frantically introduces characters and concepts while never clearly establishing the rules of the DC Comics universe."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,50,"This huge, unwieldy movie is busy and overcrowded."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,42,"I’m not sure how a filmmaker whose work normally speaks to me as clearly as Snyder’s does could deliver something that feels this confused, this impersonal, and this corporate. It is a confounding mess of a movie, and while there are individual sequences that I enjoyed as isolated moments, it is almost breathtakingly incoherent storytelling."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,42,"Batman V Superman takes a title fight kids of all ages have been speculating about for decades—costumed titan from the cosmos, meet costumed vigilante from the city—and invests it with all the fun of a protracted custody battle."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,42,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice isn’t a film. It’s a two-and-a-half-hour movie trailer. Better yet, it’s one of those videos that pop up on screens before a ride at Universal Studios, where all the actors speak to you and keep hinting at bigger things to come — you know, like a ride? Basically, it’s everything the SEO-friendly title promises — and more."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,42,"Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice is an extraordinarily odd, idiosyncratic movie that presents aggressive, even warlike concepts of Batman and Superman without entirely justifying the eccentric visions."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,42,"Rather than focusing on a cataclysmic showdown between pop culture's most famous men in tights, Zack Snyder's flashy, cacophonous follow-up to 2013's ""Man of Steel"" is basically one long teaser for the next installment."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"The winner, on points, is Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), who crashes the party and leaves them both dumbfounded, not least because she has the wit, and the wherewithal, to confront evil while wearing a conical bustier."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"Everything looks incredible, but the players are all just ciphers for ideas that Snyder lacks the wherewithal to execute."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"There’s enough going on to keep you watching — and, as I said, to keep fanboys wowed by the scale of the production and pretension. But most people will leave feeling drained and depressed, wondering how a studio can get away with withholding so much."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"It's all angst and no adventure, a lot of fury and little fun."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,Batman v Superman lunges for greatness instead of building toward it: It’s so topheavy with false portent that it buckles under its own weight.
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"In Snyder’s formulation, protecting the world from evil isn’t a gift or a calling; it’s a burden. And that feeling is reflected in the movie itself, a burdensome 150-minute slog about two men fighting over who is in the right when both are very clearly in the wrong."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"No major blockbuster in years has been this incoherently structured, this seemingly uninterested in telling a story with clarity and purpose."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"Gorging on bombast and self-importance, swamped by its own mythology, Batman v Superman is loud, sprawling, and distracted. The action jumps around almost as fast as a man can fly, but nowhere near as smoothly."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"The villain here, Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor, is so intensely annoying that, very early on, you wish Batman and Superman would just patch up their differences and join forces to put the squirrely rascal out of his, and our, misery."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"If there’s any justice, dawning or otherwise, at the multiplex, audiences will reject Zack Snyder’s lumbering, dead-on-arrival superhero mélange, a $250 million tombstone for a genre in dire need of a break."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,38,"The film might be pretty to look at, but narratively speaking, it is a disaster."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,38,Many decisions...make “Batman v Superman” a joyless slog.
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,38,"Snyder is not without skills, or ideas, but when a critic finds himself at odds with almost every aspect of a director’s visual approach to material like this, material like this becomes pretty joyless."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,37,"Strip away the trite character beats, rote plot points, random dream sequences and other narrative padding, and “Batman v Superman” comes down to the actors, their characters and whether they can sustain interest over the long haul. The answer is yes, if they wind up in the hands of filmmakers blessed with authentic imagination rather than serviceable technical chops."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,36,"Batman v Superman addresses Man Of Steel's problems in words without learning anything from it in tone. Instead, the new film doubles down on the grimness, the ugliness, and the indifference to human life."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,30,It is about as diverting as having a porcelain sink broken over your head.
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,25,"“Batman v Superman” is an insanely long and convoluted action movie, made worse by an air of importance. It’s dispiriting and visually bland."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,20,"Spasms of highfalutin philosophy, and howlingly pretentious dream sequences, serve only as the thinnest of veneers for incessant action in one of the most assaultive movies ever made."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,16,It is a movie ostensibly about consequences that never lingers long enough on its own story to consider that the things happening in the narrative present ought to have consequences as well. Very little matters; very little makes sense.
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,10,"To put it delicately, this comics fan hated Batman v Superman with the fury of a thousand red-dwarf suns. Blunt, humorless, and baffling, it collides the brutish directorial stamp of its director (he of 300 and Watchmen fame) with the most shameless instincts of our latter-day superhero franchise bubble."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,88,"Compared to its ilk, Suicide Squad is an excellently quirky, proudly raised middle finger to the staid superhero-movie establishment."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,83,"Suicide Squad is not the darkest mainstream superhero comic book movie ever made, nor is it even the darkest live-action film featuring Batman ever made. However, it is gleefully nihilistic, and it takes a different approach to what has become a fairly familiar story form at this point, right at the moment when it feels like superhero movies either have to evolve or die."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,80,"In the end, the characters are more lasting than the story, which is a standard save-the-city-from-destruction yarn. But this crew is a riot, and their world is intriguing and even a little meaningful."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,80,"Like Avengers Assemble forced through a Deadpool mangle, Suicide Squad gives new life to DC’s big-screen universe. So bad-to-the-bone it’s good."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,70,"David Ayer's film may not always work, but when it does, it's a perverse delight."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,67,"Writer-director David Ayer (End of Watch) skillfully sets up the film, introducing each of the crazies with caffeinated comic-book energy. But their mission...is a bit of a bust. The stakes should feel higher."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,63,"Suicide Squad had the potential to be as hilariously irreverent as “Deadpool,” a surprise box-office hit about a similarly sociopathic hero. Instead, it’s just another film that relies on special effects to distract the audience from a story that’s overblown and underwhelming."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,63,"Suicide Squad prides itself on being “dark,” but it’s really just jokey, cynical, and violent, not to mention visually ugly as sin. It’s as subversive as milk. But the cast and the pacing keep it moving."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,63,Suicide Squad does have quite a few tremendously entertaining sequences of high action and low comedy. It's a shame it never rises beyond that.
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,63,"“The Dirty Dozen,” one of my favorite war movies, will no doubt get a 50th-anniversary boxed set next year. Those of us who wait for it can mark time with Suicide Squad, which borrows the same concept and executes it with more lunacy and far less flair."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,63,"It’s Harley Quinn’s movie and everybody else in Suicide Squad is just a supporting character. No surprise there. That’s the way it is in the comic books, too. It’s all about personality, and Harley has that by the freight carload."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,60,"When it comes down to it, there's one overriding factor that lessens the impact of the film's numerous stumbles, and that's this: It's just plain entertaining to see all these warped characters, and all these well-cast actors, bouncing off of one another, interacting with one another, and creating a barely controlled chaos."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,60,"Suicide Squad is a so-so, off-peak superhero movie. It chases after the nihilistic swagger of “Deadpool” and the anarchic whimsy of “Guardians of the Galaxy” but trips over its own feet."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,60,"It’s probably best to think of Suicide Squad as a primer, an entry into a side world of the DC Universe that may pay bigger benefits in later films. It certainly seems like that’s how the filmmakers thought of it."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,60,"It’s a clotted and delirious film, with flashes of preposterous, operatic silliness. But it doesn’t have much room to breathe; there are some dull bits, and Leto’s Joker suffers in comparison with the late Heath Ledger."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,60,"Starts off flavourful, turns rather bland. This Injustice League jaunt proves that DC is still a long way behind Marvel for on-screen action."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,60,Fans will probably appreciate Suicide Squad for trying something different — and it gets bonus points for diversity — but the weaker characters and generally weak plot keep it from being one of the better comic book movies.
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,58,"Like so many of Ayer’s directorial efforts, Suicide Squad feels like it was re-drafted in the editing room. It’s clumsy, disrupted by at least eight different plodding flashbacks, filled with lines of dialogue that cut well into trailers but make zero sense in context, and patched up with an embarrassment of rock-along musical cues."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,58,"It's the garish swarm of colorfully twisted action that Batman v Superman needed, the anarchic approach such timeworn superheroes deserve. Suicide Squad characters aren't nearly as familiar, so writer-director David Ayer's movie is also messy, not entirely by design."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,50,"Regrettably, the film’s place-setting opening lays the scene for a different, more exciting film that never really unfolds."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,50,"It gets props for kinetic energy, bursts of suspense, and a couple of bravura performances (Will Smith & Margot Robbie). But pretty much everything else is either mediocre or substandard and that makes it hard to champion this bloated and cheerless monstrosity."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,50,"Suicide Squad is a concept in search of a story worth telling. Both energized and betrayed by its “Worst.Heroes.Ever” theme and writer-director David Ayer’s trademark visceral filmmaking, it ends up in a kind of limbo, not as strong as partisans will insist or as worthless as its weakest elements would have you believe."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,50,"Writer-director David Ayer tries hard to make this dirty not-quite-dozen into an engaging band of misfits, but the results feel undercooked and overstuffed, with 10 pounds of supervillain backstory being crammed into a five-pound bag."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,50,Suicide Squad does have its moments of beautiful comic-book visuals.... Those are just tantalizing hints of a better movie that never materialized.
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,50,"The action beats are taut, but the story arc crumbles under the weight of all the movies it steals from. The casting fails to pop, in most instances."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,45,"The film doesn't go far enough in setting its own course. Ayer works to establish those villains as gleeful fantasies of unfettered freedom, then fetters them with maudlin backstories that make them all sad, soulful, misused, and misunderstood."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,42,"Writer-director David Ayer doesn’t have the right graphic technique for a comic-book-style jamboree – he’s strictly a noirish-pulp guy – and the characters, all of whom are promisingly introduced, fizzle fast."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,42,"Instead of focusing on the squad in the title — the chemistry the audience wants to see — Ayer doubles down on the usual DC tics: dark fights, a humdrum dependence on guns and fists, a cynical everyone-sucks grasp of politics, and sudden rain showers that people ignore. It’s moody and mindless, an angry toddler screaming over his parents’ classic rock mix of The Rolling Stones, The Animals, and a 14-year-old song from Eminem."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,42,"Muddled characters and uneven storytelling are the roots of the issues here, but the ways in which Ayer seems to try to cover up his film’s deficiencies grate most of all."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,42,"For all of the film’s nonstop, aggressive insistence on its subversive qualities, it’s about as radical and unconventional as a teenager buying a Leftover Crack shirt with their mom’s credit card from Amazon."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,42,"Suicide Squad isn’t a terrible movie per se and judged against its forbearer, ‘Batman v Superman,’ it resembles a shining beacon of coherence. But Suicide Squad isn’t a very good movie either, a mediocre effort with commonplace ideas of rebelliousness and salvation."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,40,"Despite its claims to zaniness and colouring outside the lines, probably the most damning indictment of the silly Suicide Squad is that it's unrelentingly bland."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,40,"There’s no one to root for in this movie, and no one whose prospects we care about. Several plot points lack coherence, and inserted flashbacks add to a sense of the film having been fused into shape in the editing room. It seems that Suicide Squad was done in by its own hand."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,40,"On paper, this could have been the antidote to an increasingly codified strain of comic-book movies, but in the end, it’s just another high-attitude version of the same."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,40,"When you compare Suicide Squad to what James Gunn and Marvel Studios achieved in Guardians of the Galaxy – low-profile property, oddball characters, make-it-fun brief – the film makes you cringe so hard your teeth come loose. But it’s a slog even on its own crushingly puerile terms."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,40,"A puzzlingly confused undertaking that never becomes as cool as it thinks it is, Suicide Squad assembles an all-star team of supervillains and then doesn’t know what to do with them."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,40,"Boasting a darker, more nihilistic streak than the typical comic-book film, this Warner Bros. release has its kinky pleasures and some amusing nastiness, but in the final analysis there’s simply too much flexing of empty attitude — and far too much self-congratulation for how edgy it thinks it is."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,38,"If it has a genius for anything, it’s disorganization: What promised to be a Super Bowl of villainy turned out more like toddler playtime."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,38,"With a few, rare exceptions, the attempts at humor in “Suicide Squad” land with a thud—that is, if you can hear such a sound over the deafening din of gunfire and the bombastic score."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,38,"But folks, this is a lousy script, blobby like the endlessly beheaded minions of the squad's chief adversary. It's not satisfying storytelling; the flashbacks roll in and out, explaining either too much or too little, and the action may be violent but it's not interesting."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,37,"Sadly, Suicide Squad feels like a watered-down version of what could have been a stiff drink."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,33,"Suicide Squad never has the courage of its convictions — it doesn’t own anything. At best, Ayer rents some pre-existing pop iconography and charges us $15 to watch him take it around the block for a spin. Forget the “Worst. Heroes. Ever.” These guys don’t even know how to be bad."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,30,"To say that the movie loses the plot would not be strictly accurate, for that would imply that there was a plot to lose, and that Ayer, in a forgetful moment, left it in the glove compartment of his car on the way to the studio."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,30,"Suicide Squad’s only triumph may be that it manages to make Batman v Superman look better by comparison. Bloated and baffling as that film was, it at least had a coherent aesthetic—a morose aesthetic, to be sure, but an aesthetic all the same. Suicide Squad, by contrast, is little more than a drab patchwork, its stitching the only thing uglier than the cloth."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,30,"The visuals in the final battle have some charm: They reminded me of early Tsui Hark Hong Kong extravaganzas like Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain and A Chinese Ghost Story (which he produced). But there was passion in those HK pictures, along with acrobatic wire-work. Promiscuous CGI makes even the miraculous seem ho-hum."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,30,"Harley Quinn’s entrance is the best moment in Suicide Squad. After that, you can leave. Robbie is a criminally appealing actress, likable in just about every way, but that intro aside, Suicide Squad doesn’t serve her well. It serves no one well, least of all its audience."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,30,"From the first scene to the last, it’s an absolute mess."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,25,"Like the recruited criminals themselves, the film longs to be bad, yet its forced by outside pressures to follow narrow, preset rules."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,25,"There isn’t a moment of spontaneous fun or humor in this long, turgid movie, the latest let-down for rabid DC Comics fans who’ve been waiting for someone to pick up the baton Christopher Nolan left behind and do this universe justice. With “Suicide Squad,” the long wait continues."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,25,"Suicide Squad wussies out when it should have been down with the Dirty Dozen of DC Comics. Audiences complained that Batman v Superman was too dark and depressing. So director-writer David Ayer (End of Watch, Fury) counters with light and candy-assed. I call bullshit."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,20,"Decadence is supposed to be fun, surely, or at least more fun than the desperate, sludgy, frantic mess of Suicide Squad."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,0,"In a word, Suicide Squad is trash. In two words, it’s ugly trash."
Suicide Squad,6,325100054,0,"It’s the kind of torment you can wish on your worst enemy without feeling too guilty, not something to inflict permanent damage, just two hours of soul-sickening confusion and sensory torment."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,100,"Far from lazy, it is a fairly brilliant sendup of comic-book action movies, as well as also being an excellent example of one."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,92,"The film ends on a remarkably touching emotional note. Had it held to the strength of its convictions—and it is immensely obvious why it did not—it might have been the best ending of any superhero movie to date. (No, the bar’s not terribly high.) But it’s nonetheless awfully good, and we can still look forward to, mid-credits, the world’s best-ever Green Lantern joke."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,90,A superhero movie so tightly made and brilliantly entertaining that even Deadpool himself would have trouble finding fault with it.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,88,"Deadpool 2 is wicked, dark fun from start to finish, with some twisted and very funny special effects, cool production elements, terrific ensemble work — and for dessert, perhaps the best end-credits “cookie” scene ever."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,88,Deadpool 2 throws everything it has at you until you throw your arms up in happy surrender.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,83,"Is Deadpool 2 obnoxious? Is it needlessly self-aware? Is it drunk on its own fairly tame naughtiness? Is it so stuffed full of unrelated pop culture references that it sort of feels like a meme shirt come to life? The answer to all those questions is a resounding yes, but it’s also, weirdly, refreshing."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,83,"Deadpool 2, while extremely thin on plot, is gleefully impish, entertaining and often laugh-out-loud funny. Almost everything that felt forced, crass and hamfisted in the original film now feels organic and effortless; a constant breezy stream of gags, quips and expertly choreographed action. Deadpool 2 is filthier, funnier and ferociously manic."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,81,"The result isn't as novel as the original, or as effortlessly kinetic, but it is nevertheless a joke-packed action film that continues to deliver on the character's potential, while opening up the door to an even bigger series of sarcastic superhero adventures."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"Infinity War will likely be first choice for the summer season crowd, but Deadpool 2 wins hands down in terms of personal stakes and visual flair."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"This is the rare comedy sequel that doesn’t just equal the original: it betters it, with bells and ball-sacks on."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"Right now, he's the perfect ""Avengers"" antidote."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"Deadpool 2 is, above all else, a lot of fun. (And yes, you must stay for the post-credit scenes.) Sometimes it maybe doesn’t take itself seriously enough (after about the 50th crack you do kind of want to tell Reynolds to hold off for a minute). But in a genre that takes itself so deadly seriously, this is like a breath of fresh air."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"Funnier, filthier, and damn entertaining, Deadpool 2 leaves no stone un-deconstructed: the naughty man-child of the X-Men universe who manages to beat them at their own game."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"There's action aplenty throughout the film, but Deadpool 2 doesn't bog down in it as many overcooked comic-book sequels do. With Reynolds' charismatic irreverence at its core, the pic moves from bloody mayhem to lewd comedy and back fluidly, occasionally even making room to go warm and mushy."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,78,"Despite the character’s trademark flippancy, there’s a real unexpected warmth to Deadpool 2. Not only does the sequel explore this flawed character, it firmly establishes him as a loveable and effective hero."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"The film’s greatest asset is Reynolds, who in Deadpool finally found the role of his dreams. Reynolds totally sells the character’s blend of reckless self-absorption and reluctant heroics."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Here, Leitch uses brevity to do for witty action what it famously does for wit alone."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"The bottom line is that viewers who enjoyed Deadpool will almost certainly enjoy Deadpool 2, although perhaps not quite as much."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"After shooting lots of people and cutting lots of throats, Deadpool tries blowing himself up, something he probably should have done first. And with that, the movie shifts. Deadpool 2 becomes less violent and a lot funnier. It becomes a much better movie than the original “Deadpool,” not an action bloodbath with laughs, but a knowing spoof of the superhero genre."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"If you’ve got comics-movie fatigue, with frequent fourth-wall breaks to point out lazy writing, blatant foreshadowing or heavy reliance on CGI for fight scenes, Deadpool 2 is here for you. That doesn’t mean those things aren’t there (they are) — but the eagerness of Deadpool to call out its own shortcomings earns this trash-talking franchise a lot of goodwill."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Deadpool 2 is chock-full of all the cartoonish ultraviolence, meta commentary and pop-culture references you’d expect. Where it surprises — and why it works so well — is how it balances an actually touching undercurrent alongside superhero subversiveness."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Reynolds is once again at his arch and nihilist best here, while acting and jumping in so much facial prosthetics that it makes him look like he’s inside melted cheese — or, as the first movie put it, an avocado that had relations with an older avocado."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"It’s in Deadpool’s DNA to channel the wild id of a 12-year-old boy — a very clever one who happens to love boobs, Enya, and blowing stuff up. Which is dizzy fun for a while, like eating Twinkies on a Gravitron. Eventually, though, it just wears you out."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Deadpool 2 is just like “Deadpool” only more so. It’s actually a fair bit better — funnier, more inventive than the 2016 smash...and more consistent in its chosen tone and style: ultraviolent screwball comedy."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Like so many franchise-starting first films, “Deadpool” had to push through some necessary evils to get to the good stuff, fortunately, all that subversive goodness is on wild display in Deadpool 2, which delivers on the promise of the first film (and more)."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,Does Deadpool 2 pick up its predecessor’s baton and run off to new and exciting places? Not really. Is it as tasty as leftovers on the second day? Absolutely. Temper your expectations accordingly.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Deadpool 2 gets by as simply on a par with “Deadpool,” an ultra-violent joked-up Energizer Bunny of a comic book movie with a fun supporting cast, dead-pan deaths and deadpan Deadpool jokes about those deaths."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,71,"Deadpool 2 is at its best when it cheerfully doesn’t give a shit. The more it cared, the less I did."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,70,"Deadpool 2 is an overstuffed cinematic burrito of raunchy insults, dismembering violence and a ""no f#*ks given"" attitude that's ready to burst at any second, but somehow holds together bite after enjoyable bite."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,70,"In almost every respect, this sequel is an improvement on its 2016 predecessor: Sharper, grosser, more narratively coherent and funnier overall, with a few welcome new additions. It’s a film willing to throw everything — jokes, references, heads, blood, guts and even a little bit of vomit — against the wall, rarely concerned about how much of it sticks."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,67,It all boils down to one important fact: Reynolds gets these comics.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,67,"It still works. Maybe not as well, since the element of shock and awe can’t be put back into its bottle, but anyone who enjoyed Wilson’s transformation into a bullet-hole-riddled leotard that can’t shut up should have as much fun."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,67,"Though bringing in a bona fide action-cheese aesthete like David Leitch (Atomic Blonde, John Wick) to direct counts as a minor coup, Deadpool 2’s attempts to fight superhero fatigue with self-awareness and meta shock value can become exhausting. Indulgent and uneven, but in spots gruesomely funny, the new film badly lacks the basic momentum of the original’s formulaic plot."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,63,"Deadpool 2 is very good at what it does, which is flattering the audience into feeling like it’s in on the joke. If you’re a doubter, though, you may wonder if the joke’s on us."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,63,"Since Deadpool 2 shows no sign of wanting to rewrite a whole genre with its audacity, we might as well concede that it does the job it apparently wants to do with professionalism and flair, and that the faster we end this piece, the faster you can go on social media and complain about it."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,63,The original “Deadpool” caught lightning in a bottle. The sequel sparks only intermittently.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,60,"The fight sequences aren’t as good as director David Leitch’s previous work like Atomic Blonde and the John Wick movies, but it’s better than the standard superhero fare, with enough clever touches to keep things interesting."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,60,"There is something ever so slightly dishonest about this character, something false about the boundaries drawn around his sadism and his rage. Deadpool 2 dabbles in ugliness and transgression, but takes no real creative risks."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,60,"Perhaps it’s the effort of introducing so many new characters that has sucked out the spontaneity from Deadpool: still, it’s nothing that can’t be sorted for the likely next installments."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,60,The movie’s other major weakness is its continued foregrounding of the white guys at the expense of the consciously inclusive cast around them.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,60,"With its uncompromising commitment to gross-out injuries, nerdy pop culture in-jokes and inappropriate touching, Deadpool 2 was clearly made to cater to existing fans with every innuendo-filled moment (they should stay through the credits for some important story points that are very nearly thrown away)."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,58,"Deadpool 2 likes to situate itself as the subversive alternative to so many bloated X-Men films, with all their grave self-importance and bombastic action, but even more of this go-around resembles those movies than its predecessor, and if it reads to you as more than a bit hypocritical, just know you’re hardly alone."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,50,"In Deadpool 2, the manic antics fly fast, but the franchise loses its edge as wise-cracking antihero Deadpool goes dadcore, attempting to infuse standard-issue four-quadrant studio blockbuster beats into what was once a revolutionary R-rated premise."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,50,"Rather than face its own moral incoherence, Deadpool 2 blinks."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,50,Deadpool 2 muddies the distinction between parodying comic-book-movie conventions and perfunctorily adhering to them.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,50,"Never before have the demands of my inner man-child been so stirred, though, than while experiencing Deadpool 2, a movie that feels scribbled in pencil crayon, drenched in Jolt cola and coated with the dust of a thousand discarded bags of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,40,"Not too far beneath the movie’s superficial abrasiveness is a desperate desire to be loved, a puppyish determination that is both hard to resist and, eventually, difficult to endure."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,40,"There’s no other way to put this: Deadpool 2 is a regular, shmegular superhero movie, distinguished only by an obnoxiously unearned dose of “see what I did there?!” It’s a drag."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,40,"It’s a long movie and when its star isn’t on screen and cracking wise, the boundary-pushing shocks and endless self-references wear thin. Still, if you’re the Deadpool fanatic who recently had Reynolds’s name tattooed on his arse, you definitely won’t be grumbling."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,40,"We’ve reached superhero saturation point, and Deadpool 2 is less a satire of that condition than a symptom of it. It has zero suspense — it’s too hip, too meta, for suspense."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,30,"It’s overstuffed, and essentially empty."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"A grand and glorious film that may well be the smash hit of 1977, and certainly is the best movie of the year so far."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"Star Wars is, quite simply, one of the best family entertainment buys you can make this summer. It’s a gorgeous, fantastic toy, a marvelous science fiction film that anyone can enjoy, sci fi fan or not."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"It is, on the other hand, enormous and exhilarating fun for those who are prepared to settle down in their seats and let it all wash over them. Which I firmly believe, with the extra benefit of hindsight, is more or less exactly what the vast majority of the cinema-going public want just now."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"I loved Star Wars and so will you, unless you're . . . oh well, I hope you're not...Star Wars is a hell of a lot of fun and Lucas makes fun a sparkling pop metaphor for the sheer joy of goodness that could even make friends out of men, mutations and machines."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"An exhilarating update of ""Flash Gordon,"" very much in the same half-jokey, half-earnest mood, but backed by special effects that, for once, really work and are intelligently integrated with the story."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"If I were asked to say with certainty which movies will still be widely known a century or two from now, I would list ""2001,'' ""The Wizard of Oz,'' Keaton and Chaplin, Astaire and Rogers, and probably ""Casablanca'' ... and ""Star Wars,'' for sure."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"Like all great craftsmen, Lucas has managed to fashion this material in a manner that not only honors the original sources, but makes it uniquely his own. Hacks rip off other movies; artists synthesize and pay homage to their inspirations."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"Star Wars, set “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,” is the most exciting picture to be released this year — exciting as theater and exciting as cinema. It is the most visually awesome such work to appear since “2001: A Space Odyssey,” yet is intriguingly human in its scope and boundaries."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"A marvelous child of Star Wars technology, the advanced sound design makes a celebratory re-viewing of George Lucas' legendary, 20-year-old space opera a thrilling experience. [Special Edition]"
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"A magnificent film. George Lucas set out to make the biggest possible adventure fantasy out of his memories of serials and older action epics, and he succeeded brilliantly."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"The aerial dogfight Dykstra and Stears have helped Lucas perfect as his climactic piece de resistance looks more exciting than its antecedents in live-action war movies. Its the most gorgeous stylized combat sequence since the underwater battle at the end of ""Thunderball,"" a project that won an Oscar for Stears."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,Lucas combines excellent comedy and drama and progresses it with exciting action on tremendously effective space battles. Likeable heroes on noble missions and despicable villains capable of the most dastardly deeds are all wrapped up in some of the most spectacular special effects ever to illuminate a motion picture screen. The result is spellbinding and totally captivating on all levels.
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,Star Wars is the most entertaining sci-fi movie of the decade.
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"Star Wars is somewhat grounded by a malfunctioning script and hopelessly infantile dialogue, but from a technical standpoint, it is an absolutely breathtaking achievement."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,90,"There is something dazzling about a sci-fi film that manages to call upon the energies of both futurism and long-held faith. The movie is not to be compared in ferocity of imagination with Kubrick’s “2001”—significant that the music here is merely illustrative, never caustic or memorable, and that there is nothing of Kubrick’s vision of a blanched form of existence—but it is exuberantly entertaining."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,90,"Star Wars brought back for a new generation many of the most attractive elements of studio-era moviemaking, and it did so in breathless anthology form. For some young filmgoers this film acted as a doorway to the glory of the movies."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,90,"Star Wars had all the right stuff, and unlike its confounding progenitor, ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" it was fairy-tale simple: ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,"" good met evil. [Special Edition]"
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,88,"Let's discuss those extra four minutes for a second, shall we? I found them incredibly distracting. [Special Edition]"
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,80,"Everyone treats his material with the proper combination of solemnity and good humor that avoids condescension. One of Mr. Lucas's particular achievements is the manner in which he is able to recall the tackiness of the old comic strips and serials he loves without making a movie that is, itself, tacky."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,80,"Still packs an entertaining punch with its blend of old-movie formulas, new-age philosophies, and video-game visuals. A small amount of new material, added for the 20th-anniversary reissue, is fun to look for but doesn't make much difference to the story or its impact. [Special Edition]"
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,80,"Rendering all of its materials with a self-protective tongue-in-cheek tone, Star Wars is fun. But if the movie appeals to the child in all of us, it also may seem to the adult within a good deal less delightful. There's something depressing about seeing all these impressive cinematic gifts and all this extraordinary technological skills lavished on such puerile materials."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,75,"Strip Star Wars of its often striking images and its highfalutin scientific jargon, and you get a story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality, without even a “future” cast to them: Human beings, anthropoids, or robots, you could probably find them all, more or less like that, in downtown Los Angeles today. Certainly the mentality and values of the movie can be duplicated in third-rate non-science of any place or period."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,90,"Big, loud and full of testosterone-fueled car fantasies, Michael Bay's actioner hits a new peak for CGI work, showcasing spectacular chases and animated transformation sequences seamlessly blended into live-action surroundings."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,90,"Transformers is a wet dream for fanboys, with vehicles that whiz and whir into alien robots, spectacular sci-fi stunt chases, glistening military hardware, overheated computer software and brainy, hot girls who love Popular Mechanics."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,83,It's all about the sheer visceral rush of mega action.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,80,The movie's biggest misstep is a complete lack of the classic Transformers theme song. How do you not use the coolest ’80s toyline-turned-cartoon music ever?
Transformers,7.1,319071806,80,"The script may have rubbery legs, but the action is rock-hard. The surprise is the lightness of touch: treat as a comedy for best results."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,"The whole thing is too giddy to be taken seriously and too much of a confection to leave much of a lasting impression. But for 140 minutes, at least, it should give non-fanboys at least an idea of what all the fuss is about."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,"The energy never lets up, and two committed, unfussy leading actors are an improvement over other summer flicks."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,"Everything comes down to an epic battle between the Transformers and the Decepticons, and that's when my attention began to wander, and the movie lost a potential fourth star."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,A classic Michael Bay mega-movie. Interested in plot and character development? Move along. You're blocking the view.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,Even more ridiculous than it sounds.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,"Yes, it's loud, explosive and silly, but it also perfectly embodies the concept of a summer blockbuster with its simple good-guys-vs.-bad-guys plot, cheeky humor and flawless special effects."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,"The most surprising thing about Michael Bay's much-anticipated, blockbuster-bound Transformers is how funny the movie is."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,It's a heavy-metal opera with humor.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,"Grab some popcorn and make a pit stop, then sit back and enjoy it. You signed up for a movie about giant robots."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,"LaBeouf is likable and grounded, two things you need from the lead in a film like this, although his female co-stars seem to have been cast based on how well their Maxim covers would sell."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,"Just about everything connected to this movie is a tie-in, except for the popcorn. And even then I'm not too sure."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,70,"In previous movies, Michael Bay dabbled wearily in Homo sapiens. At last he has summoned the courage to admit that he has an exclusive crush on machines, and I congratulate him on creating, in Transformers, his first truly honest work of art."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,70,It's a wonderfully playful experience.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,70,"Depending on your expectations for Transformers, rear-ending theaters this July 4th, you’ll either be ecstatic or horrified to learn that the movie hits on all three cylinders in convincing fashion."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,70,"The final scene is pure teen wish fulfillment: Imagine making out with your girlfriend on the hood of your sentient Camaro, as your own personal robot bodyguard looks on fondly (all right, that part's a little creepy)."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,70,Transformers is mercilessly inhuman and completely hysterical from frame one.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,70,"For almost two hours of car chases and car wrecks and extraordinary animated transformation sequences that meld fluidly with live action, the welcome mat is out for Michael Bay's cheerfully dopey saga."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,67,"Bay, at heart, isn't a fantasist; he's a literal-minded maestro of demolition."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,63,"Partly impressive, partly inane buck-banging toy of a movie."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,63,The climax of Transformers contains all that is proficient and slick and all that is drecky and soulless in Bay's work.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,63,Some kind of mess...terpiece.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,50,Deafeningly loud and proudly silly epic.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,50,A movie of epically assaultive noise and nonsense.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,50,"8-year-olds of all ages, prepare to storm the multiplex!"
Transformers,7.1,319071806,42,Turns the franchise into a terrible '80s comedy.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,40,"Transformers' multiple earthling story lines are tedious and oddly lifeless, doing little besides marking time until those big toys fill the screen."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,40,Transformers is about as clever as an unplugged blender.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,40,The film has just enough collisions to be a crashing bore.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,38,"Louder, flashier, and more hollow than anything else out there."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,30,"Not a movie, just one gigantic commercial for Hasbro."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,100,"It’s a movie that, to put it in terms that the film’s screenwriters might appreciate, is Thor-ly needed."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,91,"It’s an enthusiastic, hilarious reboot of the idea of what a Marvel movie can actually be, resulting in an effervescent, delightfully self-aware ride that was the most fun I’d had in a superhero movie in years."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,90,"This is a Marvel movie that knows when to embrace the ridiculous and when to puncture any pomposity, and it's a delight from start to big finish. And yes, you do need to stay to the very very end of the credits."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,88,Just over two hours of entertaining but profoundly silly superheroism.
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,88,One of the many surprising delights in the bright and brassy and wonderfully funny Thor: Ragnarok is the recasting of the God of Thunder as a perpetual underdog.
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,87,"The third film in the arguably least-loved franchise of Kevin Feige and company’s box office-melting enterprise, it’s also the liveliest, funniest and “loosest” film of the bunch (and that includes Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2)."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,85,"Thor: Ragnarok is by far the most unusual of the Marvel movies – a crazy, colorful, ambitious, hilarious ride through the cosmos – even surpassing the Guardians of the Galaxy movies as the former holder of that title. And it’s by far the funniest."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"Thor: Ragnarok is a much goofier film than its 2011 and 2013 predecessors, and also a better one."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"Thor: Ragnarok, the latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is so delightfully funny that it’s almost a shame when the film reverts to its campy, melodramatic roots. Thankfully, that’s not hammered too hard."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"Thor: Ragnarok is a blast, pure and simple."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"In its own weird little way, Thor: Ragnarok manages to poke fun at the constant churn of myth and entertainment of which the movie itself is a part. It’s a candy-colored cage of delights, but it is a cage nevertheless — and it doesn’t hide that fact."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"Though the movie isn’t perfect, particularly in how it underuses some characters and gifted actors, those complaints are easily overridden by distinct moments where charm, oddity, and spectacle collide to create the kind of soul-soaring magic that Marvel at its best is capable of."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"This one is probably my favorite, being the most unlike the others."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"In a world of portentous blockbusters getting ever darker, it’s a joy to see one throwing on the disco lights."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"Ragnarok is both the MCU’s funniest outing yet and its clearest beneficiary of a playful, character-ful director’s voice since Guardians."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"The film’s deadpan good cheer makes room for big-budget spectacle and a modicum of emotional depth, but a self-effacing vibe and pop-culture giddiness work the best here — necessary countermeasures as Marvel fights against the inevitable creative fatigue incurred after a decade of multiplex dominance."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"Impressively, Waititi manages to retain his unique brand of humour while fulfilling his obligations to the franchise with Thor: Ragnarok."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"The greatest trick this studio wants to pull, at this point, is to make more of the same feel either exhilaratingly fresh, or sufficiently retro-inflected to qualify as a nostalgia trip. As both, Thor: Ragnarok counts as some kind of double peak."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"The relatively laidback angle on all the murderous spree-ing gives Chris Hemsworth a chance to find the comic groove beneath the title character's beefcake godliness. He does it expertly, and the self-mocking humor is all the more welcome given Thor's essential blandness."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"Daft as a badger sandwich and twice as funny, this is vintage Waititi, and the boldest, most outrageously fun film Marvel has yet produced."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,78,"Despite the notable camp value of Blanchett channeling Gloria Swanson, Cruella de Vil, and an extraterrestrial succulent plant, the doomy villain thing is rote."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,78,"It’s not hard to imagine a young audience completely losing their minds over the thrills and action of Thor: Ragnarok, and then loving it all over again when they realize how funny it is."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,77,"A goofy, kitschy- but- fun romp and the most purely entertaining of the three Thor movies, marked by its distinctive designs, ‘80s synth score, and assemblage of spirited characters. It’s carried by the excellent chemistry between Thor, Hulk, and Valkyrie, who give humanity to a visual effects-heavy spectacle that finally makes good on Thor’s title of God of Thunder."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"Waititi emerges triumphant, but it’s a nail-biter."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,Thor films have traditionally landed with a heavy foot. Thank goodness Waititi taught the big guy how to dance.
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"One of the silliest and least substantial of recent comic-book movies — a jokey, unapologetically nonsensical romp that makes “The Avengers” look like “The Godfather.”"
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"So it’s uneven, but the good stuff’s unusually lively and buoyant."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"This time it’s not too big. Thor: Ragnarok has a lot of human appeal and a spirit of silliness that it never loses and yet always carefully manages, so that the silliness remains an ongoing source of delight without ever undercutting the impact of the action."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"They’re called comic books for a reason too many superhero movies neglect. Not Thor: Ragnarok, one keenly aware of how silly all this universe saving stuff is. Guardians of the Galaxy is fun; this movie’s funny. There’s a difference."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"The fun here is in the little moments the actors find, and in the way that Waititi, within the massive machine that is a studio superhero movie, brings out a looseness and playfulness in the performances."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"Thor: Ragnarok, with its jabs of reportedly improvised banter, isn’t really an action movie. It’s a round-robin buddy comedy, mismatching Hemsworth’s amiable lug to characters old and new."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"This is a close-but-no-cigar movie, but so enjoyable for the most part, and so modest in its aims, that its disappointments aren’t devastating. I’d watch the first 90 minutes again anytime."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"It’s one of the most refreshing and satisfying Marvel movies in some time, precisely because its willing to do many things that Marvel hasn’t done before."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,The whole movie is a grab-bag of insanity so off-the-chain hilarious that you stick with it even when the convoluted plot goes haywire.
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"Even tonal issues can’t upend the magic this movie taps into putting Thor and Hulk together as new best buddies, whether they’re throwing down in an arena or having a bromantic heart-to-heart."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"Ragnarok is basically a Joke Delivery System — and on that score, it works. The movie is fun."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"Thor: Ragnarok doesn’t break fresh ground by Marvel standards, but it livens up the proceedings just enough to grease up the wheels of this franchise behemoth as it careens along."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,70,"The movie is fun enough, and Waititi shows enough moxie and goofy wit throughout, that instead of feeling glad that he’d been hired to direct the movie, I felt a little sad that he had to bother at all. Meaning: hopefully, Ragnarok will be a big hit and will write Waititi a blank check to do whatever flight of prickly whimsy he wants to do next. For that, it was probably all worth it."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,70,"Marvel could have gone grimmer, broodier and sterner, but that isn’t its onscreen way; so it has made Thor sunnier, sillier and funnier. It’s a good fit, at least for a while."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,70,"This is a very funny, perfectly scored...exciting, albeit overlong exercise in pushing MCU boundaries to their franchise breaking point."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,70,"This movie is so colorful and zippy and packed with outlandish supporting characters, that Hemsworth’s job is relatively easy. He just needs to look great, kick ass, nail the one-liners, and ride off into the sunset (or Avengers: Infinity War, whichever comes first). Thor: Ragnarok is sort of like a giant flatscreen TV hanging on a wall with an enormous hole in the middle of it. The TV is beautiful, but it doesn’t fix the hole. It just covers it up."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,67,"In this landscape, it’s rare to get the kind of unabashed silliness Taika Waititi delivers with Thor: Ragnarok."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,67,"It’s brassy, breezy and gut-bustingly fun; unfortunately, it’s at the expense of the film’s drama and pathos."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,63,"It appears that Marvel has given up trying to broaden the tent. Although Thor: Ragnarok, the third film to focus on the exploits of the titular Norse God, boasts a lighter tone, when the flippancy is stripped away, it’s the same-ole-same-ole."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,63,"Thor’s bloodsport detour diverts an inordinate amount of the filmmakers’ attention, and ours, from the whole end-of-days buildup. Hopkins gets short shrift, as does Idris Elba’s returning interdimensional gatekeeper, Heimdall."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,63,Thor: Ragnarok is the flamboyantly roller-disco entry in an already uncomplicatedly cartoonish side franchise.
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,63,"It’s even dumber than the earlier installments, but it knows it. And the result is some good, clean kid-friendly fun, save for the odd profanity — Odin is known for his curses, after all. Even the killing seems to lack fatal finality."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,60,"An excess of levity can quickly become its own kind of leadenness, and for long stretches between its genuinely amusing gags and set pieces, Thor: Ragnarok, credited to the screenwriting trio of Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost, is a bit too taken with its own breezy irreverence to realize when it’s time to rein it in."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,60,"Comic book movies have spent a long time striving to be taken as serious, grown-up entertainment but Thor: Ragnarok is almost an admission that you can’t play this material straight. This is probably the wisest strategy with Thor."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,40,"Directed by the enormously talented New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi, it’s well intentioned but ultimately numbing, an instance of fun overkill whose ultimate goal seems to be to put us into a special-effects coma."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,40,"While it’s not saying much, Thor: Ragnarok is easily the best of the three Thor movies — or maybe I just think so because its screenwriters and I finally seem to agree on one thing: The Thor movies are preposterous."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,"Despite the very real threat and the personal stakes and the grim weight given to things, director Sam Mendes manages to pay sophisticated, sincere homage to the conventions that define the Bond series while remembering that one of the things that makes the series such an enduring presence is fun."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,"Skyfall triumphantly reinvents 007 in one of the best Bonds ever. This is a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon, with Daniel Craig taking full possession of a role he previously played unconvincingly. I don't know what I expected in Bond No. 23, but certainly not an experience this invigorating."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,The movie's assured direction by Sam Mendes can't be underestimated.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,"The third starring the totally captivating cool cucumber Daniel Craig as Agent 007 - is both an elegy and a mission statement. It's also a great, long-lasting jolt of pleasure."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,The Daniel Craig era comes of age with a ballsy Bond that takes brave chances and bold risks. Guess what? Turns out you can teach an old dog new tricks.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,"Putting the ""intelligence"" in MI6, Skyfall reps a smart, savvy and incredibly satisfying addition to the 007 oeuvre, one that places Judi Dench's M at the center of the action."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,91,"He's 9Mendes) discovered his stride here, a blend of thrills and sabotage and deep-dish emotionalism. The powerful performances by Craig and Dench surely owe a great deal to his indulgences."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,91,"Skyfall doesn't forget it has to be an exciting spy film above all, but from its first scene, it ratchets up the drama in ways that have little to do with action."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,90,"The great success for Mendes and Craig, however, is that while Skyfall obviously has a great fondness for the past, it's not trapped there. It also anticipates Bond's future. In this immensely satisfying movie, so do we."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,90,"Skyfall is a push-pull between the past and the present, an effort to drag a symbol of maleness as iconic as the Union Jack bulldog on M's desk into a world of approximate gender equality and approximate acceptance of sexual difference. I'm not sure how sustainable that is over the long term; this is a smashing entertainment, but also one that feels over-engineered and constrained by its origins."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,90,"We need 007, even after half a century of his ups and downs in various incarnations, to remind us how deeply pleasurable an action thriller can be. The latest addition to the Bond canon goes beyond thrilling into chilling and enthralling, plus a kind of stirring that has nothing to do with martinis."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,90,"The stars and the explosions are backed up by plenty of class - Ralph Fiennes as M's new boss, Naomie Harris and Berenice Marlohe as a couple of the requisite Bond beauties, and Judi Dench finally given the space to turn M into a full-bodied character."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,90,"Dramatically gripping while still brandishing a droll undercurrent of humor, this beautifully made film will certainly be embraced as one of the best Bonds by loyal fans worldwide and leaves you wanting the next one to turn up sooner than four years from now."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"Skyfall is far and away the best, and the most British of the Daniel Craig-James Bond movies."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,Mendes' approach to action is classical and elegant - no manic editing and blurry unintelligible images here - but what makes the movie truly special is the attention he gives his actors.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"With a powerful jolt, 007 feels relevant again, with serious questions about espionage vs. cyber hacking amid the fun."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"Ultimately Skyfall is rooted in tradition - and in British soil. A pastoral drive to Bond's boyhood home (in a kind of car that will delight purists) opens the gates to some psychological background, and given the true-love subtext of ""Casino Royale,"" it's not surprising that there's an emotional payoff here."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"Best of all, we finally learn something about Bond's origins: The movie takes its title from his ancestral home in Scotland. (A nod to Connery, perhaps?)"
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"This is Bond like you've never seen him, almost Freudian in his vulnerability. And a dynamite Daniel Craig, never better in the role, nails Bond's ferocity and feeling."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"While the protracted third act doesn't kill the two-hour, 23-minute picture, ""Casino Royale"" remains the best of the recent Bonds, with Skyfall just a notch below it."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"Skyfall can take its place alongside ""From Russia with Love,"" ""Goldfinger,"" and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" as the best Bond can offer."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,Skyfall is one of the best Bonds in the 50-year history of moviedom's most successful franchise.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"Bond's latest is a remarkable high watermark for the series: at once solemn and deeply funny, sexy and sad, self-conscious without all the rib-bruising elbowing."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,85,"Working with the great cinematographer Roger Deakins, Mendes also presents some stunning sequences of beauty in a film where you might not expect such a thing."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,83,"Best of all is the bad guy. Javier Bardem was always a tantalizing choice to play a Bond villain, and his Silva is a terrific creation, and certainly the most memorable villain in the series in decades."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Mendes...lets the quieter moments breathe.... But Mendes is rather good at being loud, too, and his nine times Oscar-nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins makes the wildly ambitious action sequences the most beautiful in Bond’s 50-year career."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Skyfall is a highly distinctive Bond movie. It has some stunning visual touches.... Also, it mostly manages to convince us that there’s something at stake by giving a hint of Bond’s emotional life beyond this story."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Skyfall drips in the legacy of Bond, standing tall as an action-packed swansong to Britain's best loved hero of recent years, whilst also showing a great deal of affection for the decades of movies that have come before."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"In Skyfall, Mendes has given us a thrilling new chapter in a franchise that by all rights should have been gasping for air - which really makes him the hero of this saga."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"As Bond sprints from peril to pleasure, Mr. Craig and the other players - including an exceptional, wittily venal Javier Bardem, a sleek Ralph Fiennes and a likable Ben Whishaw - turn out to be the most spectacular of Mr. Mendes's special effects."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Skyfall has the feel of both a ceremonial commemoration and a franchise-rebooting celebration, especially in the ways it attempts to too cutely sync up the '60s-era Bond mythos (casual misogyny and all) with the more complicatedly ""Bourne""-inflected recent episodes."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"It's an unusually funny, literate, worked-out script, and Mendes seems hell-bent on making the best Bond since ""Goldfinger"" - or the best, period, given that he exhumes Bond's old Aston Martin only to shoot it cheekily to pieces."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Though a notch below ""Royale,"" Skyfall follows that reboot's lead, making a now 50-year-old icon as cool as when he began."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Skyfall is pretty much all you could want from a 21st Century Bond: cool but not camp, respectful of tradition but up to the moment, serious in its thrills and relatively complex in its characters but with the sense of fun that hasn't always been evident lately."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,75,"Skyfall is a different kind of Bond movie, one that works just fine on its own terms, but a steady diet of this might kill the franchise. One Skyfall is enough."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,75,"From the first smoky notes of a theme song sung by Adele, it's clear that Skyfall will be both classic and of-the-moment."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,75,"With gadgets, girls and globe-trotting held to a minimum, Skyfall, could, for long stretches, be mistaken for just another 21st-century thriller, albeit a well-made and intelligent one."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,75,Skyfall is certainly the most cultured Bond film to come along in some time. It's also the first of the three Craig endeavors to seriously (and wittily) acknowledge its pedigree.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,75,"Bond is back, and so is high-octane entertainment."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,70,"While trading on viewers’ familiarity with the series’ venerable fetishes (a cheer rises at the sight of Bond’s old Aston Martin and the sound of Monty Norman’s guitar theme from Dr. No), Skyfall has the life, grandeur and gravity of a satisfying, stand-alone entertainment."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,70,"As much as it's open about its paranoia of the new, Skyfall's fatal misstep is its slavish hewing to event-movie trends. Like this summer's Spider-Man, Batman, and Avengers movies, Skyfall seems to exist primarily to set up the events of subsequent films."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,67,"What's in a name? Lately, less and less. With Daniel Craig's third go at 007, I'm not sure there's much left that distinguishes Bond from Bourne from Batman. They're all slurping from the same soup – think: death-haunted, self-righteous, tight-lipped and -quipped, parkour enthusiast."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,60,Skyfall leaves you wondering whether this incarnation of the character has anywhere left to go. It's the portrait of a spy at the end of his rope by an actor who seems close to his.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,60,"The sky is far from falling on the Bond franchise. In fact, it is as good as it has ever been. What's more, Craig is reportedly on board for at least two more outings, so Q had better get to work on those bifocals because 007 is no where near ready for retirement."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,60,"While director Sam Mendes, aided and abetted by a crack technical team, delivers big-screen action with panache and style, something about this Bond feels a little off."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,60,All of which works terrifically well up to a point.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,60,These are truly tedious stakes for an action movie. The franchise isn't worried about world safety. It's fretting over whether to start wearing Depends.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,50,"In the utterly routine effort Skyfall, we're actually expected to cheer each chord we've heard so many times (here's a martini shaker! Look, it's a Walther PPK! And there's an Aston Martin!) We've been turned into wretched Pavlovian dogs, salivating at the bell instead of the snack. The highlight, by far, is a classic animated credit sequence: Adele, you are the new Shirley Bassey."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,100,Man of Steel is more than just Avengers-sized escapism; it's an artistic introduction to a movie superhero we only thought we knew.
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,87,"If the word “epic” has lost its meaning in the throes of recent summers, Man of Steel forcefully redefines it."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,80,"Feels both modern and traditional – a halfway house between the broodier Nolan way of shaking things up and the louder, bone-crunching style that director Zack Snyder established with films such as ‘300’ and ‘Sucker Punch’. Man of Steel is punchy, engaging and fun, even if it slips into a final 45 minutes of explosions and fights during which reason starts to vanish and the science gets muddy."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,80,"It aches for more depth and warmth and humour, but this is spectacular sci-fi — huge, operatic, melodramatic, impressive. It feels the right Superman origin story for our era, and teases what would be a welcome new superfranchise."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,80,"A bracing attempt to bring the legend back into contention that successfully separates itself from other Super-movies but misses some of their warmth and charm. But given the craft and class, this could be the start of something special"
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,The most striking and curious aspect of Man of Steel is the way it minimizes and even shuts out women.
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,"David Goyer, who wrote the script for Man of Steel from a story he concocted with Christopher Nolan, found a new way to make us care: The title character is disturbed by everything in his adopted home."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,"Man of Steel is, first and foremost, a great spectacle."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,"Caught in the slipstream between action and angst, Man of Steel is a bumpy ride for sure. But there's no way to stay blind to its wonders."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,"Deploying an impeccable American accent, Brit Henry Cavill may be as charming as the late great Christopher Reeve."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,"Goyer and Nolan have crafted in Man of Steel a taut, exploratory vision, and Snyder's later inheritance of the material indeed proves his best work since “Dawn of the Dead.”"
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,"The action is plentiful and thumping; Marvel-size thrills await you and the generations of kids who still believe in Superman. I just mean that the movie finds its true, lofty footing not when it displays Kal-El’s extraordinary powers but when it dramatizes Clark Kent’s roiling humanity. The super part of Man of Steel is just O.K.; but the man part is super."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,70,"If you like your summer-movie explosions huge, Man of Steel delivers. But it seems as if it might have delivered even more than a glorious noise."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,70,"As much spectacle and action — minute-by-minute, frame-by-frame — as any movie anyone could think of. Zack Snyder’s huge, backstory-heavy extravaganza is a rehab job that perhaps didn’t cry out to be done but proves so overwhelmingly insistent in its size and strength that it’s hard not to give in."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,70,"Snyder has cast Man of Steel with dramatic actors, not action stars, and it pays off."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,67,"Here are a few adjectives that do not apply to the new Superman movie: Beguiling. Frisky. Nuanced. Quiet. Even the title, Man of Steel, sounds too flighty for this film. Man of Lead, or Man of Plutonium, maybe."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,63,"The story, while sometimes soaring, is other times grounded by a hyperactive and numbing vibe. But Henry Cavill has the strapping good looks of the comic icon, and humanity to match his superheroism."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,63,"Snyder films the violence in Man of Steel the way he films most of the rest of the picture: Like a man chasing tornadoes and not even trying to keep subjects in frame. It's a choice, and not a bad one, necessarily — the Smallville farm scenes, in particular, respond well to the approach — but by the end it's a visually limiting one."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,63,"Snyder knows how to put on a show, and Man of Steel has a massive scope that’s hard to resist... But what’s missing from this Superman saga is a sense of lightness, of pop joy."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,63,"What it fails to supply much of — surprisingly, it must be said — is fun. This is serious business, Snyder seems always to be saying. This is badass. And given the sheer logistical size of the spectacle on display, it's a position that's hard to argue with."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"At once frantically overblown and beautifully filigreed, Man of Steel will turn on everyone it doesn’t turn off."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"The serious-minded result has many super-cool moments. But when it gets clunky, it’s super-meh."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"It has heft, it looks amazing, and it's businesslike to a fault."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"It’s a relief just to watch the actors act once in a while, and thankfully, Snyder is astute enough to punch some breathing holes in this steel-clad colossus."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"The whole film ends up feeling weighed down: though Man of Steel bounds from one epic setpiece to another, you're left with the nagging feeling that you just can't work out what the central twosome see in each other. And for Superman and Lois Lane, that's hardly ideal."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"Like Snyder’s Sucker Punch, it’s a confused but fascinating mishmash of religious, military, and sexual imagery."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,58,"While certainly the most dazzling Superman movie to hit the big screen, the 143-minute Man of Steel is also the longest, and it only justifies that heft because it leaves room to keep the effects coming."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,58,"If this version of Superman is to have a future — as Warner Brothers seems convinced he will, having already green-lit the sequel — I hope Snyder will dial back both the casualty count and the Krypton mythmaking and instead focus on establishing a fictional Earth that’s rich enough to be worth saving."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"Taking a cue from the “Batman” series, the film is dark and thudding and overlong."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"At least an hour of Man of Steel's excessive running time is devoted to the sort of crash-and-burn, slamming-into-skyscrapers CG fight scenes that we've already seen in ""The Avengers"" and ""Dark Knight,"" ""Iron Man,"" and ""Spider-Man.""
Man of Steel is just the same old same old."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,What went wrong with Man of Steel? The early teasers promised Terrence Malick. The finished film is more Michael Bay.
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"While its ambition and scope pull one way, its pinched and unconvincing sense of drama pull the other."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"The movie isn’t dead on arrival, like Snyder’s over-reverent ""Watchmen."" But it’s pleasure-free."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"Man of Steel has too many characters and too much plot, resulting in a movie that feels overstuffed and overlong."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"If every generation gets the Superman it deserves, Man of Steel suggests we’ve earned one utterly without wit or charm."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"A mostly underwhelming film, with underdeveloped characters and supercharged fight scenes that drag on forever and offer nothing new in the way of special-effects creativity."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,The local multiplex is lousy with celluloid crime fighters. So what turf is left for good old Clark Kent? That's the nagging question that director Zack Snyder's Man of Steel tries — and ultimately fails — to answer.
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"Redundant, unnecessary and a colossal waste of talent and money, you can pretty much sum up Man of Steel in the scene in which a lady police officer watches with her mouth wide open as Superman tosses aside tanks like Tinker Toys. “What are you smiling about, captain?” asks another cop. “Nothing, sir — I just think he’s hot.”"
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,Here's one more studio extravaganza brought down by numbing action and an addiction to generic digital effects.
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,40,"So we get no zippy, Tony Stark-flavored one-liners. No comic-relief characters. No nonsense. But that means we also get no up, up and away, either."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,40,"Despite looking, feeling and (especially) sounding expensive – this is one of the loudest summer spectacles of recent years – Man of Steel is second-tier and third-generation Chris Nolan-flavored neo-superhero material."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,40,"The better actors — Kevin Costner, chiefly, as the adoptive Earth father — strain to supply warmth, but mostly, the minutes stretch into great expanses of blahness, much of them filled with Transformers-grade skyscraper snapping and bloodless catastrophe."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,40,The humorless tone and relentlessly noisy (visually and sonically) aesthetics leave much to be desired.
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,40,"A soulless, overblown bore."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,38,"All its faux-patriotism isn't played for satire, but instead utilized to align the film with an idyllic, unquestioned vision of goodness."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,38,"Snyder tries to up the spectacle ante with ever more explosions, crashes, thermal blasts, topological realignments, gunfire and mano-a-mano fistfights. But the result is a punishing sense of diminishing returns and a genre that has finally reached the point of mayhem-induced exhaustion."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,100,"Most astonishingly, with the franchise's powerful climax, Lawrence has managed to align her parallel Hollywood lives and reinvent the prestigious popcorn flick, a crowd-pleaser with intelligent class."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,91,"This may be one of the most subversive blockbusters I can name, and I respect just how raw Francis Lawrence and his team play things. Even the ""action"" in the film is grim and painful and rarely thrilling."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,90,"What makes the material still feel personal — other than the yearslong investment and love that transform entertainments into fan communities — is the combination of Katniss and Ms. Lawrence, who have become a perfect fit."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,90,This is a film that dares to be about something while still delivering as a piece of straightforward entertainment.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,83,"Lawrence makes every moments as Katniss count, pouring out mixed feelings through puffy eyes."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,80,"The final film adaptation of Suzanne Collins’s dystopian Hunger Games YA novels, Mockingjay — Part 2, is a potent antiwar saga: bleak, savage, and very modern in the depiction of an unholy union between political manipulation and showbiz."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,80,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 2 is a dark film, in a dramatically satisfying way."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,80,"After the subterranean sluggishness of the last film, too thinly spun out from the first third of Suzanne Collins’s final book, Mockingjay – Part 2 returns the series to its characteristic high gear."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,80,"If anything, this is too faithful to the book, sometimes getting bogged down in detail as Katniss struggles to her goal. But its epic sweep, grand designs and unyielding central performance make this a compelling finale."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,80,Jennifer Lawrence shines once again in a fitting send-off for cinema’s best YA franchise. The hefty action and high stakes outweigh any shortcomings.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,80,"In the genuinely shocking and surprising third act, it wades deep into the moral shades of grey at the story's core and comes out the other side with no easy solution."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,80,"This might be the most downbeat blockbuster in memory, a film that starts out pitiless and goes downhill from there, save for a fleeting glimmer of hope in the final moments. It’s a bold statement about the unforgiving nature of war, unashamedly political in its motives and quietly devastating in its emotional effect."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,80,"Mockingjay — Part 2 proves to be the most satisfying, gripping and emotional film in the franchise, resolving Katniss Everdeen’s odyssey with tense action sequences and a well-earned poignancy."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,75,"“If we die, let it be for a cause, not a spectacle,” the heroine barks at one point. If such a statement sounds fairly insane coming from a series that has grossed (to date) $2.3 billion worldwide, Mockingjay — Part 2 is sturdy enough to render it moot while you’re watching. After that, it’s up to you whether to swallow the irony or choke on it."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,75,"The good news is that Mockingjay – Part 2, the big finale, has quit the ass-dragging in favor of what made the book a page-turner. There's the visual fireworks, for sure. But there's also the darkness of the theme."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,75,"An exciting, involving finale, streamlining the complicated end game of Collins’ story without shortchanging the climactic action."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,75,"Mockingjay — Part 2 is a grim, dark, trippy, violent and sometimes just plain bizarre journey, which makes for a fitting if uneven conclusion to a film series that’s always been weird."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,75,"Grim, relentless and immensely satisfying, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 sends out the dystopian sci-fi franchise on a feel-bad high. Readers of Suzanne Collins’ source novel, who already know what’s coming, will be pleased by the movie’s merciless fidelity to the source material (or perhaps, considering the book is the least popular in the trilogy, will just be annoyed all over again)."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,70,"Mockingjay Part 2 is a worthy conclusion to a series that’s meant so much to so many, made stars of its younger players and allowed more-established performers to shamelessly ham it up."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,70,"Katniss has remained, in Jennifer Lawrence’s portrayal, a vividly vulnerable creature of flesh and blood surrounded by sci-fi extravagance of variable quality."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,70,"One could argue that “Mockingjay” didn’t really merit being split in two (and surely a single three-hour movie could be made of it), but we benefit from the fact that the film has been given room to breathe, which allows for subtle character moments...and the gradual building of suspense during the actual siege in the Capitol."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,68,"As far as structure, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 has pretty much the same flaws as its source material. Freed from the confines of the literal arena from the first two books/movies, the overarching sequence of events seems ragged by comparison."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,67,"Director Francis Lawrence stages the action sequences, both aboveground and underground, with a modicum of flair, and Julianne Moore as rebel leader Coin gives off some sparks – she’s a reformer with a totalitarian streak – but for the most part there is nothing divertingly new or different about this franchise fade-out."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,67,"This concluding chapter is a solid culmination of a franchise that has had its ups and downs. Lawrence’s superb performance grounds the film, as she oscillates between badass archer and increasingly disenfranchised political pawn, and mercifully the late Hoffman’s CGI scenes are kept to a minimum."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,67,"Awash in a depressive shade of perpetual blue, Mockingjay—Part 2 out-Nolans Christopher Nolan in the race to see just how dark a PG-13 tentpole can get before the audience itself revolts."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,67,"With its political power struggles and prodigious body count, all rendered in a thousand shades of wintry greige, the movie feels less like teen entertainment than a sort of Hunger Games of Thrones."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,63,"It is almost criminal, though, that the end of this otherwise game-changing franchise full of bloodthirsty and complex women concludes on a painfully trite note – the strides made by all four films are undercut by Part 2’s underwhelming and hokey epilogue."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,63,"Mockingjay Part 1, released a year ago, was a disjointed, incomplete affair and, although Mockingjay Part 2 is more polished, the pace is uneven and there’s a sense that the series has hung around too long."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,63,"If Mockingjay - Part 1 was walkier and talkier than its forerunners, Part 2 is pretty much all action - and lesser for it."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,63,"Most of the pleasure of Mockingjay — Part 2 comes from watching Lawrence, not the story around her. Her aim is true, even if the narrative arc of the movie traces a long, wobbly path toward its eventual, and not exactly happy, resting place."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,63,"It has the best action sequences of all four chapters, though its revolutionary message gets bogged down by a meandering plot and some good old-fashioned overacting."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,63,The Hunger Games has completed its tasks well and met fan expectations.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,60,"The pace, which had been so tightly controlled in the first two films, is a curious mess, starting off painfully slowly, then rushing when it really matters."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,60,"This is a dish that has been prepared over a low heat for a long time, which makes for some pretty slow-going early on."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,58,"Lawrence is never less than commanding in her last outing as the fiery dystopian heroine, but the most heartening liberation proffered by Part 2 is its star’s escape from this one-note fantasy series."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,50,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 has the technical polish and competent acting of the four-film series, though less intensity. It contains no surprises and ends with an anticlimax I have heard is faithful to the book, though it doesn’t amount to much onscreen."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,50,"That ""The Hunger Games"" movies lost momentum is hardly a surprise: even ""Star Wars"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" slipped after the second installment. The end feels like a relief for all concerned, and it does feel like the end."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,50,"The third and weakest book in Suzanne Collins’ trilogy should never have been split into two films, but since that’s become money-grubbing standard
practice for young-adult adaptations (“Twilight,” “Divergent”), here we are."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,50,"The result is a reminder that, with weak material, it’s often worse to have a really good actor. The weaknesses just stands out in sharper relief."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,50,"It’s also true that toward the end of a big series the story eats the stars, and everybody in this movie, even Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, the Artemis-style revolutionary icon, is pretty much part of the furniture."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,50,The stakes are higher because this is the end—It really is this time!—but the first hour or so of returning director Francis Lawrence’s film is legitimately nap-inducing.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,50,"The aesthetically misguided idea of breaking the final book into two films, commercially remunerative though it might have been, has ended up making the dragged-out proceedings feel anti-climactic and emotionally static."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,40,"Give Lawrence credit for a seriously emotional performance, at least, and thanks to supporting actors Moore, Sutherland and a sly Woody Harrelson for adding color and comedy."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,38,It careens from carnage to group therapy so wildly that the action never gets to build and the conversations just repeat themselves.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,38,"Mockingjay II is a bare bones finale — a tedious two hours in which nothing at all happens, with the briefest of breaks for a zombie chase and attack and a half-hearted bit of sci-fi combat."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,100,"Not just a reboot - it's a rejuvenation. From the first image of sensory awakening to the final acceptance of adult responsibility, it pulses with the warm blood of a very human hero."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,91,"What's most amazing in The Amazing Spider-Man turns out to be not the shared sensations of blockbuster wow! the picture elicits, but rather the shared satisfactions of intimate awww."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,88,Did we need another Spider-Man this quickly? Debatable. But if you wanted a new interpretation – especially one where story and action stay in the right balance – this is it.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,88,"This is a more thoughtful film, and its action scenes are easier to follow in space and time. If we didn't really need to be told Spidey's origin story again, at least it's done with more detail and provides better reasons for why Peter Parker throws himself into his superhero role."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,80,"This fourth installment is a complete reboot, returning to the web-slinger's creation story, and Garfield, more than any other factor, contributes to the sense of a bleaker vision along the lines of ""The Dark Knight."""
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,80,"None of this is new to us, but Garfield and Webb make it feel convincingly fresh and exciting."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,80,"Director Marc Webb's action-adventure is grounded in a recognizable reality, but is also full of thrills. It's dark and mysterious, but doesn't skimp on fun."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,80,"The film is also faithful to the smartassery of the Spider-Man of the comics, and Garfield's spindly physicality evokes the Marvel illustrations of the 1960s."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,80,Meet the new face of superheroes: Marc Webb's totally teenage and totally fun take on the Spider-Man franchise.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,80,"A mostly slick, entertaining and emotionally involving recombination of fresh and familiar elements."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,80,"While the two leads deliver the goods and manage to combine a frisky sense of first love with the movie's gloomier arc, they are well-served by a terrific supporting cast."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,80,"It isn't perfect but this reboot's wins outweigh its wobbles. The leads charm, the action crackles and the grooves are well-laid for part two. Untold story? Next time, then."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,80,It's the successul synthesis of the two – action and emotion – that means this Spider-Man is as enjoyable as it is impressive: Webb's control of mood and texture is near faultless as his film switches from teenage sulks to exhilarating airborne pyrotechnics.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,75,"The Amazing Spider-Man is fun, as any summer movie amusement ride can be. But it left me feeling the same as Raimi's version; that groundwork has been dutifully laid for a winning franchise in need of a few surprises."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,75,"This is the second-best Spider-Man movie yet made. In the previous trilogy, only ""Spider-Man 2"" surpasses it."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,75,The whiz-bang stuff doesn't kick in until the Peter-Gwen relationship (which is the best thing in the movie) is firmly established.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,75,"More honourable than ""amazing,"" the latest reboot of the Spider-man franchise brings Marvel Comics web-slinging super-hero down to earth, in a mostly satisfactory way."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,75,"As a new chapter in the superpowered arachnid saga, it stands on its own quite nicely, focusing more on human emotions than on a panoply of special effects."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,75,"When a new actor slips on the Spandex for a superhero franchise reboot, we should, you know, notice. And we do with Andrew Garfield."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,75,Part of the reason The Amazing Spider-Man feels so fresh and invigorating is that its story is so simple - anyone remember exactly what the deal was with Loki and that cube? - and its protagonist so relatable.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,70,This might be a fun summer blockbuster if only it even remotely needed to exist.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,70,Pretty good summer flick!
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,70,Probably not as good as you hoped or as bad as you feared.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,70,Watching Garfield swinging through New York or toying with criminals after he captures them is reason enough to welcome another telling of the tale.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,70,"I've saved the best for last: The love interest played by that throaty redheaded (here blonde) darling Emma Stone, whose blue eyes radiate so much intelligence that any actor on whom she trains them in adoration becomes an instant movie star."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,67,"The Amazing Spider-Man is agreeable.  And occasionally it's more.  But, as with the American remake of the Swedish film of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" you can't help but feel that you've not only heard the story before, but that you you've seen it before, too -- and recently."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,63,Don't come to The Amazing-Spider-Man looking for originality.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,63,"The good news is that Garfield and Stone whip up a warm, convincing froth as two teenagers caught up in a beguiling case of puppy love. The not-so-great news is that by ""reboot,"" the studio means taking audiences once again through every step of Peter's transformation into Spider-Man."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,63,"Webb never loses touch with the film's emotional through line. And he allows time and space for Garfield and Stone, both stellar, to turn a high-flying adventure into something impassioned and moving. A Spider-Man that touches the heart. Now that really is amazing."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,60,"On the whole, it's passable stuff, a surprise, given how mechanical the masked character seemed."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,60,"Mr. Webb's Spider-Man movie works only because he keeps the whole package, at least until the requisite final blowout, tethered to his two appealing leads."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,60,"The problem is that the film must re-establish a great deal of mythology, much of which is already familiar to most moviegoers. Unfortunately, Webb's film never quite makes usshake the feeling that we've done all this before."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,60,There are joyous moments when we share Peter's point of aerial view.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,60,"The result is that ""Spider-Man"" goes in and out of focus. This is a film that is memorable in pieces but not as a whole."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,60,"Graced with great performances from Garfield and Stone, The Amazing Spider-Man is a rare comic-book flick that is better at examining relationships than superheroism. If it doesn't approach the current benchmark of Avengers Assemble, it still delivers a different enough, enjoyable origin story to live comfortably alongside the Raimi era."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,50,"The Amazing Spider-Man, helmed by ""(500) Days Of Summer"" director Marc Webb, doesn't put its own stamp on the material, which feels warmed-over in ways that don't help."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,50,"For me, this is as deflating a movie as I have seen all year. Not the worst, to be sure, but a project so utterly unnecessary that it made me want to gnash my teeth in frustration."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,50,"Sometimes dull and mostly uninspired, it's much less a satisfying reboot like ""Batman Begins'' than a pointless rehash in the mode of ""Superman Returns.''"
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,50,"No mutation is necessary to clearly see that Marvel's ""reboot"" of their signature franchise is an unimaginative remake of Sam Raimi's 2002 Spider-Man."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,40,"This hugely elaborate production is supposed to be the reboot of a foundering franchise, but rebooting a computer wipes the silicon slate clean. In the movie, what's old is old again."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,38,"Dumbed down, tarted up, and almost shockingly uninspired, it's the worst superhero movie since ""Green Lantern."""
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,262030663,30,"In short, the character is a lot like the way Stan Lee first envisioned him, but the trilogy's screenwriter Steve Ditko would probably loathe this new, unsatisfying, and hollow-feeling entry into the new cinematic Marvel Universe."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,91,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a tremendous piece of pop entertainment, smart and engaging and featuring a home run movie star lead performance by Chris Evans."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,88,"In his third outing as the Captain, Evans seems totally comfortable in the role. He manages to convey his character’s goodness without making him seem like a self-righteous stiff. There’s an ease in his performance, and a sense of humor that makes him very appealing."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,88,What it comes down to is the difference between spectacle and craftsmanship. The Winter Soldier has plenty of the former – every dollar of its estimated $170-million (U.S.) budget is onscreen – but it’s also got an intricate dramatic and thematic structure holding everything in place.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,88,"The rare film in this genre that serves as both entry point and continuation. For a change, you can walk in cold and you won't be too lost."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,88,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier neatly and entertainingly puts into motion some big changes in the Marvel universe, while still sticking to its own charms — no easy feat, but one fit for a hero."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,88,"Co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo and the team of screenwriters have fashioned a story with just the right balance of superhero fun, nods to the greater Marvel Universe and genuine dramatic tension."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,86,"The newest Marvel blockbuster-to-be boasts an array of well-cast leads and supporting characters; a crisply paced, sensible plot; and above-average dialogue. Even more importantly, every scene and every character interaction prove that the movie’s creative team truly understands the core appeal of Cap himself—the tone of not just the character, but the comic book series from which he springs."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,83,"By far the best Part Two in the universe (not necessarily hard to achieve) it also rests at the franchise’s peak alongside Iron Man, Avengers, and its predecessor to show the viability of cinematic serials."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,83,"This sequel is, by design, entirely absorbing and satisfying without being one whit memorable."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,83,"The best Marvel film since ""The Avengers."""
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,83,The creators of Captain America: The Winter ­Soldier have brought off something fresh and bold.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,83,"Despite some of its more rickety story elements, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is possibly the studio's best action film and the one most able to stand on its own since the original ""Iron Man."""
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"This entry won't win any new converts, but anyone already invested in this series is going to have a blast."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"What makes ""The Winter Soldier"" so enjoyable, though, and what will make it so profitable, is its emotional bandwidth — all the vivid, nuanced life lived by its characters in between their frenzied escapades."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,Steve and the movie still fly high through plot twists and cool stunts.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"Count Captain America: The Winter Soldier as another success in the Marvel line. Thanks to the chemistry between Evans and Johansson and a willingness to shake things up, it's more than just a placeholder between ""Avenger"" films."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"The script is solid, and the fight scenes are excellent."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"Parents, take note: For all its heart, this is a tougher, more morally complex movie than its predecessors. Young kids carrying their miniversions of Cap’s famous shield may be in for a jolt."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"This installment delivers a heavy and welcome dose of paranoia, administered between fleetly paced smackdowns."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"It may climax with an overly formulaic splurge, but The Winter Soldier benefits from an old-school-thriller tone that, for its first half at least, distinguishes it from its more obviously superheroic Marvel cousins."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"In the first movie, an injection transformed wimpy Steve Rogers into strapping Captain America; similarly, this sequel gives the flagging comic-book movie an adrenaline shot of relevance. You've got to hand it to them."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"With a string of gratifying action sequences, and a breakneck pace leavened by a frequently witty script, The Winter Soldier stands alone as a solidly entertaining blockbuster."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"If we must endure yet another spring-summer cycle of comic book superheroes, this movie at least delivers the wham-bang goods (recycled though they may be)."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"It tells its own story and, unlike with ""Thor 2"" and ""Iron Man 3,"" we don't feel the absence of the rest of the team."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,An often breathlessly exciting action thriller told with humor and intelligence.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"The new film isn’t nearly as bleak as Christopher Nolan’s take on Batman (in general, Marvel seems more risk-averse when it comes to fiddling with the crown jewels), but it still creates an action-movie landscape torn between patriotic ideals and harsh post-9/11 realpolitik."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"The movie does its duty. It's a reliable commodity, delivered efficiently and well, like pizza."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is every rousing, whup-ass thing you want in an escapist adventure."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"A baggy, at times brutal conglomeration of surprisingly deep character development and aggressively percussive action, The Winter Soldier is a comic-book movie only in its provenance."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"It's a heady blend, at times requiring more speechifying than throwaway pop deserves. But it keeps one guessing between ill-staged and frenetically edited fight scenes. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo handle vehicular mayhem better."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,70,"Beneath the expensive, computer-generated busyness of this second Captain America installment is a bracing, old-style conspiracy thriller made extra-scary by new technology and the increasingly ugly trade-offs of a post-9/11 world."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,70,"It needs to seem cool enough that we want to watch it despite its obvious silliness, and viewed through that prism of canny analysis, the craftsmanship of “Winter Soldier” is first rate."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,70,"Arriving in the middle of Phase Two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, The Winter Soldier is among the best of the nine films released so far—roughly on par with the first Iron Man and The Avengers—but if the film has one major flaw, it’s the obligation to serve a larger franchise that keeps taking on weight."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,70,"For sheer plotting and audience involvement, this is a notch above any of the other Avengers-feeding Marvel entries, the one that feels most like a real movie rather than a production line of ooh-and-ahh moments for fanboys."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,70,It’s to the credit of the Russos that they give the characters such room to breathe in a movie that easily might have been about rushing from one gargantuan setpiece to the next.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,67,"At over two hours, The Winter Soldier could have easily been trimmed by a good 20 minutes, but if it’s spectacular imagery and duplicitous goings-on that you crave, the film will not disappoint."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,67,"The Winter Soldier is probably in the upper tier of Marvel pictures in terms of quality, but ultimately proves too muddled and frantic to match the heights of ""The Avengers."""
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,63,"The problem with Captain America: The Winter Soldier is that there's too much going on: the Marvel Universe stuff, the WikiLeaks-ish paranoia stuff, the video game-ish CG visual effects stuff, the epic John Woo-ish everybody-pointing-a-weapon-at-everybody-else face-off stuff."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,63,"With his glorified Frisbee and good-guy smile, Evans is engaging, but “The Winter Soldier” might be stronger with a little less Captain and a little more America."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,63,"It’s OK for April, in other words, but not up to the higher standards of a Marvel summer blockbuster."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,60,So here's what moviegoers can trust from the Russo's Captain America: Winter Solider: They can trust it to be a brisk ride. They can trust it to be entertaining. They can expect it to be suspenseful.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,60,"You can’t help but feel disappointed that a film with a relatively spicy premise becomes, in the end, so risk-averse."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,50,"Given how little creative wiggle room there is in properties like The Winter Soldier, it’s a minor triumph that the Russos imprint any personality on the movie, which is less a stand-alone work than a part of an ever-expanding multimedia enterprise."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,50,"The most memorable element of The Winter Soldier, besides Redford, is probably Scarlett Johansson, whose dryly funny Natasha at times comes perilously close to being … a well-developed female character?"
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,50,"Has the usual overlong running time, the half-hearted feints in the direction of human feeling and the obligatory action sequences that are big without being either exciting or particularly legible."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,50,"It's a product of the highest quality, but at the end of the day that's what it is: a machine-made, assembly-line product whose strengths tend to feel like items checked off a master list rather than being the result of any kind of individual creative touch."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,50,Deeply mediocre and ultra-predictable.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,38,"Despite one or two moments of Venture Brothers-worthy fancy, the film is as by-the-numbers as any this series has ever offered."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"A clever, vividly imagined, consistently funny, eye-poppingly pretty and oddly profound movie … about Legos."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"Everything in The Lego Movie is, indeed, awesome."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"The LEGO Movie is the kind of animated free-for-all that comes around very rarely, if ever: A kids’ movie that matches shameless fun with razor-sharp wit, that offers up a spectacle of pure, freewheeling joy even as it tackles the thorniest of issues."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"The movie is a wonderful surprise, cleverly written and executed brick by brick with a visual panache."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"The funniest, cleverest, most exhaustingly exhilarating animated feature in ages."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,The jokes fly at a pace demanding viewers to either refrain from laughing (highly unlikely) or see The Lego Movie again to catch all the wondrous sights and amiable wit sliding by the first time.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,It's hard to think of the last time a Pixar film made you go ''Wow!'' That's part of why The LEGO Movie is such outrageous and intoxicating fun.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,Finally! A comedy that works.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"The Lego Movie is an absolute blast—a whip-smart, surprisingly emotional family film where the toy property is seen less as a concrete template than a tool for seemingly limitless potential."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"It’s a non-stop blast from beginning to end, jam-packed with a wacky irreverence, dazzling state-of-the-art CGI (courtesy of Animal Logic) and a pitch-perfect voice cast headed by Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks and Will Ferrell."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,91,"Beautifully shot, impeccably paced, and with a voice cast that nails it in every role, large or small, ""The Lego Movie"" is a genuine delight."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,91,"Like the toy it's based on, it's goofy and colorful and something adults and children can enjoy together."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,90,"Fast-paced, often hilarious fun and involves an imaginative and deeply weird use of cutting-edge digital animation."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,90,"The Lego Movie is strikingly, exhilaratingly, exhaustingly fresh."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,90,"The Lego Movie is a delight, a funny, fast-moving film that should satisfy adults and children alike."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,90,"Lord and Miller do great work within constraints, taking pre-made pieces and fashioning them into feats worthy of applause. It's no wonder they made a Lego movie — and it's no wonder it's so good."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,This is truly a movie that children and their parents can both enjoy for different reasons.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,"A wickedly smart and funny free-for-all, and sassy enough to shoot well-aimed darts at corporate branding."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,A marvelous piece of work.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,"There are so many things to like about The Lego Movie: a great voice cast, clever dialogue and a handsome blend of stop-motion and CGI animation that feels lovingly retro, while still looking sharp in 21st-century 3-D. But the best thing about this movie... is its subversive nature."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,The first great cinematic experience of 2014.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,"The visuals are spectacular, the 3D technology is artfully used and the storyline is jam-packed with so many funny lines, it’s hard to catch all the jokes that are delivered in rapid-fire succession."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,83,"Just plain funny, loaded with joke after joke and pun after pun."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,83,"Effervescent in style, conveying a substantive message without ever devolving into saccharine preachiness."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,An unexpected joy.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"The Lego Movie maybe be one giant advertisement, but all the way to its plastic-mat foundation, it's an earnest piece of work — a cash grab with a heart. Made for, with and about Legos, the movie is also made for, with and about imagination, and when that association seems completely natural, it's a win all around."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"For a film that clearly required a small army to make, it often feels thrillingly off-the-cuff, which keeps with The Lego Movie’s themes of creativity and weirdness: Nobody’s following an instruction book with this one."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"The LEGO Movie is sheer joy: the script is witty, the satire surprisingly pointed and the animation tactile and imaginative."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"Ridiculously funny and meticulously detailed, The LEGO Movie is far better than a toy tie-in movie has any right to be. Despite a couple of dips, you’ll be grinning throughout."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,The Lego Movie is bursting out of its box with enthusiasm and excitement for the possibilities of a little pile of nubby plastic.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"For a shot of pure forward-leaping, backward-dreaming animated pleasure, pick brick."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"Phil Lord and Christopher Miller irreverently deconstruct the state of the modern blockbuster and deliver a smarter, more satisfying experience in its place, emerging with a fresh franchise for others to build upon."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,78,The film is one big advertisement for the multicolored building blocks from which it’s made. The Lego Movie may be the shrewdest marketing ploy you’ve ever seen.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,75,"No doubt, there is an uncomfortable number of logos being marketed to kids in the The Lego Movie, along with the obvious one that’s in the title, but the film as a whole is very much in the spirit of Cloud Cuckooland: It’s a place where the use of X-Acto blades and Krazy Glue breaks the rules but almost everything else goes."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,75,"The all-Lego adventure is warm and witty, showing flashes of satire."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,75,A manic and at times surprising comedy that has more imagination and creativity than all the Transformers pictures combined.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,75,The Lego Movie amuses and never fails to leave the viewer –especially adults — a little dazzled at the demented audacity of it all.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,63,"All told, there's an ageless warmth to The LEGO Movie akin to that of the LEGO brand itself."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,60,"As a rule, movies about toys need to be approached with extreme caution; some of them have been bad enough to count as health hazards. This one is the exception."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,60,The Lego Film has a specialness all its own. There's never been a hodgepodge quite like it.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,60,"As full-length toy advertisements go, you really couldn’t ask for more."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,60,"The visual environment created by the filmmakers (Phil Lord and Christopher Miller of “21 Jump Street” wrote and directed; the animation is by Animal Logic) hums with wit and imagination... The story is a busy, slapdash contraption designed above all to satisfy the imperatives of big-budget family entertainment."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,50,"As cute and energetic as it is, The Lego Movie is more exhausting than fun, too unsure of itself to stick with any story thread for too long. The action scenes are enthusiastic, colorful but uninvolving, like an 8-year-old emptying a bucket of plastic blocks."
Batman,7.6,251188924,100,"This Batman is a stunning achievement, especially through the incredible and unique visualization of director Tim Burton. The film may be disappointing to those expecting a campy cartoon, however, although the more dramatic stylization of this version is its strongest asset."
Batman,7.6,251188924,100,"The movie fixes you in its gravitational pull. It's an enveloping, walk-in vision... As rich and satisfying a movie as you're likely to see all year."
Batman,7.6,251188924,100,"In short, Batman is terrific - funny, smart and sensitive too, the perfect cinematic date."
Batman,7.6,251188924,100,The Batblast of the summer.
Batman,7.6,251188924,91,Jack Nicholson as The Joker helpfully provides all the colour.
Batman,7.6,251188924,88,"Nicholson embellishes fascinatingly baroque designs with his twisted features, lavish verbal pirouettes and inspired excursions into the outer limits of psychosis. It's a masterpiece of sinister comic acting."
Batman,7.6,251188924,80,Burton's direction rises to a Wagnerian hysteria (an impression backed by Danny Elfman`s roaring orchestral score) as the two mortal enemies fight it out on the brink of a zillion-foot drop. Burton achieves a genuine majesty at that moment-though he would need one or two more like it to make Batman a genuinely memorable film.
Batman,7.6,251188924,80,"If Batman did nothing else but restore pulp-art shadow to the icon sanitized in his pop-art TV reincarnation, it would be an achievement. Tim Burton's Batman, starring a subdued Michael Keaton as you-know-who and a supercharged Jack Nicholson as the Joker, handily accomplishes that mission."
Batman,7.6,251188924,80,Batman is largely content to skim the surface and bask in the light of its visual style.
Batman,7.6,251188924,75,"Despite its interesting, grim tone and undeniably striking visuals from director Burton and production designer Furst, the film fails to synthesize its strengths into a compelling whole."
Batman,7.6,251188924,75,"The main problem is that Burton operates best on a modest scale; saddled with a blockbuster, he doesn't know how to animate all the dead space."
Batman,7.6,251188924,75,"The movie's problem is that no one seemed to have any fun making it, and it's hard to have much fun watching it. It's a depressing experience."
Batman,7.6,251188924,70,"It's neither funny nor solemn. It has the personality not of a particular movie but of a product, of something arrived at by corporate decision."
Batman,7.6,251188924,70,"Nicholson's Joker will be the pivotal point for many. It's his energy, spurting like an artery, that keeps the picture alive; it's certainly not the special effects, the editing, which has no discernible rhythm, or the flaccid screenplay."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,"Raiders of the Lost Ark has it all—or, anyway, more than enough to transport moviegoers back to the dazzling, thrill-sated matinee idyls of old. It is surely the best two hours of pure entertainment anyone is going to find in the summer of '81."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,Plays like an anthology of the best parts from all the Saturday matinee serials ever made.
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,"One of the most deliriously funny, ingenious and stylish American adventure movies ever made."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,"Has all the right ingredients: a smart script, a likable hero, a dash of romance, more than a touch of comedy, and a lot of fast-paced action."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,Ford's performance is an underrated but remarkable achievement; he succeeds in fully embodying a comic-book style hero without ever descending into camp.
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,Spielberg has deftly veiled proceedings in a sense of mystical wonder that makes it all the more easy for viewers to suspend disbelief and settle back for the fun.
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is, in fact, about as entertaining as a commercial movie can be. What is it? An adventure film that plays like an old-time 12-part serial that you see all at once, instead of Saturday-to-Saturday. It's a modern ""Thief of Baghdad."" It's the kind of movie that first got you excited about movies when you were a kid."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,It's the thrills that keep it moving.
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,Finds the right balance between reverence and wit.
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,"The movie is so entertaining it hardly seems right to say it's susceptible to holes being picked in it, but it is."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,90,"Seeing “Raiders” is like being put through a Cuisinart—something has been done to us, but not to our benefit."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,90,"Travels fast and straight down a linear plot, and the ceaseless rush quickly becomes monotonous."
Twister,6.3,241721524,100,It's hard to dislike a picture with flying cows and oil trucks.
Twister,6.3,241721524,89,"It's a keeper, a tumultuous love story set against the backdrop of 24 hours of really, really inclement weather in the Oklahoma heartland."
Twister,6.3,241721524,88,"Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be paid to the rush of raw excitement ""Twister"" creates is that it makes it possible to ignore the painful awkwardness of the film's expository sequences and thudding dialogue of the ""OK, boss lady, hold your horses"" variety."
Twister,6.3,241721524,80,This film encompasses everything that is both grating and great about the blockbuster.  It gives scant regard to character depth or dialogue while still being a must-see hoopla of computer trickery that weakens the knees and raises the neck-hairs.
Twister,6.3,241721524,80,"Hurtling pace, by-the-numbers character development and exotic science. Tornado-chasing suddenly takes on a sex appeal not usually associated with horrendous storms."
Twister,6.3,241721524,80,"Doesn't have any pretensions. It is what it sets out to be: an effective piece of big money, early summer entertainment designed to blow viewers away."
Twister,6.3,241721524,80,"And for a movie that stars acts of God, this work of mortals provides surprisingly little liftoff. The stuff that whips through the angry skies in Twister is the most exciting part of the spectacle. Essentially, we're turned on by debris."
Twister,6.3,241721524,75,"Another theme park ride of a movie without an ounce of emotional credibility to it, Twister succeeds on its own terms by taking the audience somewhere it has never been before: into a tornado's funnel."
Twister,6.3,241721524,75,"The engineering of the special effects is fairly impressive, and the sight of so many objects and creatures being buffeted about carries a certain apocalyptic splendor."
Twister,6.3,241721524,70,"You want loud, dumb, skillful, escapist entertainment?  Twister works.  You want to think?  Think twice about seeing it."
Twister,6.3,241721524,70,"Extreme-weather buffs, thrill-ride junkies and anyone else in search of mindless entertainment need look no further."
Twister,6.3,241721524,63,"Audiences may howl at the hackneyed plot and dialogue, but you won't hear them over the Dolby sound effects assaulting your eardrums at a gazillion decibels."
Twister,6.3,241721524,60,The scenes of destruction-apart from being great to watch-provide much-needed relief from these people's unidimensional banalities.
Twister,6.3,241721524,50,"Twister not only blows, it sucks, too."
Twister,6.3,241721524,40,"Big swirls of computer-generated dirt, a bickering couple and the dead certainty that the fiancee will leave and the bickerers will get back together. An exciting night out, or what?"
Maleficent,7,241410378,83,"Yet nothing in their visually stimulating film registers as strongly as Jolie’s enigmatic, ever-changing face."
Maleficent,7,241410378,80,"Angelina Jolie is so wickedly enchanting in the magical, magnificent Maleficent, you may not notice how transporting this female-driven blockbuster really is."
Maleficent,7,241410378,80,"A few bumpy patches notwithstanding, the new feature is an exquisitely designed, emotionally absorbing work of dark enchantment."
Maleficent,7,241410378,75,"A moderately enchanting, sometimes thought-provoking corrective to the flaws in the story that inspired it."
Maleficent,7,241410378,75,Jolie's Maleficent is magnificent.
Maleficent,7,241410378,75,"In truth, you just can’t wait until the wicked Jolie returns to the screen. Whether a malevolent twinkle illuminates her beady eye or a heartbreaking tear rolls down her alabaster cheek, she is the film’s power."
Maleficent,7,241410378,75,"Calling Maleficent a ""modern-day classic,"" as some have asserted, is overreaching. The production is engaging and appealing but only the passage of time will determine whether it holds in the memory with the strength of its animated predecessor."
Maleficent,7,241410378,75,"The movie is a mess, but it's a rich mess. It has weight. It matters."
Maleficent,7,241410378,75,Maleficent imparts a feeling of enchantment. Here is a world that's strange and beautiful.
Maleficent,7,241410378,75,The result is a rare live-action Disney movie that merits comparison to its beloved feature-length cartoons.
Maleficent,7,241410378,70,"Whatever its flaws, Maleficent is a family-friendly Disney adventure that offers a relaunched and thoroughly delightful Angelina Jolie."
Maleficent,7,241410378,70,This is really a movie about the evil spell Jolie casts on us — it’s both a celebration and a demonstration of her formidable movie star might.
Maleficent,7,241410378,70,"Though it never plays like a polemic, the film has so much it wants to say the emotional power that might have made it a classic is undercut."
Maleficent,7,241410378,67,"Imaginatively, it places all the known elements of the story in different contexts, completely recasting this familiar fairy tale into a more poignant and resonant work."
Maleficent,7,241410378,67,"Maleficent feels spit-balled into more directions than barely 90 minutes of story time can adequately cover. It's once upon a time, happily ever after and a lot of undeveloped drama in between."
Maleficent,7,241410378,67,"The characters are boiled down to their essentials, the humor is timelessly broad, and Jolie's at her best when she's curling her claws and elongating her vowels like a black-sabbath Tallulah Bankhead."
Maleficent,7,241410378,63,"For all its limitations, Maleficent manages to be improbably entertaining to watch, due solely to its title character. As befits a star of her regal standing and superb self-awareness, Angelina Jolie has managed to bend even the Brothers Grimm to her indomitable will."
Maleficent,7,241410378,63,"While this is Jolie’s show, obviously — and she’s terrifically arch — the surprising dearth of other compelling characters doesn’t offer much distraction when things get off track."
Maleficent,7,241410378,63,"This is almost entirely Angelina Jolie's show...this is a performance that goes from point A to point B without seeming rote, or ho-hum."
Maleficent,7,241410378,60,"Enchanting enough to cast a spell over fans, of Jolie, of Disney, of ""Sleeping Beauty"" -- and of pure, cinematic escapism."
Maleficent,7,241410378,60,"Consciously or not, coherently or not, Maleficent tells a new kind of story about how we live now, not once upon another time. And it does so by suggesting, among other things, that budding girls and older women are not natural foes, even if that’s what fairy tales, Hollywood and the world like to tell us."
Maleficent,7,241410378,60,"If you go into Maleficent expecting Jolie to be the badass of Sleeping Beauty, you’re going to get burned."
Maleficent,7,241410378,60,"Despite its pitfalls, Maleficent entertains because of Jolie, who holds the wavering threads of Stromberg's spinning wheel together with aplomb."
Maleficent,7,241410378,60,"The aggressively unpleasant visuals certainly detract from the overall film, but Maleficent makes for a fascinating entry in an ongoing wave of projects that give “bad” women of literature a chance to present their side of the story."
Maleficent,7,241410378,60,"The action sequences are executed with rhythm and punch, and our heroine swoops and swirls around like Iron Man in a sheath dress. Maleficent may be short on true enchantment, but until we find a superhero who can pull off a black silk cocktail gown in battle, she’s very welcome."
Maleficent,7,241410378,58,It’s a dazzling showcase of fantasy-based filmmaking in the 21st century that also manages a feeble attempt at injecting feminist politics into an antiquated narrative. Yet its eventual climax strains from the obviousness of these efforts.
Maleficent,7,241410378,58,"Director Robert Stromberg, making his debut as a director after supervising the visual effects for movies like “Alice in Wonderland” and “Avatar,” lacks the transcendent touch."
Maleficent,7,241410378,58,"While I can see how there is a version of this film that might be able to successfully grapple with its central metaphor, I'm not sure Stromberg is the guy to make that movie."
Maleficent,7,241410378,58,More well-intentioned than accomplished.
Maleficent,7,241410378,50,Jolie’s commitment to the part is admirable: She gives this Maleficent a real emotional urgency. But the rest of the movie lets her down.
Maleficent,7,241410378,50,"It fails to live up to its early promise, mostly because of an uneven tone and murky character development"
Maleficent,7,241410378,50,Maleficent is out of balance in all sorts of ways. The effective silent sequences conflict with the frustratingly talky ones. The new material fits poorly with moments that directly quote the classic.
Maleficent,7,241410378,50,"Jolie's performance so overshadows the rest of the cast (and the rest of the movie) that you sometimes feel as if the other characters are, like us, just standing around watching her. This is not, however, the fault of the other actors. It's the fault of screenwriter Linda Woolverton, who doesn't give them much to do that's challenging or interesting."
Maleficent,7,241410378,50,Impressive. And violent. Just not a lot of fun.
Maleficent,7,241410378,50,"Why tell the Sleeping Beauty story anew? With this half-hearted film, Mr. Stromberg, the visual effects wizard behind such big-budget blockbusters as ""Oz the Great and Powerful,"" ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Avatar,"" can’t provide an answer."
Maleficent,7,241410378,50,"Uncertain of tone, and bearing visible scarring from what one imagines were multiple rewrites, the film fails to probe the psychology of its subject or set up a satisfying alternate history, but it sure is nice to look at for 97 minutes."
Maleficent,7,241410378,42,"Maleficent desperately tries to create a character whose motivation you will understand and empathize with. But the screenplay and direction are such a tangled, thorny patch of conflicting ideas that it's hard to tell what that motivation is supposed to be."
Maleficent,7,241410378,40,"If this tiresome yarn is the ‘true’ story of one of Disney’s most popular villains then, please, give us colourful lies and happy ignorance."
Maleficent,7,241410378,40,This icon of witchcraft can't save a production that's suffocatingly elaborate yet insufficiently bewitching.
Maleficent,7,241410378,40,"With more actual grrrl power, Maleficent would be a bold redo. Instead, it's a beautiful snooze, a story that hints at the darkness underneath our fairy tales and tarnishes the idea of true love without quite daring to say what's really on its mind: that even the best of us might not live happily ever after."
Maleficent,7,241410378,38,"Maleficent is an admittedly great-looking, sometimes creepy, often plodding and utterly unconvincing re-imagining of a famous romantic fairy tale as a female empowerment metaphor."
Maleficent,7,241410378,38,"Jolie comes to this party ready to bite, but the movie muzzles her. Even at 97 minutes, Maleficent is still one long, laborious slog."
Maleficent,7,241410378,38,"We may have all wanted to know the story behind those famed horns, but the mystery was far preferable to having Maleficent de-fanged and de-clawed in the process."
Maleficent,7,241410378,30,"Except for Angelina Jolie, exemplary as the fairy badmother who laid a narcotic curse on an infant princess, this pricey live-action drama is a dismaying botch."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,80,This is the perfect summer movie and perhaps the best Pirates of them all.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,75,Depp and Cruz only occasionally strike the sparks expected from two of the world's most beautiful people.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,75,On Stranger Tides feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first swashed his buckle.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,70,Marshall delivers old-fashioned swashbuckling action-movie thrills more than computer-engineered grotesquerie.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,70,"Captain Jack Sparrow is back in excellent form for his fourth adventure in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, which is more serious in the hands of a new director, Rob Marshall, and thanks to Penelope Cruz it's also a good deal sexier."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,70,"Serves as a welcome corrective, reviving the fun, feather-light frivolity that any film based on a Disneyland ride ought to exhibit."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,67,"It's a Herculean task to steal the thunder from a Johnny Depp performance, but Richard Griffiths (best known these days as Harry Potter's tubby Muggle uncle, Vernon Dursley) does exactly that."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,65,"The picture is cluttered and convoluted and big, and Marshall - taking over the reins from Gore Verbinski - doesn't seem to grasp how exhausting nonstop action can be."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,63,"Judi Dench is much more of a challenge. Drenched in powder and pomp, the grand old Dame pops up in a London carriage. She's there in a flash and then, as quickly, gone, and her fleeting presence is exactly like the fleeting merit of this fourth galleon in the portly franchise: It prompts stirrings, not quite all the way to feelings."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,63,"Best of all, here there be fun."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,63,"Frankly, the wow factor isn't that great."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,60,"Johnny Depp, back again as the swashbuckling miscreant who favors guy-liner and gold, somehow manages to keep this ship of fools afloat. But just barely."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,58,"Even the ""surprise"" appearance of Keith Richards, as the scurvy father of Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, has already been hyped to death in the advance press."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,"This installment, which is subtitled ""Give Us Your Money, Sheep,"" really isn't a Pirates of the Caribbean movie at all."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,I suppose you have to give credit to the movie for coming up with some badass killer mermaids.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,"Here's how it goes down: 4 is better than 3, about the same as 2 and worse than 1."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,"As a movie, On Stranger Tides would have to be considered a failure. The story does not engage, the characters are stick figures, the action sequences are perfunctory, and the whole enterprise reeks of being a money-grab."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,Surprisingly dull.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,"To press the point, there is absolutely no need for a fourth Pirates of the Caribbean."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,"Apart from Cruz, who throws herself lustily into her tough-seductress role, the actors give negligible performances, with McShane, Rush, and Keith Richards in a repeat cameo all playing nigh-identical smug glowerers."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,"Marshall deserves props for putting the ""show"" back into the Pirates business. But face it, he's polishing a giant turd."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,"This is eye-catching and forgettable in the patented Bruckheimer manner, which means you should be entertained if you're not expecting anything new."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,The movie is fun until they set sail.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,On Stranger Tides isn't nearly strange enough. Its one real act of piracy is stealing away your excitement.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,"Repetitious, tedious, and pretty much joyless."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,40,"Small kids won't really appreciate Johnny Depp, either, though frankly he's getting to be less fun as the series ages, possibly realizing that what's riskiest in Pirates 4 isn't walking the plank, but jumping the shark."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,40,"It is by far the least strange of all the ""Pirates"" episodes so far, with none of the cartoonish exuberance or creepy-crawly effects that made its predecessors intermittently delightful."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,40,"Despite Sparrow's ongoing flashes of charm, Depp himself seems to know he's coasting."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,40,"Depp's performance is still one of the few bright spots in the movie. Richards is back, too, in an all-too-brief appearance as Sparrow's father."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,40,"The new movie is simpler plotwise (a race to the Fountain of Youth), while at the same time being somehow more deadening."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,40,"As the seductive and conniving Angelica, Cruz is luminous, albeit not enough to compensate for Marshall shrouding virtually every major set piece in nighttime fogginess."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,40,"An overly complicated plot and poorly thought-out characters detract from the flashes of charm that Cap'n Jack still emits. Despite quality set-pieces and the best efforts of the cast, this is dull and crossbones."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,38,On Stranger Tides has the fishy smell of something washed ashore and sold as new. But this shipwreck isn't worth a wooden doubloon.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,38,The wastrel Sparrow ends up both overexploited and underpowered in this fourth outing.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,30,I've never seen a film in which what was actually onscreen seemed so irrelevant.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,30,"For a series so steeped in supernatural mumbo-jumbo, Pirates of the Caribbean displays remarkably little sense of wonder."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,30,"The IMAX print I saw was so murky as to make you give thanks for the few scenes shot in simple sunlight, the 3-D wasn't worth the bother, and never before have I wanted to chloroform an entire orchestra."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,25,This isn't absurdity. This is nonsense - and it's as boring as nonsense.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,25,Even the most forgiving moviegoer will recognize this movie as the blatant cash-grab that it is.
Ghost Busters,7.8,238632124,88,"Ghostbusters is one of those rare movies where the original, fragile comic vision has survived a multimillion-dollar production."
Ghost Busters,7.8,238632124,88,"Ghostbusters is a hoot. It's Murray's picture, and in a triumph of mind over matter, he blows away the film's boring special effects with his one-liners. Spotting a lusty, totally transformed, fire-breathing Slgourney Weaver, whose body has been overtaken by a spirit, Murray walks past her saying, ""That's a new look for you, isn't it?"" Thank you, Bill. And don't get outta here, you knucklehead. We like you in this kind of movie."
Ghost Busters,7.8,238632124,80,"Whoever thought of having evil's final manifestation take the form of a 100-ft. marshmallow deserves the rational mind's eternal gratitude. But praise is due to everyone connected with Ghostbusters for thinking on a grandly comic scale and delivering the goofy goods, neatly timed and perfectly packaged."
Ghost Busters,7.8,238632124,75,"With his deadpan delivery and snide quips, Murray more than holds his own amid the myriad state-of-the-art special effects."
Ghost Busters,7.8,238632124,70,"Although it reunites the comic talents of director Ivan Reitman, writer Harold Ramis and star Bill Murray, the team responsible for the Meatballs phenomenon, their style here is far more laid-back and relaxed. There are still plenty of laughs, but not of the frantic sledgehammer variety."
Ghost Busters,7.8,238632124,63,"Within the top-heavy cast, it’s Murray’s picture, as the popular comedian deadpans, ad libs and does an endearing array of physical schtick."
Ghost Busters,7.8,238632124,60,"However good an idea it may have been to unleash Mr. Murray in an ''Exorcist''-like setting, this film hasn't gotten very far past the idea stage. Its jokes, characters and story line are as wispy as the ghosts themselves, and a good deal less substantial."
Beverly Hills Cop,7.3,234760478,83,"Murphy exudes the kind of cheeky, cocky charm that has been missing from the screen since Cagney was a pup, snarling his way out of the ghetto. But as befits a manchild of the soft-spoken '80s, there is an insinuating sweetness about the heart that is always visible on the sleeve of Murphy's habitual sweatshirt."
Beverly Hills Cop,7.3,234760478,80,"Beverly Hills Cop finds Eddie Murphy doing what he does best: playing the shrewdest, hippest, fastest-talking underdog in a rich man's world."
Beverly Hills Cop,7.3,234760478,80,"Eddie Murphy looks like the latest victim of the Star Magic Syndrome, in which it is assumed that a movie will be a hit simply because it stars an enormously talented person. Thus it is not necessary to give much thought to what he does or says, or to the story he finds himself occupying."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,80,Ratner is unable to maintain the emotional intensity that has made this series so deeply epic. But he sure knows how to put on a show.
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,75,"Love it or hate it, X-III packs more action and razzle-dazzle visuals into its 104-minute running time than ""Mission: Impossible III,"" ""Poseidon"" and ""The Da Vinci Code"" combined."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,75,"The happiest news about the third (and final?) X-Men movie is actually quite sad: headstones. Yes, The Last Stand brings the lamentable deaths of several major characters."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,75,"I liked the action, I liked the absurdity, I liked the incongruous use and misuse of mutant powers, and I especially liked the way it introduces all of those political issues and lets them fight it out with the special effects."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,75,It delivers pretty much what's expected.
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,75,"Though the picture is not without its wow-inducing, SFX-driven moments, that potent X-factor is considerably diminished in Singer's absence."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,70,"It's a fast and enjoyable B-movie, though, and Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine brings some good stormy drama to the proceedings."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,70,"The result, though it delivers only in fits and starts, is still sharper and more inventive than most comicbook-adapted fare, and eventually gets the job done as far as action buffs are concerned."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,70,"If little else, the third and supposedly final entry in the  X-Men mega-franchise suggests that some movies -- or at any rate some formulas -- are not just critic-proof, they might even be director-proof."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,70,"If this really is the last stand, it's a stylish farewell indeed."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,70,"Ratner seems to have found a theme that he can relate to: A terrifying trio of angry, undomesticated women who all but run away with the movie."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,70,"Ratner's version is friskier, shallower-and more fun."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,70,"This is interesting stuff. So why does The Last Stand feel driven to dumb itself down, as if embarrassed by its own ideas?"
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,67,"I suppose it's asking too much of Ratner to impart some kind of visionary flourish to the proceedings. But without it, these comic-book movies all tend to look the same."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,67,"Whether the entry is good, great or (in this case) indifferent, it's always stimulating to return to the high-flying X-Men series."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,67,"Disappointingly, X-Men: The Last Stand slides back between the first two episodes. It's not stuporous, and it's not super."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,63,"Has a couple of emotionally resonant scenes that build on the first two story lines. But it lacks the intriguing moody quality of the previous films. The mutants are more pumped up and angry this time, rather than misunderstood and conflicted."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,63,"While I didn't love it, I enjoyed The Last Stand because it made me imagine the mutant powers I want to develop. I'm thinking along the lines of merging Rogue's suction abilities with Storm's controlled-rain skills."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,63,"But for all the sound, fury and spectacle, the film feels vaguely hollow and unsatisfying."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,63,Mostly about extending a Hollywood franchise with ever-diminishing returns.
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,63,"Director Brett Ratner can't make chicken a la king out of chicken droppings, and that's what writers Simon Kinberg (""XXX: State of the Union"") and Zak Penn (""Elektra"") supply."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,63,"With more superheroes, more action and more stuff blowing up than ever before, X-Men: The Last Stand has the climactic oomph that suggests a finale, though not the gravitas to suggest a resolution."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,63,"Comic-book enthusiasts can breathe a sigh of relief: Brett Ratner hasn't completely ruined the X-Men series a.k.a. ""The Franchise that Bryan Singer Built."""
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,63,"Singer's absence is felt but not fatal. By adding too much new blood Ratner loses some of the original DNA, but with its nifty set-pieces and a few nasty surprises, X3's still a worthy enough sequel to ensure it’s no Last Stand."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,60,"Only half a mess -- and even with all its flaws, it's an enjoyable diversion that shows both respect and affection for the formidable legacy of the ""X-Men"" comics."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,60,"Following two superior entries, Ratner's slick placeholder of a sequel lacks that crucial X-factor called inspiration."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,58,"Almost as mindless as ""Fantastic Four,"" but more annoying in that this one has philosophical pretensions."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,50,"Despite all the grand gestures of climax and resolution, there's a pronounced sense of autopilot; the only person who seems to be having a good time is Ian McKellen as the scheming Magneto."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,50,"There's much to enjoy here – Ratner's pacing is fluid and fast and the film rushes along its busy, cluttered way with something approaching melodramatic snarkiness – but it's also terribly busy and cluttered."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,50,"Mostly, as so often with these types of empty entertainments, you are left to wonder why companies that hire so many fine actors to run around under latex and foam and have the best technological wizardry money can buy seem to spend so little attention to the screenplay."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,50,"Last stand? My ass. Billed as the climax of a trilogy, the third and weakest chapter in the X-Men series is a blatant attempt to prove there is still life in the franchise."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,50,"It's a disappointing chapter in what until now has been a highly entertaining, even thought-provoking series."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,50,"Ratner makes a hash of the story and characters his predecessor brought to such complex, sympathetic life, delivering a pumped-up exercise in mayhem, carnage and blunt-force trauma."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,50,An uninspired hodgepodge.
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,50,"Long before the movie's climax, in which Magneto (Ian McKellen) turns smashed-up automobiles into fiery projectiles to be hurled at his enemies, those in the audience will know what it means to behold a flaming hunk of junk."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,40,"Has a few high points, but feels far too disjointed and slapdash to favorably compare to what came before."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,40,"What a comedown, after the weirdly beautiful things Singer and his technicians did in the first two movies."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,100,"Doctor Strange doesn’t always make sense — but so what? It’s a mind-blowing special-effects extravaganza, and the most exciting comic-book flick since “Deadpool.”"
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,88,"Doctor Strange doesn’t break formula, and no, they will never ever be able to surprise us with his origin story again. It’s still head, shoulders and cloak above so much of what’s being churned out the seemingly bottomless vaults of Marvel and DC Comics."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,88,"What Robert Downey, Jr. is to ""Iron Man"" and Ryan Reynolds is to ""Deadpool"" – that's what Benedict Cumberbatch is to Doctor Strange. By that I mean, he's everything."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,88,You know you’re in a top-drawer Marvel Comics adaptation when even the Stan Lee cameo is clever.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,88,"The action climaxes with a truly impressive finale, one that employs time going in multiple directions that’s like nothing I’ve ever seen in a movie before. The effects shots here aren’t just visually impressive; they actually let the narrative go to places it couldn’t without this level of, you’ll pardon the expression, wizardry."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,83,"For the first time, a Marvel movie draws that pencil line from dream to screen. Where the earlier films felt hard and shiny and steel-colored — the look of bashing action figures on a sidewalk — Strange is ink-smudged and obsessive. It's defiantly old-school — not the cozy, apple-scented nostalgia of the first Captain America film, but that cold, back-of-the-library whiff of eraser nubs and mold."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,83,A nice balance of solemn myth making and genre irreverence lifts Doctor Strange to Marvel's first tier of movie franchises.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,83,"Doctor Strange lacks the bloat that’s made other recent, blockbusting superhero films fall flat. It doesn’t lean too hard on the considerable talents of its stars, nor does it waste their talents. It keeps a brisk pace, but doesn’t rush. It gets weird, but not too weird. And if all else fails, it’ll make your jaw drop from time to time."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,83,Doctor Strange is thrilling in the way a lot of other Marvel movies are. But what makes it unique is that it’s also heady in a way most Marvel movies don’t dare to be. It’s eye candy and brain candy.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,This is a rare case in which Marvel has freed a director’s imagination instead of  straitjacketing it.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,One of the pleasures of Doctor Strange is the way it both wholly embraces and gently mocks the unapologetic geekiness of the enterprise.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"Ultimately, though, it’s Doctor Strange’s return to its protagonist’s long lost psychotherapeutic roots that works best."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"The space-and-time warping and mirrored realities in Doctor Strange are a blast. They’re inventive enough that they awaken wonder, provoking that delicious question: How did they do that?"
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"While it hardly pushes the envelope in terms of developing Marvel's homogenous narrative conveyor-belt, it does do so in other areas, suggesting that the MCU can see beyond the confines of its first two phases."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"A bizarre and beautiful detour on the Marvel journey, which culminates in a mind-bending, expectation-inverting final act. Not to be watched under the influence."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"Perhaps the strangest aspect of Doctor Strange, within the lockstep rubric of these things, is how non-Marvelly it manages to feel."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"Cumberbatch fits Doctor Strange like a pair of snap-tight surgical gloves, in yet another MCU triumph. Beautifully designed, brilliantly executed."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"It’s a tremendously engaging and likeable superhero ride, in which the classiest of casts show they know exactly where to take it seriously – and where to inject the fun."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"To his credit, director Scott Derrickson...navigates through the different zones with a fair degree of actual coherence, and delivers the entire package with evident ease and some flair."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"Yes, this new project shares the same look, feel, and fancy corporate sheen as the rest of Marvel’s rapidly expanding Avengers portfolio, but it also boasts an underlying originality and freshness missing from the increasingly cookie-cutter comic-book realm of late."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,78,"A tight, compact, and visually sumptuous origin story that revels in the surrealistic vision of Doctor Strange’s legendary creator and artist Steve Ditko."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,"Although the comic book tropes are all in place, the acting, tone, and visual effects keep them from becoming tedious. This is yet another solid building block in the foundation to Marvel’s ever-expanding superhero fortress."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,"Director/co-screenwriter Scott Derrickson generally keeps the massive enterprise moving smoothly along. The trip’s the trip here, and it’s well worth taking."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,"With a mischievous, metaphysical flourish, Doctor Strange administers some much-needed CPR to the flagging superhero genre. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel — a power-hungry villain (Mads Mikkelsen) tries to unleash hell on Earth, blah blah blah — but it’s a heck of a lot more fun than I’ve had at a Marvel movie lately."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,The upshot: The movie develops a distinctively trippy identity.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,"Cumberbatch fleshes out a portrait of uncompromised and resolute selfhood. In that way, he carries us and the movie over some long stretches of blue-screen emptiness."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,“Cool enough” doesn’t do justice to this blockbuster’s city - and reality-bending set pieces. “Awe-inspiring” is closer.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,"This latest in the ever-broadening Marvel movie landscape is fun. For an effects-laden franchise launch it's light on its feet, pretty stylish, worth seeing in Imax 3-D (for once, the up-charge is worth it) and full of tasty, classy performers enlivening the dull bits."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,Nothing that Marvel Studios has produced can compare to the visual splendor of Scott Derrickson's Doctor Strange.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,"Derrickson (Sinister) crafts a trippy phantasmagoria for Strange to fly screaming through as he begins his path to sorcerer supreme. The only thing missing is a Doors jam as the sequence unfolds a dizzying blend of psychedelia, geometric oddities and nightmarish dreamscapes."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,70,"Doctor Strange has one significant quality that most Marvel adaptations lack: A sense of humor about itself, which it wears as lightly as the most gossamer Cloak of Levitation."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,70,"Derrickson’s use of computer-generated action is a strength instead of a strain, and it’s not just showing off; in the context of the film, the bizarre images make sense."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,70,Doctor Strange is at its most entertaining when it’s unapologetically different from anything Marvel has done before.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,70,"It's not all that strange, but it's restlessly arresting and always technically impressive. Unlike most studio franchise fantasies, Doctor Strange rewards the eye rather than assaults it."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,70,"Entertaining in its grand flourishes but spottier when it comes to character work and thematic coherence, the film boasts a slightly darker and more mystical air than its peers, accentuated by some of the most arresting set pieces in the MCU canon."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,67,"Make no mistake; there is no disputing this is clearly one of Marvel’s better efforts. And, yes, attempting to break from the expected shackles of a lineage of other origin movies is difficult, but you still feel the formula straining at the core of Doctor Strange."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,67,"As with all of the best installments of the MCU, the film’s unique strengths have a perverse way of highlighting the franchise’s shared weaknesses. But Doctor Strange deserves credit for treating several of the ailments that have been infecting the series, and for diagnosing several more."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,63,"All in all, Doctor Strange is a fun and trippy excursion to a place where Marvel rarely seems to go: that is, to the retinal roots of the comics."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,63,The film is surprisingly engaging. It’s fun.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,63,"For all of its wondrous world-building and trippy effects, Doctor Strange isn’t the evolutionary step forward for Marvel that it needs to be storytelling-wise. Underneath all of its improvements, the core narrative is something we’ve seen countless times."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,60,"Doctor Strange is the psychedelic kung-fu spectacle that Marvel hoped director Scott Derrickson would deliver, but it’s got a strange problem – the doctor himself."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,60,"It's fun to have new version of an old Marvel favorite, and a storyline which adds some genuine mysticism to this ever-expanding franchise. But ""Strange"" is too often only odd when it needs to be truly magical, and Hollywood-safe when it needs to be brave."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,60,"There are sequences in Doctor Strange that could burn the top layer off your eyeballs, crammed as they are with some of the most unashamedly drug-inspired imagery since the ‘The Simpsons’ episode where Homer takes peyote. But problems arise when Doctor Strange tries to tackle the everyday stuff, like telling a half-decent story."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,60,"The bad news is the studio’s most innovative visuals are wedded to one of its most formulaic origin stories. In some scenes, Doctor Strange is Marvel’s most exciting movie yet. In others, it might be its most boring movie since Iron Man 2."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,58,"Allow me a quick lament: Do we really want to see a great actor like Cumberbatch, not to mention Chiwetel Ejiofor and Tilda Swinton, entombed in yet another superhero franchise?"
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,58,"This superhero adventure, like most of Marvel’s output, is well-paced enough with a few interesting ideas up its sleeve (including a refreshing climax featuring anti-destruction) that it should thus hold one’s attention. But for being devoid of a compelling story at its center, one walks away from Doctor Strange feeling as empty as the magic on display."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,50,"Little by little, though, unfunniness takes hold. Stephen’s training grows interminable. The mysticism turns deadly serious. The effects turn repetitious: Worst of all, the plot loses its way just as Stephen is coming into his own as a worthy antagonist of Kaecilius, a villain — or is he? — played with hollow-eyed intensity by Mads Mikkelsen."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,38,"If that wasn’t enough, there is something even more dispiriting about Doctor Strange beyond its halfhearted visual and narrative ambitions – an issue that made a brief blip on the cultural radar when the film was first announced but has distressingly gone unheard of since: This is a movie that revels in whitewashing."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,25,"People who ask nothing more for their money than a lot of nerve-scrambling computerized special effects might get through Doctor Strange, another in a long line of lengthy, stupid and unbearable Marvel Studios comic books on film, with minimal brain damage."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,80,"There was no way, no matter how much Spielberg flounce was imbued in this sprightly sequel, that it was going to be as good as the original. It isn't. By a long shot. But even two thirds of the way toward Jurassic Park is about a third better than your average buster of blocks."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,78,"The Lost World (unlike Spielberg's original film) leaps head first into the action, rushing, it seems, to get the film's real stars -- the dinosaurs -- to the screen as quickly as possible, and it does so with considerable verve."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,75,"Much of this movie seems like a retread of Jurassic Park (with a little King Kong thrown in at the end), not because director Steven Spielberg is intentionally copying himself, but because there's really not much more that he can do with the premise."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,70,"The story (adapted by Spielberg and David Koepp from Michael Chrichton's ""Lost World"") isn't much better than ""Jurassic Park."" And the predictability factor is high."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,70,"For the first half-hour, the movie is pretty crummy. Even Spielberg appears bored with the script's lame setup, its quick evocation of the first movie and its wan establishment of human villains and heroes. Like any 50-year-old adolescent, he can't wait for the dinosaurs. And when he gets to them, the movie ceases to bear any relationship to conceits of narrative and becomes a sheer adrenalin spike to the brain stem."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,70,It's not just that we've been there before but also that Steven Spielberg and his associates simply haven't been able to imagine as many flat-out scary moments this time around.
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,70,"The Lost World is a smoother, scarier ride than its predecessor, with twice as many dinosaurs twice as well designed eating twice as many people...But he's not particularly playful with his terrors here, and that's a disappointment coming from a filmmaker who can mix scares and laughs the way no one else ever has."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,60,"Where the original film was a cut-and-dried Pop-Art-flavored allegory pitting scientific hubris against the unpredictable, ungovernable forces of nature, the sequel is an all-stops-pulled, edge-of-your-seat adventure film whose messages are not so neatly packaged."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,60,"It would be imprecise to say that the thrill is gone, because The Lost World recovers from its turgid opening and comes to life, or does so in spasms."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,60,"Although the digital dinos look great, especially the clumsy stegosaurs, Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp have failed to absorb the single most important lesson from the movies they've looted: If your people aren't interesting, at least make your monsters memorable."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,60,"For all the enhanced ingenuity of the special effects in The Lost World, the element of surprise and originality (the idea of cloning dinosaurs from fossilized DNA) is no longer present. And screenwriter David Koepp (the movie is very loosely based on Michael Crichton's sequel to his novel ""Jurassic Park"") has come up with a pretty conventional story line."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,60,"David Koepp's script, from the Michael Crichton novel, is schematic and largely predictable. There's an obvious threat and not too many ways to quell it. Underneath the technical virtuosity is a standard chase film, and director Steven Spielberg does little to elevate it dramatically."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,60,"It's technologically more advanced, far more thrilling and there's infinitely more dinos per minute."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,50,"Steven Spielberg's blockbuster whips up superficial sorts of excitement, and unlike the original ""Jurassic Park,"" the picture looks tacky around the edges."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,50,"Steven Spielberg, a gifted filmmaker, should have reimagined the material, should have seen it through the eyes of someone looking at dinosaurs, rather than through the eyes of someone looking at a box-office sequel."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,50,"The biggest sequel of the summer has more dinosaurs, better special effects and more action than the original... But the inspiration is gone, and with it most of the fun."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,50,"The thrill is most certainly not in the script by David Koepp, written from Michael Crichton's novel....Most of the writing is the blandest sort of twaddle, jokes you can practically recite along with actors."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,40,Among the movie's many flaws are lackluster cinematography and leaden sound design. The Lost World also includes irritating little missteps in the plot.
Logan,8.1,226277068,100,"The R-rating does represent truth in advertising, and it has conferred a kind of liberation on what strikes me, a violence-averse moviegoer at heart, as the best superhero film to come out of the comic-book world, and I’m not forgetting Tim Burton’s “Batman” or Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight.”"
Logan,8.1,226277068,100,"Logan takes its indestructible metal claws to comic book movie norms and destroys them, and it’s a wonderful thing."
Logan,8.1,226277068,100,"This is a filmmaker’s film, a fully realized statement that oozes with the assurance and confidence of a hungry visionary who not only knows what he wants to do but how to do it."
Logan,8.1,226277068,91,Logan is the rare action flick in which the quiet moments are as compelling as any of the fights.
Logan,8.1,226277068,91,"What’s special about Logan is that it manages to deliver the visceral goods, all the hardcore Wolverine action its fans could desire, while still functioning as a surprisingly thoughtful, even poignant drama—a terrific movie, no “comic-book” qualifier required."
Logan,8.1,226277068,91,"James Mangold's Logan is an uncommonly mature comic book movie, practically from another universe unto itself. It's a movie demanding and deserving to be taken seriously, an elegy for a mutant."
Logan,8.1,226277068,90,It’s not just one of the best superhero movies ever – it’s a damn-fine cinematic representation of the human condition in all its agonizing forms.
Logan,8.1,226277068,88,"Logan isn’t the typical superhero flick. It’s more like a Western, with Jackman turning in a performance that’s reminiscent of Clint Eastwood in his Man With No Name days."
Logan,8.1,226277068,88,"More than any other comic book character outside of Nolan’s Batman, Wolverine has evolved. With his glimpse into what superhero movies can be, James Mangold has given us something sadly lacking in recent genre entries: hope."
Logan,8.1,226277068,88,"If Jackman and Stewart are serious about this being their mutual X-Men swan song, they could not have crafted a more heartfelt valedictory."
Logan,8.1,226277068,88,"For all its moodiness and melancholy, Logan is also a rip-roaring action film — and it’s wickedly funny at times as well."
Logan,8.1,226277068,88,It’s a captivating throwback that promises to lead the genre away from sci-fi flash and trickery. I’d rank it beside “X-Men: Days of Future Past” among the best X-Men entries.
Logan,8.1,226277068,88,Logan is the rare blockbuster that could be a game-changer. It will certainly change the way we look at other superhero movies and how history judges the entire MCU and DC Universe of films.
Logan,8.1,226277068,88,"Easily the best Wolverine outing, Logan is The Dark Knight of the mutant-filled X-franchise, a gripping film that transcends the comic-book genre by saying something important — and for Logan, that means coming to grips with needing loved ones in his life."
Logan,8.1,226277068,83,A rather brilliant mesh of dystopian and superhero tropes that proves to be as entertaining as it is timely.
Logan,8.1,226277068,81,"The weight of graphic, grotesque violence hangs over the entire movie. But the daring emotional violence lingers longer, well after the lights go down on the final shot."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"The film is stunningly bleak and staggeringly violent. Major characters go down in showers of blood and gore. I’ve seen worse and so, probably, have you, but never from such an essentially wholesome corporate enterprise with a target audience so young and hopeful."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"Logan is a strong argument for bringing the comic-book movie down to earth. It solidly hits its marks as it moves the franchise furniture around, and features striking special-effects scenes in which the world shudders to a near standstill."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"Logan is a serious take on the comic-book genre, the Marvel Cinematic Universe in particular, and it’s a good one. Not a great one, though, which it might've been if it hadn’t gotten in its own way, overdoing it with its R-rated freedoms."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"A stand-alone adventure, it’s also a salute to a series, a character and a quietly committed actor."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"It is not a superhero flick as we have come to know the genre but a road movie and a Western, one that plays with the myth of the aging cowboy."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"It's R-rated because it has grown-up things to say -- things about mortality, aging, guilt, regret, and about what happens when superheroes, tired of being superheroes, start thinking very dark, very human thoughts."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"In Logan, we have an example of a superhero story taken to new extremes and a franchise to a spare, sad, apocalyptic finish (or “finish”), with R-rated action scenes that are both rousing and unbearably violent."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"Amongst the swearing, past gripes and resentments exhibited by wearying central players there is humour, compassion and a great deal more heart and soul than we have come to expect from the rote, by-the-numbers dialogue of Marvels past."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"When it comes to playing a properly magnetic anti-hero with a gruff ’70s-cinema exterior and a dark reservoir of inner depth, Jackman really is the best at what he does."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"This is a fine, fitting finale for the movies’ greatest mutant."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"The heart of the movie is the unexpectedly poignant relationship between Xavier and Logan: I’d be tempted to call them the Steptoe and Son of the mutant world, although in fact Logan goes into Basil Fawlty mode at one stage with his own pickup truck, attempting to trash it – perhaps to teach it a lesson. Logan is a forthright, muscular movie which preserves the X-Men’s strange, exotic idealism."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"Overall, Logan is something rather special: a moving and mournful story of life at the end of the line, and the perfect blockbuster for these embittered times."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"Logan is a film for people, like me, who thought the only good bit of X-Men: Apocalypse was Michael Fassbender crying in the woods, and left the cinema wishing that had been the whole thing. It’s something no-one could have expected: a creatively risky superhero movie. And it deserves to pay off."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"Each time the violence explodes, it’s slashingly satisfying, because it’s earned, and also because Mangold knows just how to stage it."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"Seamlessly melding Marvel mythology with Western mythology, James Mangold has crafted an affectingly stripped-down stand-alone feature, one that draws its strength from Hugh Jackman’s nuanced turn as a reluctant, all but dissipated hero."
Logan,8.1,226277068,78,"As light on his feet as he is as a musical-comedy showman, Jackman is perversely even more pleasurable when he’s popping neck veins from the effort of heavy drama."
Logan,8.1,226277068,75,"Mangold mostly lets Logan stand as a showcase for Jackman, that rare performer who can take an already-iconic figure and own him completely, to the point where it’s hard to divorce the two."
Logan,8.1,226277068,75,"It has, simultaneously, the exhilarating feel of a departure and the finality of a full stop."
Logan,8.1,226277068,75,"Jackman and Stewart’s fond, easy dynamic helps to balance some very provocative brutality, as the movie pushes Wolverine’s berserk nature to graphic new extremes."
Logan,8.1,226277068,75,"Jackman and Stewart give perhaps the most heartfelt performances that they’re ever brought to an “X-Men” movie. Though the tone of the movie is pervasively downbeat, they’re both going out on a very high note."
Logan,8.1,226277068,75,"Logan is a bloody and noble finale to Jackman’s turn with the sideburns and metal claws. It broods and growls, lashes out and swears, and Jackman is magnificent at every one of those."
Logan,8.1,226277068,75,"A movie with the bleakest vision of Wolverine yet, but also hands down the best treatment the character has received on the big screen in the fifteen plus years Jackman has inhabited the role."
Logan,8.1,226277068,75,"Logan isn’t always a satisfying movie, but there’s a very satisfying answer to those questions waiting for viewers at the end of it. Satisfying not only because Mangold resolves things with some brilliantly expressive imagery, or because he endows this story with a no-shits-left-to-give honesty that defies its origins and justifies its spectacular violence and salty vocabulary, but because it proves how iconic Jackman has made this character over the last 17 years."
Logan,8.1,226277068,75,"In Logan, the clawed mutant Wolverine finally gets to slash through the constraints of a kid-friendly PG-13 rating, and the result is bloody, vicious fun. The squeamish will avert their eyes, and young children should not be allowed anywhere near this movie, no matter how many X-Men action figures they own."
Logan,8.1,226277068,70,"While this carnage is defensible in theory, and while the filmmakers have taken pains not to linger on the horrific brutality Logan and his terrible claws inflict, the gruesome situations presented, including more than one beheading, work at cross purposes with the film's more serious intent and reminds us that a scot-free escape from the strictures of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is not in the cards."
Logan,8.1,226277068,70,"It’s a mature consideration of the ideas underpinning its comic-book motifs. It’s also easily the best Wolverine movie of the three, and an impressive sendoff for Jackman’s version of the character."
Logan,8.1,226277068,70,Whether or not the “Wolverine” movies have a future — Jackman swears this is his last go-round — Logan is an exceedingly entertaining one.
Logan,8.1,226277068,67,"Set in 2029, Logan is the closest thing to a valedictory the Marvel universe has yet concocted. Depending on how sentimental you are about these things – me, not much – it’s a bittersweet event."
Logan,8.1,226277068,67,"The loner has to learn to put someone else first. It’s both as manipulative and hokey as that sounds, but occasionally it works well enough that you might find yourself getting choked up against your better judgment."
Logan,8.1,226277068,63,It recognizes that the thinly veiled secret of Wolverine’s loner act is that he’s always been a cog of some kind.
Logan,8.1,226277068,50,"Logan is deadly serious, and while its gamer-style killing sprees are meant to be excitingly brutal, I found them numbing and, in the climax, borderline offensive."
Logan,8.1,226277068,50,"When Logan and Laura unleash their furious scythes nothing feels settled or satisfied. The world grinds on, fruitlessly weary and wild."
Logan,8.1,226277068,50,"Boasting a few nifty action sequences and the always-compelling Jackman, Logan self-consciously aspires to retire this iteration of the steel-clawed hero with epic grandeur, and the results are often rousingly bleak. And yet, the risks taken...only make the formulaic redemption story and clichéd emotional underpinnings increasingly frustrating."
Logan,8.1,226277068,40,"The picture is mostly tedious and unpleasant, which is a shame for the sake of the performers. Jackman works hard here, and his performance does away with vanity altogether."
Logan,8.1,226277068,25,Logan is another heinous and sophomoric waste of Hugh Jackman ‘s time and considerable talent and another expensive throwaway aimed at milking money out of people who still read comic books. Color it stupid.
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,80,"Superior sequel, which is the very model of the limber, transnational Hollywood action comedy."
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,80,Winds up being faster and funnier than the first time. Chan's acrobatic high jinks play strikingly off of Tucker's wiseass humor.
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,80,"A winning combination. By some bizarre quirk of star chemistry, their persona complement each other, the action scenes have comic flair and the movie is mindless fun."
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,75,Action and comedy are more impressive here than in the first film.
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,75,"It hasn't got a brain in its body, but it's fun to watch."
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,75,"Coarser, more hectic, more cheaply written sequel."
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,67,"The co-stars genuinely like each other, and their pleasure is infectious."
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,63,"Except for its muddier than necessary photography, there aren't any surprises, which probably won't matter to the target audience."
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,63,"This sequel succeeds as a slightly convoluted, paint-by-the-numbers buddy/action comedy with fast, funny banter and well-choreographed fight scenes."
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,63,"Feels out of shape and self-satisfied, as if it knew it didn't have to try very hard."
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,60,Nothing more or less than a moneymaking encore. The story is functional. The performers assume their marks with almost flippant ease.
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,60,The action and humor are enough to make an hour and a half pass quickly and pleasantly.
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,60,This action comedy transforms LAPD detective Chris Tucker from an intolerably annoying egotist into a practically lovable intolerably annoying egotist.
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,50,Chan is still one of the most amazing -- and one of the most charming -- physical performers the movies have given us.
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,50,"If there's going to be a ""Rush Hour 3,"" the filmmakers need more of the Ziyi/Sanchez women warriors to punch up the sagging cross-cultural buddy humor of the Chan-Tucker partnership."
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,50,"Until a vigorous climax, the action scenes have little punch."
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,50,It's a fact that becomes riotously evident in the reel of outtakes that caps the picture and incites wonder about why no one thought to give us 90 minutes of those instead.
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,50,It's about half as much fun as the original.
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,50,Should please undiscriminating fans. But it in no way improves on the clichéd formula.
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,40,Looks as if it were thrown together as carelessly as slum housing.
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,40,"The contrast between Chan's charm and physical prowess and Tucker's lack of same is even more dramatic in this tiresome, leaden sequel."
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,38,Tucker's scenes finally wear us down. How can a movie allow him to be so obnoxious and make no acknowledgment that his behavior is aberrant?
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,38,"It's as light on its feet as a dead elephant. It's never clever or smart, nor is it terribly thrilling or engaging during its numerous fight sequences."
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,38,"Summertime popcorn pictures don't get much goofier than this silly sequel, which is everything you'd expect and nothing you wouldn't."
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,30,This movie doesn't just kill time but tortures it.
Rush Hour 2,6.6,226164286,30,"The best parts of the movie occur during the outtakes, which are genuinely funny. The movie proper is insufferable."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,88,"I lost count but the word “family” is mentioned upwards of 50 times, many more times than it is in, say, Lilo & Stitch. Yes, it is way too much, like everything else in this aggressively over-the-top film, but at the same time, it just feels nice to be part of the group."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,88,"Diesel and Johnson are at their testosterone-charged best. Theron, who seems to be auditioning to become the next Bond villain, is ruthlessness personified."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,83,"The Fate of the Furious doesn't merely suspend disbelief, it expels it like a delinquent student told to never come back."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,83,"The Fate of the Furious is almost impossible not to like. It achieves exactly what it sets out to do, successfully lighting up the brain’s pleasure centers at each opportunity with a variety of tools in its arsenal."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,80,"The biggest show is, naturally, saved for last.... Nothing in all of the Fast & Furious movies has ever felt bigger or more ridiculous — two things F8 rightfully thrives on. It’s exhilarating. Now how will they top this one?"
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,80,"The Fate of the Furious is nothing more than pulp done smart, but scene for scene it’s elegant rather than bombastic, and it packs a heady escapist wallop."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,78,"What sets apart this eighth outing is its giggling bouts of male henpecking, all puffed feathers and nyah-nyah taunts."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"If the fate of the Furious series is to grow somehow both wearier and dumber with age, then the eighth film is proof of a mission firmly accomplished. And there’s no shame, Vin, in hanging it all up after a job well done."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"Polar chaos notwithstanding, “Fate” delivers action with more consistent visual precision than in the last couple of films, as newly enlisted director F. Gary Gray accesses the flair he brought to 2003’s “The Italian Job.”"
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"The movie zips along quickly, full of popcorn-worthy moments."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"The action is not just big — big is easy. It’s creative. It’s choreographed. It’s unexpected and delightful. It’s lots of fun and a stark contrast to the previous film, “Furious 7,” which was huge but flat, just commotion without inspiration."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"Your mileage may vary when it comes to the over-the-top carnage and in-your-face machismo, but it’s impressive just how bonkers Fate is, like a litter of kittens hopped up on grade-A catnip."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"The Fate of the Furious doesn't have a thought in its head to match the best of Bond and Bourne. What it is, in every sense of the term, is insanely entertaining."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"The movie Tokyo-drifts into tedium in its more chaotic, casually gruesome chase scenes, and the “serious” dialogue is so consistently clunky it feels like it’s been carved from woodblocks with a dull butterknife. Thankfully, it’s frequently also much funnier and lighter on its feet than previous outings, and a lot of that credit goes to Statham and Johnson."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,70,The spectacle gives you enough action from enough famous names to sustain the momentum of its legacy.
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,65,"Gray’s prosaic style robs Fate of the Furious of any real sense of self-awareness or humor, which could never be said about Lin or Wan’s installments."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,63,"“Dumbing down” was coined for productions like this: big, splashy, testosterone-fueled monstrosities whose sole purpose is to give a studio box office bragging rights for a few weeks."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,63,"“Fate” gives fans of the franchise exactly what they want, provided they can ditch logic as easily as the movie does."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,63,The Fate of the Furious distinctly drops the level of quality in this series for the first time this decade.
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"Zoom, crash, repeat with squealing, burning and flaming tires — it’s all predictably absurd and self-mocking, and often a giggle when not a total yawn."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"It’s an odd sensation to watch a Fast & Furious film and find yourself wishing the special effects lived up to the writing, but – well, here we are."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"A very big, exceedingly dumb thrill ride."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"This is a big dumb action movie in its purest, most honourable sense: fast, furious and frequently fun."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"Fast 8 is more of the same, more or less, with the emphasis heavily on more."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"Overall, there’s a sense that ‘Fast and Furious 8’ knows exactly where it wants to go and won’t bust a gasket getting there: you might ask for a little more character work here, a few more plot surprises there, but on the whole this rattles along just fine."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"Fate delivers exactly what fans have come to expect, for better and for worse."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,58,"While The Fate of the Furious is an unquestionably enjoyable outing, it’s beginning to feel a lot like fatigue on a long-enduring franchise."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,58,"More so than in any of the other movies, Dom’s wrecking crew of car nuts comes across like survival-of-the-speediest tacho-fascists, high-fiving their way through a path of destruction and to a collateral death toll that one presumes now numbers in the hundreds."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"There are disposable characters, and not just the villain’s minions. But one of the dumber elements of these movies is how so few of the actual leads, friend or foe, from previous pictures seem to stay dead."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"With The Fate of the Furious, it feels like the movies have gotten as big as they can get, and the gleeful absurdity that drove them is losing ground to the specter of obligation."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"In my favorite scene, Hobbs leads his tween daughter’s soccer team in a haka (Maori war dance) to intimidate their rivals. Can’t wait for “Fast and Furious 11: No Boys Allowed.”"
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"There’s certainly a lot to enjoy in The Fate of the Furious, but even the strongest moments are less spectacular this time around."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"The problem this time around is the plot is particularly idiotic, the supposedly snappy quips are lame and come at some weirdly inappropriate moments — and it’s all delivered in an extremely bloated package."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"This is just the sweeps-week Fast And Furious that jumps the shark, ready to right itself come next season – and it better. Dominic Toretto’s team deserves to go out in a blaze of glory, not a slippery skid that can’t be controlled."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"Really, the movie is the third cheeseburger, the fourth beer, the fifth ice-cream sandwich. It’s gluttony, which is kind of enjoyable when you’re in the middle of committing it but leaves you feeling sluggish and remorseful later when you’ve had time to think about it."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"Even as Fate has its fun and chases its highs (a few of which are pretty satisfying), it’s hard to shake the growing sensation that the bloom might be coming off the rose."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"The action has become incoherent, largely past the point of enjoyability."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"It's ridiculous but fun, as it careens from Havana to Berlin and icy, terrorist-ridden Russia played by Iceland, and a spit-ton of medium-grade digital effects. But the second hour gets to be a real drag, and not the racing kind."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,42,"F8 is the worst of these films since “2 Fast 2 Furious,” and it may be even worse than that. It’s the “Die Another Day” of its franchise — an empty, generic shell of its former self that disrespects its own proud heritage at every turn."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,40,"The series seems to have at last entered its frustrating, decadent, spinning-its-wheels phase."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,40,There is only one inventive action sequence here.
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,38,"The film finally tips the franchise over from modestly thoughtful stupidity into tedious, loud inanity."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,20,"Is it so much to ask for dialogue that doesn’t make you roll your eyes throughout “F8”? Or, you know, a story that adds up?"
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,20,"""Fast and Furious"" movies are supposed to be unchallenging, but Fate of the Furious is full-on brain-dead."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,0,"Who am I to call it soulless, graceless, witless, incoherent — even for the franchise — and, not incidentally, brain-numbingly long at 136 minutes?"
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,90,"Take my word for it, or better yet go find out for yourself: Big Hero 6 is a treat."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,90,"East meets West to immensely satisfying effect in the vibrant mash-up of an animated romp, Big Hero 6."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,89,"Sweet and sharp and exciting and hilarious, Big Hero 6 comes to the rescue of what's become a dreaded movie trope — the origin story — and launches the superhero tale to pleasurable new heights."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,88,It’s a movie that’s as fun to watch as it is funny. But the real appeal of Big Hero 6 isn’t its action. It’s the central character’s heart.
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,88,"With a film this funny, exciting and visually stimulating, who cares if you know exactly what's going to happen next, and when."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,88,"The storytelling is solid, propelled by characters that you come to care about."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,83,"At times, Big Hero 6 gets a little too noisy for its own good, but that never manages to drown out its many quieter charms."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,83,"Whatever flaws it has are ones of over-enthusiasm and over-ambition and are therefore easy to forgive, especially because when it works, it really works."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,80,"After ""Frozen,"" Disney delivers a heart-melter. The sweet, witty main pairing focuses a potentially busy, derivative super-group tale. Stay for the sting: Big Hero 7 is practically a given."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,80,"The Scooby-Doo-ish central plot is forgivable in a movie with so much visual verve, energetic action and a character so wondrously designed as Baymax."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,80,"Amid all the nerd-inspired firepower that gives the movie much of its flash, the big boy's droning tone proves to be the film's stealth weapon, perfect for pulling off highly targeted comic strikes."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,80,Big Hero 6 is good enough to transcend its blah ending and to make the case that every superhero story should be entirely animated.
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,80,"It ultimately amounts to a feature-length origin story, but with characters this unknown and execution this fun, that’s an asset, not a liability."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,80,"Big Hero 6 was executive produced by Pixar guru John Lasseter. You can see the influence in the high quality, from the appealing 3D animation to the unusually sharp story and script (a cooperative effort credited to seven people)."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,80,"A melding of old and new modes of animation, in which the attentive artistry of the past coexists with the hyper-detailed, computer-generated present."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,78,"Another friggin’ superhero story that acknowledges comic-book tropes while rarely subverting them, Big Hero 6 is powered nonetheless by its witty charms, lively animation, and swift pace."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,"This one's a winner. And Baymax, baby, call your agent. You're about to be a household name."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,"Although competently made and consistently engaging, there's nothing special about this animated superhero origin story."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,"An action adventure that puts brain ahead of brawn as a valued commodity is always reason to celebrate. Add in the considerable heart that Baymax contributes (with elements borrowed from both “WALL-E” and “Up”), and you have a winner."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,The most endearing character in Disney's animated superhero animated movie is a one-man Affordable Care Act. (Make that a one-robot ACA.)
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,A rousing movie that’s satisfyingly infused with traditional Disney sentiment.
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,"Big Hero 6 is second-tier Disney/Marvel entertainment, fine for a day out with the children yet doesn't seem enough, after the creative advances of Wreck-It Ralph and the emotional heft of Frozen."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,The visuals are splendid. Even close-ups of face and hair are something to marvel at.
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,"Without making a big deal out of it, Big Hero 6 features a shrewdly balanced and engaging group of male and female characters of various ethnic backgrounds. It'd be nice to live in a world where this wasn't worth a mention, but it is. And yet the movie belongs to the big guy."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,"It’s manipulative and overlong, too loud and “Incredibles” action-packed for the very young. But the manipulation errs on the side of mercy, compassion, sacrifice and humanity."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,"As much as the action stuff works and would indicate that any other property Marvel entrusts to the animation side of things is in good hands, Big Hero 6 gets by more on the charms of its comedy."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,70,"Therein lies part of the dissonance with this often-wonderful, deceptively strange movie. You could get emotional whiplash watching it."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,70,Big Hero 6 is easier to admire than to love. It veers from chipper to noisy to dark stretches where it grapples with adult-sized grief.
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,70,"After establishing its fresh and relatable origin story, the movie gets bogged down with a relatively generic villain’s power-hungry schemes. Still, there’s enough that’s new and different about Big Hero 6 to get excited about, especially for those still too young for Marvel’s more intense live-action fare."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,67,Big Hero 6’s considerable graces as an animated film — its fantastical layouts and bouncy sense of figure and motion — are offset by its deficiencies as a second-rate superhero flick.
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,63,"Gorgeous and disturbing, Big Hero 6 is a departure for Disney: a film targeted at older kids, and the studio's first venture into straight-up comic book culture. Walt would flip in his cryogenic chamber if he saw this anime-style production."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,63,"Consider it a more family-friendly ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" with the added kiddie appeal of a big, inflatable windbag to laugh at and love."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,63,"The film quickly becomes a study of grief and retribution, and the question of how exactly technology can and should be utilized in the treatment of these emotions."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,60,"It is, after all, the Baymax show - and he is cute, cuddly, comedy gold. Fortunately, although Big Hero 6 has various flaws, he's generally on hand to patch them."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,60,"Especially when Baymax is onscreen doing his adorable-puffy-robot thing, Big Hero 6 qualifies as a better-than-average kids’ movie with enough cross-generational appeal to make it a fine choice for a family weekend matinee. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that this film was designed to function as a starter kit for future Marvel aficionados."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,60,"As far as 'toons go, it's probably most reminiscent of Pixar's ""The Incredibles,"" given that both are stories about superhero teams. There are also echoes of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" in the flying scenes, featuring little Hiro perched atop Baymax's back. But even then, Big Hero 6 still feels like its own, distinct creature."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,60,"The animation is fluid and inventive, balancing action and slapstick with aplomb."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,50,"Big Hero 6 even has a title that sounds like a product ordered off the takeout menu of the type of restaurant that recombines a few elements in many ways. That could work fine, if any of the ingredients were particularly flavorful."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"Not only is Fallout the best Mission: Impossible film by a considerable margin, it is also undoubtedly the best action film of the year."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,Cruise and McQuarrie have made the best film in the franchise’s history and the most enjoyable and exciting action movie in several years.
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"It’s got that finely-tuned, perfect blend of every technical element that it takes to make a great action film, all in service of a fantastic script and anchored by great action performances to not just work within the genre but to transcend it. This is one of the best movies of the year."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"Unlike many of his action-cinema contemporaries, McQuarrie excels at creating clear lines of sight for his set pieces, and cutting them together to ensure maximum tension."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"Writer and director Christopher McQuarrie borrows just the right amount of familiar spy tropes in his second “M:I” outing, and his film, while intelligent and witty, never becomes too self-serious or chatty. It’s the best night out at the movies so far this summer."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"McQuarrie also builds on the last film’s self-aware level of wit and, most importantly, its set-piece-crafting sophistication. No action sequence is allowed to peter out, or be chopped to ribbons in the edit, or lean on the crutch of CG augmentation."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"A combination of thrilling stunts, insane daring and clever writing make this a stunning piece of action cinema. Just be sure to take your heart meds first, and hold on tight."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"McQuarrie brings grace and grit, and Cruise brings it, period. This quick-witted, fleet-footed franchise shows no sign of flagging."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"He’s only Tom Cruise because nobody else is willing to be — or maybe he’s only Tom Cruise so that nobody else has to be. Either way, Fallout is the film he’s always promised us, and it was totally worth the wait."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"OK, McQuarrie may not have De Palma’s sweat-drop precision, John Woo’s craziness or the impish wit of Brad Bird, but his mastery of logistics here is easily sufficient to make it the blockbuster of the summer."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"Simply put, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is the best action movie you will see this year. You’ll probably leave the theater overcome with an urge to go jumping from building to building."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"It’s the kind of pure, straight-no-chaser pop fun that not only keeps taking your breath away over and over again, it restores your occasionally shaky faith in summer blockbusters."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,91,"Mission Impossible: Fallout is not a triumph of literal realism, orderly plotting, or restraint, but it’s proof that thoughtful execution, comedic timing, and a true moral center count for much more."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,91,"Moving like the lit fuse that blazes brilliantly across the opening credits of both the original Mission: Impossible television series and its first big-screen adaptation, Fallout turns out to be a breathlessly exciting action spectacular: the blockbuster spy thriller as sustained endorphin rush."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,91,Mission: Impossible - Fallout merges the franchise’s big-budget spectacle with an utterly ferocious style of action filmmaking that far surpasses what McQuarrie executed in either Rogue Nation or Jack Reacher.
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,91,"McQuarrie has proven himself such a keen purveyor of large-scale cinema that not only solidifies Fallout as a benchmark for the franchise, but a bona fide manifesto for breathtaking, high-stakes action–a mission that the genre as a whole would do well to accept."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"To be fair, you can scoff at the antics and still be swept away. The final quarter of Mission: Impossible—Fallout takes place in Kashmir, with a helicopter chase through deep gullies and past snowy peaks. McQuarrie keeps the action crisp and clear, to match the icy air."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"This episode is something special, because the dance is so smashingly gorgeous."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"There’s a whole lot of everything in the Mission: Impossible — Fallout, an entertainment machine par excellence that skitters around the world and has something to do with nuclear bombs, mysterious threats and dangerous beauties. Mostly, it has to do with that hyper-human Tom Cruise, who runs, drives, dives, shoots, flies, falls and repeatedly teeters on the edge of disaster, clinging to one after another cliffhanger."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"As these films have gone on, they’ve become more and more fascinated with Hunt’s essential ludicrousness. Mission: Impossible – Fallout decrees him elemental—a crucial, indefinable component keeping the very fabric of humanity knitted together. The film is so dizzyingly fun that, at least while you’re watching, it seems like a sound conclusion."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"It’s not just “Impossible,” it’s irresistible."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"A cinematic centrifuge of acrobatic stunt work, breakneck chases and immersive action, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is a perfectly calibrated piece of filmmaking that plays the viewer like a drum right from the start."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"McQuarrie clearly believes in creating coherent set pieces: His combat scenes are tense, muscular, and clean, shot and edited in such a way that the spatial geography makes sense. He places audiences just over Cruise’s shoulder, or staring into the actor’s face as he grimaces with exertion."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"The sixth film in the series is among the most outstanding, delivering a near-exhausting amount of stupendous action sequences paired with deft character drama and the requisite life-or-death stakes. Fallout is a testament to writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, who gives the proceedings a witty, sophisticated grandeur, and yet the film belongs to Cruise and his seemingly limitless passion for putting himself and his audience through the wringer."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"In ragged times, the sophisticated derring-do of Fallout is a welcome gift, a slick and studio-polished adventure that nonetheless has the undermining wink of transgression. The movie’s nerve and moxie successfully make us forget its corporate overlords, and all those other oligarchs grinding millions of American lives into nothing."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"Even as the narrative becomes more perplexing — as before, realistic masks conceal true identities, characters' actual agendas remain hidden — the fast-moving spectacle unfolds in extraordinary fashion."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"After two decades, Fallout might be the finest film in the series. (To me, it’s a toss-up between this and Ghost Protocol.) Either way, Mission: Impossible is clearly the best ongoing action franchise in the world. And nothing else even comes close."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,88,"“Fallout” just might be the best of the franchise, and what a rare thing that is for a long-running series."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,88,"Mission: Impossible — Fallout is definitely everything we expected, and more. You might need to go lie down afterward, in a good way."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,88,"Mission: Impossible — Fallout, is everything a summer action pic should be — a delirious procession of stunning stunts, epic brawls, state-of-the-art car chases and ticking clock countdowns."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,88,"Some of it’s pleasingly old school in its reliance on formidable stunt work. Enough of it, though, gets a digital effects assist for the amazements to scale the heights of plausibility and then leap, like a gazelle, to the adjacent mountain of sublime ridiculousness."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,85,"McQuarrie’s sense of building a scene on the barest of elements, communicating the most empirical of information, is so breathlessly impeccable, the plot barely seems to matter aside from creating easily understood stakes and giving Ethan Hunt a reason to keep, in the parlance of the film, figuring it out."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,85,"Fallout is the boldest of a series that has set a very high (sometimes literally so) standard for breathtaking set-pieces. By my count, the new film has at least seven of them—a generous gift to summer audiences from daredevil star Cruise, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,83,"Mission: Impossible knows exactly what it needs to be: a fun and chummy thrill ride that’s always self-aware. Fallout follows that agenda, while also revisiting its more severe roots. It’s a sequel in every sense of the word, reintroducing not only familiar faces, but styles, themes, and motifs of past films."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"Genre convention means it’s a foregone conclusion that this mission is not, in fact, “impossible”, but director Christopher McQuarrie cleverly controls the ticking clock quality that makes these films so much fun."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"Mission: Impossible—Fallout may be the best Mission: Impossible movie since the first, made in the dawn of the cat-Internet age, 1996, by Brian De Palma. Or perhaps it’s just the one with the mostest: even by the franchise’s extravagant standards, Fallout throws off Hope-diamond levels of grandeur."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"Whether it’s the next in a long line or a summation of a fun series, Mission: Impossible — Fallout is a movie that all but defines escapism at its finest."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"His sixth Mission: Impossible movie, Mission: Impossible — Fallout, isn’t the best of the bunch (that would be number four, Brad Bird’s Ghost Protocol), but it’s easily the second-best and certainly the Cruise-iest, meaning it’s nearly as entertaining as it is strenuous. Which is a mighty high bar!"
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"In addition to the absurd stunts and convoluted plot machinations, what makes the Mission: Impossible movies work in general, and Fallout in particular, is that they let their characters be characters, driven by a number of complex factors, even when they’re chasing an enemy or trying to get out of a scrape."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"The practical effects, meaning the real stuff the computer never touched, make all the difference when you’re asking audiences to see the characters as human instead pawns in a digital game."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"This is a film that wants you to live in the moment, to enjoy what is on screen when it is there in front of you and not worry how it fits into a plot that can be confusing but clears up in time for the inevitably rousing conclusion."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"Mission Impossible: Fallout is a worthy addition to the franchise and a fast pace thrill-ride.  McQuarrie manages to keep the story, stunts, and structure fresh."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"At nearly two and a half hours, it’s designed to test your patience for the things that matter in these movies — violent confrontation, deception, jokey camaraderie, and over-the-top action — but it does so with a remarkably re-engaged fluidity of purpose."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,78,"A relentlessly entertaining exercise in putting Cruise’s Ethan Hunt through his paces again. And again. And again. But hey, there’s much pleasure in watching him continually fall off things."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,77,Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a fun but very familiar entry in the long-running franchise.
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"As summer franchise movies go, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is near the top of the heap."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"Given all the on-screen risk-taking, Mission: Impossible - Fallout plays it pretty safe. What you get is essentially an action movies greatest hits package."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"The result is a film that won’t make a dent in cinema history but, with an ebullient gusto, it is impossible to resist."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"Although perhaps a little too long and not as tightly plotted as Rogue Nation, Fallout offers everything a viewer could reasonably expect from a Mission: Impossible production. It’s reliable."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"Not just one of the best but, at its best, an exercise in pure action-movie propulsion and an essay in how to get from Point A to Point B in the most ingenious and exhausting way imaginable."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"Much ink has been spent analyzing this enduring phenomenon called Tom Cruise, and what motivates him, onscreen and off. “I just want to entertain people,” he said recently. That’s one mission he can still nail."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"[Cruise] makes the movie fun to watch with his age-defying eagerness and death-defying stunts that bring a reasonably human scale back to blockbuster action, benumbed of late by the low-stakes digital fakery of special-effects movies."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"While the movie on the whole isn’t quite the caliber of the last two missions (“Ghost Protocol” and “Rogue Nation”), director Christopher McQuarrie’s action-packed “Fallout” set pieces are outstanding, finding great character moments in the middle of the explosiveness"
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"While some are hailing Mission: Impossible — Fallout as something truly special, I wouldn’t go quite that far. It does, however, offer as many thrilling dance numbers—I mean, action sequences—as any of the other installments."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"Even its most irritating parts don’t fatally damage a whole that works amazingly well, despite its own excesses."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"There’s a delirious joy in watching this much action, this well executed at every level."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,70,"For a massive summer tentpole, Fallout’s pleasures are gratifyingly straightforward, direct without being dumbed-down. It’s a meat-and-potatoes banquet, one that doesn’t need to be interesting to be satisfying."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,70,"Mission: Impossible - Fallout is cocked, locked and ready to blow you away with more than just Henry Cavill's forearms."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,60,"Over two-and-a-half hours, you get a lot of deafening bangs for your buck, and the tourist location stunts are impressive - but there isn’t as much humour in the dialogue as before."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,50,"As in Rogue Nation, Fallout‘s action scenes are cleanly composed and easy to follow, and so abundant as to become monotonous."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,75,A welcome throwback to family-friendly PG moviemaking.
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,70,"This ain’t ""The Da Vinci Code,"" folks, and the reason you can tell is that it’s actually quite entertaining."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,70,Cage is back in crackling good form in National Treasure: Book of Secrets.
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,67,It's a measure of the film's infectious goofiness that Cage seems altogether more interested in clearing the name of a long-dead ancestor than in finding a city of gold.
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,67,"Director Jon Turteltaub has fun with Indian glyphs, giant stone pulleys, and an Indy Jones-worthy City of Gold located beneath the rocky shoals of Mount Rushmore."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,60,"It contains all the elements from the original film...But that's the problem: It's virtually the same movie with new locations. Oh, plus Helen Mirren. Not a bad addition, but the popcorn fun is gone."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,60,"Graced with some extra star wattage courtesy of Helen Mirren and Ed Harris, this diminishing-returns sequel sends Nicolas Cage on another quest to strike it rich, get young auds excited about history and solve puzzles that are generally less stimulating than yesterday's Sudoku."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,60,"Like its predecessor, “National Treasure,” this sequel amounts to a bunch of crossword puzzle answers stitched together with explosions, chases and displays of intuitive reasoning that the “Twin Peaks” F.B.I. agent Dale Cooper would reject as too right-brained."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,58,"A strictly by-the-book sequel: It doesn't cheat series fans but it doesn't offer many thrills or surprises or lingering puzzles, either."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,50,"No better than the first – which means it will probably be creamed by critics and make a jillion dollars. But really, standards are standards."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,50,"The movie has terrific if completely unbelievable special effects. The actors had fun, I guess. You might, too, if you like goofiness like this."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,50,"This sequel is what you would expect: If you liked the original, you'll probably enjoy this retread. But be warned: It bogs down in a drawn-out scene near the end. There's certainly nothing to treasure about this movie, but if a popcorn movie with moderate intrigue and occasional humor is what you're after, this is just the ticket."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,50,"Everything has been significantly amped up -- bigger, louder, further removed from reality -- but it also feels that much more forced. Cage and Kruger seem like they're not having much fun this time around, and Bartha still gets the best throwaway lines."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,50,"If there was an iota of plausibility to any of this, we could forgive the film's greater leaps of imagination - all those break-ins of absurdly unprotected bastions of Western civilization. But this is not audience-participation suspense. All you can do is sit and watch, and wish there was more wonder."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,50,"Often as noisy, dippy, and enjoyable as 2004's ""National Treasure,"" and when it's not, it's just another sequel, more absurd than most."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,50,"It shares all the original's shortcomings —--it’s too long and too loud and filled with historical disinformation -- but none of the snap that made ""National Treasure"" fun for kids and a guilty pleasure for some adults."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,50,"Leave it to coproducer Jerry Bruckheimer to revive the Indiana Jones cycle without the period setting, the camp elements, or Spielberg's efficiency; director Jon Turteltaub just plods along, and the script by Marianne and Cormac Wibberley is equally poker-faced."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,40,"Is the film fun? Yeah, in that campy kind of ""The Mummy"" way, but it is also weak as a sequel in that very campy ""The Mummy Returns"" type of way."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,40,"Book of Secrets isn’t so much a romp as a long trudge through American history factoids and conspiracy-theory gobbledygook. Cool car chase, though."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,40,A turgid action sequel that loses sight of plot and characters in its humourless efforts to impress.
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,38,"All you want from a movie like this, really, is a little brainless fun, and it keeps holding out on you. Everyone looks fatigued. Even Cage’s toupee seems ambivalent about having signed on for a sequel."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,38,"The movie does feature a nice, teasing chemistry between veteran actors Voight and Mirren (who clearly relishes the chance to break out of stuffy melodrama), but this shallow, empty puzzle requires more than playful banter to satisfy audiences willing to pay to play."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,38,"""Mindless"" applies, and Book of Secrets is more like a tame, endlessly repetitive amusement park ride than a motion picture."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,38,"It's another flick about maps, landmarks and buried treasure that makes ""The Da Vinci Code"" look like TOLSTOY."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,38,"Throughout all this, Cage's lazy, dull performance – who knew there were so many ways to express smugness? – is enlivened only by poorly timed bursts of exuberance."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,6.5,219964115,38,Like a grade-school version of an Indiana Jones adventure.
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,100,Ant-Man and the Wasp is a vast improvement on “Ant-Man” (2015) — and one of the most entertaining releases from Marvel Studios.
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,88,"It’s fast, it’s funny, it’s superficial, it’s full of likable stars and scientific mumbo-jumbo, and, above all, it taps into the human urge to see big things become little and little things get big. It’s as close to lizard-brain entertainment as superhero blockbusters get, and as the mercury pushes toward 100, I’ll take it."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,84,"Boasting some of the most creative action scenes and finely-calibrated comedy in the Marvel universe so far, Ant-Man and The Wasp doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it certainly knows how to make the ride even more fun."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,83,"Ant-Man & The Wasp somehow manages to organize laughs, action, theme, small MCU connections and even fairly touching ideas about family, responsibility and what it means to be a hero all housed inside of an undersized blockbuster."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,81,"Given how much of the film is spent on watching tiny items grow to improbable size, and huge objects shrink down to the scale of toys, it seems only appropriate that Ant-Man and the Wasp neatly balances its big, serious concerns with its little petty ones. It’s a movie that understands all the variances of scale, and takes the audience along for the ride as they constantly change."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,It buzzes with uncomplicated enjoyment.
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"Though Rudd and Lilly spark off each other just as appealingly as before, the more urgent point is for Lilly to earn The Wasp her equal billing, which she very much does."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"With well-balanced humour, and a heartfelt father/daughter narrative, Ant-Man and The Wasp makes for refreshing viewing after the gasp-inducing drama of Thanos clicking his fingers. Sometimes, focusing on the smaller stories is just better."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is a hilariously, fun action-flick that takes the edge off the tragic ending of Avengers: Infinity War."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"It’s funny how little things, like personality, can lift a movie. Ant-Man and the Wasp features kinetic action sequences, but what makes it zing is that Mr. Reed has figured out how to sustain the movie’s intimacy and its playfulness, even when bodies and cars go flying."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"The action scenes are complex masterpieces of speed and stunts that combine physical bits with fresh, exciting 3D effects."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"With inventive action and a gag-rate that bests most comedies, Ant-Man and the Wasp is the kind of slick entertainment you’ve come to expect from the MCU, with Rudd and Lilly’s winning double act at the centre."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is a movie of deliberately low stakes and, for that very reason, enormous charm."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is firmly on the B-movie end of the Marvel spectrum, a happy enough place to be: clacking along with all its bug friends, for the moment unfussed about Thanos and geopolitics. It seems pretty nice. Would that we could wrestle the rest of the world down to that same agreeable scale."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"Paul Rudd and his equally likeable cast mates find the heart and humour in familiar comic-book theatrics, resulting in a film which is less concerned with generating awe than in delivering plenty of goofy grins."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"Ant-Man and the Wasp has a pleasingly breakneck, now-you-see-it-now-you-don’t surreal glee. It’s a cunningly swift and delightful comedy of scale."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,78,"Yes, the action sequences are hilarious, and yes, the design department gets to cut gloriously loose with the kaleidoscopic, shifting microverse of the Quantum Realm, but this is first and foremost about family."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"We’re hardly in original territory when a movie relies not once, but twice, on truth-serum humor — but even when things get ultra-corny, “Ant-Man and the Wasp” keeps merrily buzzing along."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,Felt like it was missing something. Something fun. Something small.
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"For some Marvel devotees, Ant-Man and The Wasp will be a clever enough diversion in between the more main-event releases. But it’s pretty much exactly what I’d want in a superhero movie: a funny cast, zippy action scenes and not an infinity stone in sight."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"Ant-Man and the Wasp moves, mainly on the strength of snappy repartee and visuals. Ignore the plot and live in the moment – kind of a quantum concept right there – and it’s entertaining enough."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"Taken in its entirety, Ant-Man and the Wasp may not be the best anything, but, like its perpetually challenged hero, it is plenty good enough."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"Escape means a roller-coaster finish, and with this delightful sequence achieved without the aid of computer effects, this “Ant-Man” entry stakes its own corner of the Marvel Universe sandbox as a throwback to ’80s-style childlike adventure."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"For better and worse, Ant-Man And The Wasp knows it’s small potatoes."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"Ebulliently funny, visually inventive, and above all passionately committed to the idea that heroism isn't a burden but an uplifting realization of our best qualities."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,The thrill of the film is watching Ant-Man and the Wasp team up and raise hell together. Rudd is a winning combination of sass and sincerity. And it's a kick to watch Lilly break out and let her star shine.
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is a two-hour mental break when a lot of people could need a mental break. If this sounds like I’m being condescending to this movie at all, I promise you I am not. I mean this as a huge compliment. It’s so lighthearted and everyone in the movie is so darn pleasant and they all seem to like each other, it kind of feels like the most fictitious Marvel movie to date."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"Despite its considerable charms, Ant-Man and the Wasp is decidedly not a must-see event. In fact, it sometimes feels less like a movie than an episode of an ongoing superhero TV series. But it’s a really, really good episode of that series. And it’s the perfect antidote for the gravity of Infinity War."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"While Ant-Man's technically “the star,” this is most definitely the Wasp’s movie to own, and the smirking, enjoyably no-nonsense role fits Lilly well."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"Visually here’s the crucial thing with Ant-Man and the Wasp, and it sounds like a small thing, but really it’s a big thing: The sequel has upped the instances and exploits of the rapidly changing superheroes, and every time the movie cuts to a shot of the heroes’ miniaturized car, scooting around the streets of San Francisco, it’s good for a laugh."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,72,"For audiences who like Marvel movies at their tongue-in-cheekiest, this sequel provides some breezy fun while we wait to find out just how permanent Thanos’ genocidal schemes really are."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,70,"Ant-Man and the Wasp bets on everything that worked about the first movie—it’s a light and sunny entry in the ongoing Marvel canon that gets by on the cast’s easygoing chemistry. And, of course, on all the shrinking and growing."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,70,"The best thing, though, is the movie’s modest scale. It’s a good-natured epic, dedicated to the nontech principle of dispensing plain old pleasure."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,70,"Much like ""Ant-Man,"" it's a kind of pressure-relief valve, coasting on Paul Rudd's goofy charm. That's more on display than in the first film; returning director Peyton Reed manages not to shrink Rudd's appeal when he shrinks his character."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,70,"It’s busy, harmless fun. Very, very busy."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,70,The result is an effects-laden goofball comedy in which anything goes and nothing matters. Not that this is an entirely plot-free extravaganza or just an excuse for comic riffs. But the filmmakers are so cavalier about the idea that any of this is supposed to make any sense that there's a certain liberation in not burdening two human-brained insects with the fate of the entire universe.
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,70,"Ant-Man And The Wasp is the kind of playtime entertainment suited for Scott Lang's better-when-on-a-team personality, loaded with size-shifty sight gags and lower stakes worth Paul Rudd's ensemble stardom."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,67,"Ant-Man and the Wasp may never achieve that level of surrealist humor, but as a series of amusing quips and inventive setpieces, the rest of the Marvel family could learn a thing or two from the scrappy small-scale of their tiniest colleague."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,67,"The essence of Ant-Man is inherently silly, and that’s where the strength of the new movie lies."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,63,Ant-Man and the Wasp is still beholden to an overwritten superhero/sci-fi storyline that involves lots of quantum talk and way too many players.
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,63,"There’s too much convoluted plot...and the movie at times feels big and ponderous, like Ant-Man when his malfunctioning suit does the opposite of its normal effect.... There are also too few jokes, and though Rudd and Peña work like mad to get laughs, they  come up well short of optimal levels achieved in Thor: Ragnarok."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,63,"As “Guardians” and, later, “Deadpool” doubled down on the snark, “Ant-Man” kept things light, its playfulness made all the more endearing by the boyish, twinkle-eyed persona of its star, Paul Rudd."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,60,"It may not be as significant to the Marvel canon as, say, Black Panther but the skittish wit and playfulness wins us over."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,60,"It has to be more of the same, but better, and the movie doesn’t quite succeed. You can’t really make a bigger, better Ant-Man — that just means defying the diminutive, carefree scale that made the earlier movie work in the first place."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,60,"While it proves an all-round well-mounted distraction, Ant-Man And The Wasp undeniably lacks the scale and ambition of recent Marvel entries."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,60,"Yet that prickly view of fatherhood is what I kept coming back to as the fizz of the movie faded away. It makes Ant-Man and the Wasp feel like something more distinct than just the Ant-Man sequel, and helps it stand out from the other two movies Marvel put out this year."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,60,"It’s disjointed, and cluttered, but it’s also entertaining in spurts. Is that enough? Just about, and not quite. Ant-Man and the Wasp overloads and underachieves, but it also never entirely squanders the first film’s good will."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,60,"It’s about as unassuming as a movie about a man who can grow 65 feet tall could be, and in its relatively subdued scale, it is fairly refreshing and fun."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,58,Ant-Man and the Wasp is working too hard to look unconvincingly relaxed.
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,57,"The movie is ultimately harmless, trivial puffery that vanishes from your brain as quickly as you experience it."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,50,"Good things come in small packages and life’s little pleasures are to be treasured, but Ant Man and The Wasp — together, equal-billed and boring — are too little of a good thing."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,50,"Ant-Man and the Wasp offers nothing close to what we have come to expect from entries into the MCU. Plodding, repetitive, replete with technobabble nonsense and lifeless action, this is easily the worst-written of any of the 20 MCU offerings and may be the worst all-around film featuring a Marvel superhero since Sony rebooted Spider-Man."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,50,"There’s a lot going on here, which leads to a whole lot of gassy exposition to explain it all.... Think of it as torture by blah-blah."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,50,"Reed, a comedic wizard, generates some moments of giddy wonder, but the earlier film’s freewheeling, low-key loopiness is replaced by a dull and dutiful plot that, with its forced references to other Marvel installments, squeezes the action to fit the franchise."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,50,"The first flick had a lot going for it: clever cinematography, a refreshing irreverence and Paul Rudd’s boyish charm. But “Wasp” is scant, man."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,40,Even Peña and an able supporting cast that boasts a bear-hugging Bobby Cannavale are hamstrung by a script where too many jokes fall flat.
X2,7.4,214949694,90,"The fantastic and at times deliciously nihilistic world of X2 is fully, believably three-dimensional."
X2,7.4,214949694,90,"A diverting mix of insight and spectacle, human and superhuman. This machine is built for kids, but rarely do words like ""noble,"" ""Hollywood"" and ""rawkin'"" all apply to one movie."
X2,7.4,214949694,89,"An altogether more viscerally engaging film, from its relentless pacing and slam-bang effects work to the fine, appropriately heroic score by John Ottman. That the movie has an obvious gay subtext neither adds nor detracts from the films smashing popcorn appeal."
X2,7.4,214949694,88,"A follow-up with as much artistic integrity, complexity, humor and well-designed action as the original."
X2,7.4,214949694,88,"One of the things that makes this movie such a great rush is that while youre watching it, it seems a good deal more subversive than it really is."
X2,7.4,214949694,88,Captures the feel of a first-rate comic book. It puts the pop back into Pop Art: It blows viewers away with a blast of kinetic energy.
X2,7.4,214949694,83,"It also boosts the punch of the movie that so many of its action scenes evoke the Iraqi War news footage of the past month, and the ""X-Men"" premise -- people persecuted because their difference makes them seem threatening -- carries even more relevancy and weight than it did three years ago."
X2,7.4,214949694,83,X2 sparkles with a lightness of spirit that was missing from ''X-Men.''
X2,7.4,214949694,80,"My chief complaint is that these mutants are a little--well, vanilla. I wish the X-Men had a touch of kinkiness to go with their weird abilities."
X2,7.4,214949694,80,"About twice as good as the original...bigger and more ambitious in every respect, from its action and visceral qualities to its themes."
X2,7.4,214949694,80,"Funny, reasonably crazy, and unpretentiously faithful to its source."
X2,7.4,214949694,80,"Directed with depth, efficiency, and wit by Bryan Singer, the film suffered only from a tendency to seem like a setup for an even bigger movie...Fortunately, bigger usually equals better here, and when it doesn't, it equals just as good."
X2,7.4,214949694,80,"Brisk and involving with a streamlined forward propulsion, it's the kind of superhero movie we want if we have to have superhero movies at all."
X2,7.4,214949694,75,"Perhaps in the next generation a mutant will appear named Scribbler, who can write a better screenplay for them."
X2,7.4,214949694,75,"As irresistible as movie-theater popcorn - a lavish, reasonably intelligent, well-acted sequel with kick-butt effects that outdoes its predecessor, 2000's ""X-Men,"" in almost every department."
X2,7.4,214949694,75,"A summer firecracker. It's also a tribute to outcasts -- teens, gays, minorities, even Dixie Chicks. It's not without thought or feeling, except when its mind gets bent by the gods of box office. Then it's craven and empty."
X2,7.4,214949694,75,"A sleek, rousing contraption, a comic-book movie with a sense of playfulness, a welcome streak of humor and just the right touch of gravity."
X2,7.4,214949694,75,"Visually, X2 is a sight to behold, with impressive special effects and a dynamic sense of place."
X2,7.4,214949694,75,"As it is, most of X2's action is restricted to the Northeast Corridor, with a climactic face-off in the western Rockies, where, in typical blockbuster fashion, everything goes kablooey and ka-bam."
X2,7.4,214949694,75,This movie lets the characters and tropes borrowed from the original Stan Lee comic live and breathe.
X2,7.4,214949694,70,"As in the first movie, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart are trotted out periodically to add a little gravitas."
X2,7.4,214949694,70,"Wants to contain multitudes -- high ideals and high tech, the poignant and the silly. Doing so, it becomes a lexicon of modern filmmaking. It could be its own creature: Super-Generico. That's not the worst thing for a movie to be, but it's not quite Marvel-ous either."
X2,7.4,214949694,70,"In some ways, X2 is an obvious improvement on its predecessor: It looks more expensive, and its special effects seem to swoop out of nowhere...But ""X-Men"" was undoubtedly the most elegiac comic-book adaptation of the past few years."
X2,7.4,214949694,70,"Mr. Singer and his collaborators grasp that comic books, for all their obligatory fights and explosions, are at bottom about their brave, troubled, impossibly muscled characters."
X2,7.4,214949694,70,The combat visuals that follow are as powerful as those of any war film.
X2,7.4,214949694,67,An engaging spectacle of energy and special effects built around a doomy mood and an ensemble cast vigorously pursuing a story line that isn't nearly as snazzy as the dressing.
X2,7.4,214949694,63,"It's scenic, confidently directed and performed, dutiful, faithful, revelatory, informative, and largely involving. Rarely, however, is it any fun."
X2,7.4,214949694,63,There's a continuing delicacy to [Singer's] direction that gives the audience room to breathe and reason to linger. This may not be a grownup movie but -- unlike the Star Wars franchise or the Batman sequels -- it is a movie that grownups can watch minus the requisite bottle of Excedrin.
X2,7.4,214949694,63,"A substantial improvement over ""X-Men,"" in many ways, especially in visual and specialeffects departments."
X2,7.4,214949694,63,"The longer the movie goes, the more its 133 minutes prove wearing. The story tries to develop a love angle between Jackman and Janssen, but it doesn't begin to take. And the finale is particularly weak."
X2,7.4,214949694,60,The best new addition to the corp is Alan Cummings Nightcrawler.
X2,7.4,214949694,60,"Singer's approach to X2 is very much of the ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" school, resulting in a movie that, even at its best -- a thrilling jailbreak scene that's the closest thing in either X movie to a rousing set piece -- seems tame and unmemorable."
X2,7.4,214949694,50,"What the movie needs more than anything is a script. The story is very disappointing and near the end, things start to get weirder and weirder."
X2,7.4,214949694,40,"Of the many comic book superhero movies, this is by far the lamest, the loudest, the longest. Good Lord, what an epic sit. My rear end deserves a medal...I wish I could say it wasn't so, but for most of us, this ""X"" marks a splat."
X2,7.4,214949694,30,"The movie is overplotted, a soulless maze of special effects and relentless action."
Venom,6.7,213515506,75,This leaves the viewer with two choices: reject the parasite or let it take you over. Fight it off and you’ll have a bad time; become one with it and you may achieve a kind of symbiosis.
Venom,6.7,213515506,70,"The action is dumb, the plot is weak, and the story is pitiful. Venom is a bad movie, yet surprisingly I still loved the hell out of it."
Venom,6.7,213515506,70,"For several weird stretches, though, Venom is a bouncy good time. The movie doesn’t seem to care if you’re laughing with it, at it, or whatever. Just as long as you’re engaged, rollicking along as it doles out fan-service while still making a gleeful hash of so many serious franchise movies about very silly things."
Venom,6.7,213515506,63,"It's a mess, but wow, is it ever a fun, fascinating mess. Those are always so much more thrilling than any of the formulaic superhero movies that parade through multiplexes all year."
Venom,6.7,213515506,60,"Much of the picture falls flat, but the Eddie/Venom dynamic is aces and lives up to the Zombieland legacy."
Venom,6.7,213515506,60,"Fleischer made a better comedy-horror with Zombieland, but Venom’s a decent buddy actioner. You might even laugh your head off."
Venom,6.7,213515506,58,"Venom isn’t quite bad, but it’s not exactly good either. It’s noncommittally mediocre and, as a result, forgettable. It just sort of sits there, beating you numb, unsure of whether it wants to be a comic-book movie or put the whole idea of comic-book movies in its crosshairs."
Venom,6.7,213515506,55,"Venom is, at its heart, a will-they-won’t-they story—a grisly meet-cute between a down-on-his-luck reporter and a grumpy, gloppy little extra-terrestrial with a really big appetite. That’s good, because the movie is barely competent as an action flick."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"Neither the most super-awesome Marvel movie nor the worst. It exists in that micro-millimeter’s breadth of in-between. Venom has energy, style and Tom Hardy — all good things. But it doesn’t really make sense, a bad thing."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"The film’s off-kilter schizophrenia gives it a madcap appeal. While Fleischer seems to have a darker, moodier film in mind, Hardy has the good sense to steer Venom in a more over-the-top direction, even if the movie around him can’t catch up."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"As a symbiote, Brock/Venom is sometimes funny, and for a while the movie finds a rhythm that seems to suit director Ruben Fleischer, best known for Zombieland."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"In the end, Venom exists in what may end up being regarded as a no-man’s land — too much like a superhero movie to appeal to people who despise the genre, and yet too deliberately silly to be taken seriously by superhero fans. There’s nothing memorable in Venom, nothing to talk about the next day. But if it happens to hit you right, its lightness is refreshing."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"To the extent that Venom works, it’s as a comedy not an action/adventure superhero film."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"Ultimately, the ingratiating eccentricities of Venom aren’t enough to really distinguish the movie from its superhero-movie brethren as it devolves into the usual expensive orgy of sound, fury and wisecracking."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"So of course, Hardy applies that same intensity to the comic-book anti-hero origin story, Venom. And his fully committed performance is pretty much the only reason to see it."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"The best moments toy with a kind of superhero body horror, but the movie never fully commits to that angle, maybe to appease a ratings board and perceived audience of 13-year-olds (isn’t that who Venom was designed to please?), or maybe because director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) is more interested in the comic possibilities than the horrific ones."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"Like his hungry symbiote latching onto Eddie, Fleischer cunningly fastens a malicious irreverence onto an otherwise lacklustre superhero movie. But the symbiosis doesn’t quite take."
Venom,6.7,213515506,42,"To be honest, Venom’s almost worth watching for Hardy’s bizarre accent and whirling-dervish mania alone, but it’s a shame he’s not surrounded by a better, more exciting film."
Venom,6.7,213515506,42,"It’s a cliché to praise a film by saying that an actor “is having fun” on screen, but Hardy having fun with a weirdly bland character and his absurd, sassy alter ego goes a long way to giving Venom a reason to exist."
Venom,6.7,213515506,41,"It’s a train wreck of a movie, mixing and matching wildly dissonant tones, bizarre plot contrivances, and a truly unique lead performance."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"At least the CGI is clever, the consistency of Venom’s viscous, hostless form moving between molten metal and melted chewing gum."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,Venom is a desperately confused piece of work which has only a few compensatory pleasures to offer along the way.
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"Despite a commendably committed performance from Tom Hardy (whether it's a good or bad one will still need further evaluation), Venom's a big, stinking gooey mess of a film."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"No one can accuse Hardy of giving Venom anything less than his absolute best. He has always been a performer who loves a good affectation; here he seems to be riffing on his performance as Max Rockatansky in ""Mad Max: Fury Road."""
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"Venom wants to be something different, an off-kilter dark comedy whose protagonist doesn’t need to be cleaned up so he can fight alongside Iron Man someday. But it’s also terrified to step out of line, and the stench of fear overwhelms whatever wisps of fresh air have sneaked through the cracks in the doorway."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"Entertainingly, Hardy lets himself get jerked around, Evil Dead–style, but he’s never enough of a jerk—so much for that journo-snoop backstory—and Venom isn’t vicious enough to justify its own existence."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"Venom is neither triumph nor train-wreck. It’s a mediocre origin story, a superhero host that sadly fails to bond with its comedy parasite. Which is a shame, as there is enough here to to suggest it could have been a blast."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"If you are going to Venom for cool superhero action — or for compelling characters, pulpy science-fiction, impressive special effects, a parable about corporations run amok, or a single significant connection to Spider-Man — you will be sorely disappointed. If you can look past all of that (and the dreadful first hour), your reward is Hardy, delivering one of the all-time great unhinged performances."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"I do want to make it clear that I think Venom is not a good movie, but I also want to make it clear that I had the time of my life watching it. I think in a couple of years Venom could be the type of movie that sells out midnight showings as people come up to the screen and act out their favorite parts."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"Directed with flat, joyless competence by Ruben Fleischer (“Zombieland,” “Gangster Squad”), “Venom” brings with it a laborious, decades-spanning development history. A movie this long in the works should arrive on-screen feeling like more than just an afterthought."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"Venom is a textbook case of a comic-book film that’s unexciting in its ho-hum competence, and even its visual-effects bravura."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"Tom Hardy’s committed performance can’t overcome a painful script and indecisive direction, resulting in a film with a personality that’s as split as its titular character. There are occasional moments of brilliance in the dynamic between Eddie and Venom that give a hint of what the film could have been in steadier hands, but ultimately, that only makes the finished product a more frustrating viewing experience."
Venom,6.7,213515506,38,"Venom, the movie, is a reptilian Marvel mishmash whose touch saps the life force of almost everyone in it."
Venom,6.7,213515506,38,A picture in the running for the dubious distinction of being perhaps the worst Marvel-derived origin story ever.
Venom,6.7,213515506,38,"Tom Hardy is one of the best actors in the world, but as he flounders his way through Venom, we’re reminded even the finest talents can sink under the weight of a terrible movie."
Venom,6.7,213515506,38,"I mean, we all love Tom Hardy, but he can’t break through in this thinly-scripted, dully acted and badly directed Marvel comic brought to life."
Venom,6.7,213515506,30,"The direction by Ruben Fleischer (Zomebieland, Gangster Squad) is oddly slapdash, and hardly does justice to the skills of his cast or his own chops as a comedic filmmaker. Hardy squeezes some baffled comedy out of his schizoid shtick, but there just isn’t much here for him to work with."
Venom,6.7,213515506,25,The final act's full-tilt embrace of action effectively undermines Tom Hardy's flashes of actorly idiosyncrasy.
Venom,6.7,213515506,25,"“Venom”? More like cyanide. The latest movie off the Marvel assembly line is a disaster on every level, from the hatchet-job writing to the horrid performances. Like so many recent superhero movies, Venom has put its focus on juvenile humor instead of heart or action."
Venom,6.7,213515506,25,"Venom isn’t sure what film it wants to be, and it makes for an unintelligible, queasy roller coaster ride."
Venom,6.7,213515506,20,"This year gave us the best and most imaginative Marvel film in ""Black Panther."" Now we have the worst."
Venom,6.7,213515506,20,"Venom can be quite a lively watch, both as a reminder of why Hollywood stopped making superhero films like this, and also for the occasional glimpse of the off-the-wall, star-driven freak-out that might have been.... But in terms of basic entertainment, let alone as the foundation of a franchise, it is miserably shaky stuff."
Venom,6.7,213515506,20,"Venom feels like a throwback, a poor second cousin to the all-stars that have reliably dominated the box-office charts for most of this century. Partly, this is due to the fact that, as an origin story, this one seems rote and unimaginative. On top of that, the writing and filmmaking are blah in every respect; the film looks like an imitator, a wannabe, not the real deal."
Venom,6.7,213515506,20,"There are in fact one or two big gags, but no real sense of fun - not compared to something like Thor: Ragnarok. Director Ruben Fleischer, who made Zombieland and Gangster Squad, is uninspired. Venom is riddled with the poison of dullness."
Venom,6.7,213515506,15,"It exists as a waste of time (although, one hopes, a sizable payday) for some very talented actors, and it’s proof that even Marvel doesn’t always get it right."
Venom,6.7,213515506,12,"Where to even begin with Venom, a film that had me laughing at it so hard I started crying. A horribly scripted film so bad as to be enjoyable, but not bad enough to be good."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,90,"Puerile, pitiful, grotesque, offensive, immature, repulsive and, of course, extremely funny."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,90,Mike Myers unleashes (or seems to unleash) the entire contents of his comic mind.
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,90,"Mike Myers is like a rich 12-year-old who rents out F.A.O. Schwartz, upends every toy in under two hours, and brings in strippers. He can get away with this privileged romp because he grooves on what he does in a way that none of his contemporaries -- can comprehend."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,88,"The funniest, crassest, wildest, most musical, most satirical and most scatological of the Powers trilogy. And you get to watch Britney Spears' head explode. What more could you want?"
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,83,You go into an Austin Powers movie with a big grin on -- or at least you should. The charm of this one is that you leave smiling even more broadly.
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,80,"Like a giant balloon painted with Day-Glo colors, however, the whole gaudy mess wouldn't inflate without the force of Mr. Myers's comic genius. It's his baby, baby. And after three editions, it's still flying high."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,80,"It's a mess, and a ridiculous golden shower of toilet humor. But Mike Myers' superspy spoof still provides the summer's purest movie delight."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,75,The most consistently funny of the ''Austin Powers'' films.
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,75,This summer's comic gem.
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,75,"Mike Myers and Austin Powers may stick to their old Beatle boots, but they've both come a long way, luvvy. For proof, just look at all the A-list celebrities-I-won't-mention happy to crash the party."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,75,"Myers's sheer fertility of invention is of a different order, and even if he misses as often as he hits, he's definitely a swinger."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,75,"The best way to look at this installment, however, is as musical theater of the absurd. The song-and-dance set pieces are brilliant, including a rap-style ""It's a Hard Knock Life"" in a prison."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,70,"Caine is burlesquing his own iconography and enjoying every minute of it. He hasn't lost his dignity, though; it takes a lot of self-possession to act this blissfully silly. He even looks good with bad teeth."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,70,"Not since the heyday of Fellini, I dare say, has there been such a merrygoround of a movie."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,70,"The latest installment in the Austin Powers series has stopped making much sense at all, but it sure gets its giggle on, and good."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,70,"It's often quite funny (when it's not spinning its wheels in rehashed skits and recycled gags), but when Myers gets his mojo working and his mind out of the toilet, he's capable of better."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,67,"Austin does have a psychedelic buoyancy and Dr. Evil an addle-pated sadistic goofiness that are original and engaging, but Myers doesn't build on their best stuff. That's where a real plot would help."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,67,"It's a shapeless, derivative-but-funny show with another loony parody plot about super-villain Dr. Evil."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,63,"In all fairness to the film, it is superior to the disappointing second movie in the series. The comedy is about as low-brow as it can get (at least without treading into R-rated territory)."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,63,"Uneven, self-conscious but often hilarious spoof."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,63,"With the jokes coming about one per second, you're bound to find something to laugh at. I found myself laughing a lot--even as I began to feel the whole thing wearing thin."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,63,"A picture that, even more than the previous two, feels like a bunch of gags tossed together. The laughs are here, to be sure, although even some of the best of them are retreads and the Swinging '60s recycling act is now feeling a bit past its zeitgeist prime."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,60,"The gifted Myers lets his once and (I hope) future shag king get lost in an elephantine Hollywood franchise. The first time was the charm, baby."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,60,"The laugh always comes first, and Myers' puppy-dog tenacity to that cast-iron tenet of low comedy, disarming and even somewhat charming in the first film, now has an air of careerist desperation about it."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,50,"A step or two down from the first and second, but it has some very funny moments, and maybe that is all we hope for."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,50,Casting Caine as Austin's father is a stroke of pure genius.
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,50,"The only thing that won't make you laugh, unless you've got a 12-year-old's sense of humor, is the film's tireless parade of gross-out gags and scatological verbal jests. Myers gets a charge out of this material--it wouldn't be here if he didn't--but so much of it is so tedious it's difficult to believe an adult actually sat down and wrote it."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,50,"The uneven Goldmember seems to take a big step toward the extremely juvenile, with more scatological and fewer sex jokes"
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,50,Star/writer Mike Myers and director Jay Roach struggle visibly with exhausted possibilities and diminishing returns.
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,50,"To paraphrase one of the few memorable lines in the movie, ""Even stink would say this stinks."""
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,40,Goldmember comes after years of escalating vulgarity have thrown the need for caution -- and cleverness -- out of fashion.
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,38,"Myers returns as his menagerie of repulsive characters, but this time, his frantic mugging feels more like an insipid parlor trick than ever."
300,7.7,210614939,100,"We've seen plenty of sword-and-sandal epics, full of robustly virile men fighting like real men against other men. But we've never seen those hyper-macho mechanics presented with the brutal beauty and thrilling finesse of 300, clearly the best film of 2007 so far."
300,7.7,210614939,83,"Director Zack Snyder uses his computers to create ferocious and painterly images, with as much attention to each frame as a hand-drawn panel."
300,7.7,210614939,80,"A newfangled old-fashioned movie about glory, honor, sacrifice and a martial code that crosses into fascism, homoerotism and homophobia at the same time -- there are plenty of turn-off buttons in this one. But by Zeus, this is a ripping yarn, told with limb-rending gusto, an iconic ancient battle as seen by an iconic comic-book creator, Frank Miller."
300,7.7,210614939,80,"300 is a feast for the senses (well, two of them anyway) and an impressive technical achievement. More than that, it's a hell of a lot of fun."
300,7.7,210614939,78,"Not since Mario Bava's ""Hercules in the Haunted World"" has Greco-Roman movie-house mythmaking been so thoroughly well-conceived and executed."
300,7.7,210614939,75,"300 may not offer masterful storytelling in a conventional sense, but it's hard to beat as a spectacle and that makes it worthwhile viewing for all but the most squeamish of potential audience members."
300,7.7,210614939,75,"Look, but don't be touched: There is much to see but little to remember in this telling of a battle we are meant never to forget."
300,7.7,210614939,75,300 is a movie blood-drunk on its own artful excess. Guys of all ages and sexes won't be able to resist it.
300,7.7,210614939,75,300 is a huge step forward in visually sophisticated storytelling.
300,7.7,210614939,75,Cinema has once again proven its ability to incorporate every other mass-media art form. Director Zack Snyder and his computer wizards have made the best example yet of the movie-as-comic-book.
300,7.7,210614939,75,It's impossible not to be moved by its nearly nonstop visual assault.
300,7.7,210614939,75,"Significantly, this hyper-stylization of 300 is limited to its visuals. The performances are played straight, and this combination -- straight performances and stylized visuals -- produces an uncanny effect."
300,7.7,210614939,75,"It may not be by-the-book history -- a relative term in any event, when discussing the ancients whose worldview embraced men, gods and monsters -- but what a spectacle!"
300,7.7,210614939,70,"In epic battle scenes where he combines breathtaking and fluid choreography, gorgeous 3-D drawings and hundreds of visual effects, director Zack Snyder puts onscreen the seemingly impossible heroism and gore of which Homer sang in ""The Iliad."""
300,7.7,210614939,70,The movie swings back and forth from awesome to awful so regularly and rapidly that it's like a jai alai match.
300,7.7,210614939,67,"This is a mixed blessing. For a story replete with open-air combat 300 is strangely claustrophobic. And for a film with lotsa flesh and even more blood, it's light on flesh-and-blood characters."
300,7.7,210614939,63,"300 is at its best when it settles for purely visceral thrills, such as Leonidas' battle against a hulking warrior twice the size of a normal man. The movie's broad strokes are all superlative: It's the details that keep 300 from being anything more than a striking curiosity."
300,7.7,210614939,63,"The action epic 300 is so overblown, overheated and over the top that on some level, it's fun to get caught up in the operatic dizziness of it."
300,7.7,210614939,63,"A blustery, bombastic, visually arresting account of the Battle of Thermopylae as channeled through the rabid imagination of graphic novelist Frank Miller."
300,7.7,210614939,60,"Visually stunning, thoroughly belligerent and as shallow as a pygmy’s paddling pool, this is a whole heap of style tinged with just a smidgen of substance."
300,7.7,210614939,60,"300 is ""Gladiator"" for the gamer set."
300,7.7,210614939,50,Just about everything in this pea-brained epic is overscaled and overwrought – it's a cartoon trying to be a towering triptych.
300,7.7,210614939,50,"300 is something to see, but unless you love violence as much as a Spartan, Quentin Tarantino or a video-game-playing teenage boy, you will not be endlessly fascinated."
300,7.7,210614939,50,That it's so flat as an action movie probably has a lot to do with why people might prefer to jawbone over its putatively controversial aspects--there's really not much of a “wow” factor to revel in.
300,7.7,210614939,50,"There's a stale, synthetic airlessness about the movie. Imagine a large cast trapped in a series of spectacular screensavers. It could be ancient Greece. It could be somebody's hard drive."
300,7.7,210614939,50,"The disconnect between the human actors and the digital backgrounds is more pronounced here than in a futuristic adventure like ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,"" and because classic Hollywood cinema is so rich with epic images of antiquity, this can't help but seem chintzy."
300,7.7,210614939,50,"Sensory gluttony is reason enough to see a movie, and few epics overstuff the eyes like this one."
300,7.7,210614939,50,"Part of the fascination of the Thermopylae story is that it really happened, and it helped define real heroism. There's nothing remotely like reality to be had in this film."
300,7.7,210614939,50,"My deepest objection to the movie is that it is so blood-soaked. When dialogue arrives to interrupt the carnage, it's like the seventh-inning stretch."
300,7.7,210614939,50,"It has to be said that there is a level of cheerfully self-aware ridiculousness, which means that 300 is not entirely without entertainment value."
300,7.7,210614939,50,"A fun-sapped maelstrom without meaning, 300 simply pummels you with endless loops of battle-porn. While you couldn’t classify the movie as entertainment, it might have a long, prosperous future as a Clockwork Orange–style Ludovico Technique."
300,7.7,210614939,40,"300 will be talked about as a technical achievement, the next blip on the increasingly blurry line between movies and video games."
300,7.7,210614939,40,"The bigger question to ask about 300 is why, for a supposedly rousing tale of heroism, it's so curiously unaffecting."
300,7.7,210614939,40,"Snyder attaches no larger significance to his arresting visuals. He’s only intent on eliciting “Whoa, dude!” reactions, of which there are fewer and fewer once it becomes clear that there’s nothing sustaining the centerpiece razzle-dazzle sequences except awful dialogue and no-dimensional characters."
300,7.7,210614939,40,"As you watch -- no, endure -- this flattened-out spectacle, there's really nothing worth pondering save for a single thought: What a difference a director makes."
300,7.7,210614939,38,"It's kind of a ghastly hoot, and while I suppose it does no harm, it also contributes nothing. It's a guilty unpleasantness."
300,7.7,210614939,38,"Another movie -- Matt Stone and Trey Parker's ""Team America,"" whose wooden puppets were more compelling actors than most of the cast of 300 -- calculated the cost [of freedom] at $1.05. I would happily pay a nickel less, in quarters or arcade tokens, for a vigorous 10-minute session with the video game that 300 aspires to become."
300,7.7,210614939,30,"300 presents a dual clash of civilizations. An action adventure that pits thousands of Persians against 300 brave Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae, it also pits millions of fans of brainless violence against a gallant band, or so I choose to think of us, who still expect movies to contain detectable traces of humanity."
300,7.7,210614939,30,"Pop has always drawn energy from the lower floors of respectability; this movie, in which fan-boy cultism reaches new levels of goofy chaos and sexual confusion, draws energy from the subbasement."
300,7.7,210614939,30,"It's a ponderous, plodding, visually dull picture, but the blame shouldn't be put on Snyder's skills per se, and has nothing to do with his ambition to blur the distinction between CGI and photography. Frankly, it's the slavish, frame-by-frame devotion to Miller's source material that's the problem."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,80,Downey has a winning take on Holmes: He's always on.
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,75,"Hey, remember “fun”? If you’re sick of the apocalypse and tortured anti-heroes, then you need to see Sherlock Holmes. It’s a blast from start to finish."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,75,"The less I thought about Sherlock Holmes, the more I liked ""Sherlock Holmes."" Yet another classic hero has been fed into the f/x mill, emerging as a modern superman."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,75,"It pleases me to report, then, that Downey brings his brain, his wit, and his gift for intelligent underplaying, even as he understands he has been hired to play Sherlock Holmes, action hero."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,75,This is very much a Sherlock Holmes movie for the blockbuster era.
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,70,"Ritchie has never worked on a scale anything approaching this before and, while some of the directorial affectations are distracting, he keeps the action humming."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,70,"Challenged by Downey’s energy, Jude Law, who often seems aimless in his movies, comes fully up to speed. He’s virile and quick-witted, and his Watson, if not Holmes’s equal in brainpower, comes close to him in daring. Their repartee evokes the banter of lovers in a screwball comedy; they flirt outrageously but chastely."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,70,"There's a mystery at the heart of Sherlock Holmes, and it's not the one the great master of detection has been called on to solve. It's how a film that has so many good things going for it has turned out to be solid but not spectacular."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,70,"The movie as a whole is clever, and conspicuously overwrought. But Mr. Downey's performance is elegantly wrought; he's as quick-witted as his legendary character, and blithely funny in the lovers' spats—all right, the mystery-lovers' spats—that Holmes keeps having with Jude Law's witty Dr. Watson."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,70,"There are worse things than loutish, laddish cool, and as a series of poses and stunts, Sherlock Holmes is intermittently diverting."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,70,"Entertaining in a glossy, mindless way."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,67,"Sherlock Holmes is an odd amalgam, a top-heavy light entertainment that keeps throwing things at you and doesn't seem too concerned with whether they stick."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,67,"Here's hoping that younger members of the audience will seek out Conan Doyle's original stories to further explore Holmes' official amanuensis, Dr. John Watson, whose brilliant case studies regarding his friend, roommate, and fellow rationalist are the stuff dreams are made of."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,63,"The reason Sherlock Holmes fails at least as often as it succeeds is because more effort and attention was lavished upon the concept than upon the script. Given a worthy story, Downey's Holmes might have been memorable. Here, he's an interesting character in search of a worthwhile story."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,63,"The result is only half as hip as hoped. Yes, this Holmes is leaner and meaner, and Watson (Jude Law) is nearly his equal. But there’s still something fussy about the result, as if bobbies had broken up the party at 11:59."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,63,Sherlock Holmes has been reimagined with fighting skills as potent as his intellectual acumen.
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,63,"Ritchie and company spend too much time being cute and not enough time being clever, resulting in a one-dimensional comic-book version of Doyle's detectives."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,60,"A fun, action-packed reintroduction to Conan Doyle's classic characters. Part Two should provide more in the way of scope."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,60,"In short, Ritchie's come up with precisely what you'd expect of him — a pumped-up, anachronistically modern Sherlock Holmes designed for the ADD crowd. Expect a sequel. Or six."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,60,"By now we’ve seen so many good, bad, and indifferent Sherlocks that it’s almost a relief to get something different, however wrongheaded. And there’s no such thing as too much Downey."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,50,"Ritchie is all about the whooshing and headbanging, leaving no space between Holmes' words to savor their meaning. Downey is irresistible. The movie, not so much."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,50,"As over-emphatic as one might expect from the ham-fisted Guy Ritchie, this resurrection of the world's most famous detective is a dank, noisy affair."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,50,"Not even Sherlock Holmes could make much sense out of the overplotted, murky mess that is ""Sherlock Holmes,"" although Arthur Conan Doyle's legendarily brainy detective would probably never buy a ticket to a movie as elephant-footed as this one."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,50,"With a clamorous soundtrack and a whirl of elaborate chases and busily choreographed fight scenes, this is Sherlock Holmes with Attention Deficit Disorder."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,50,"Despite some arresting visual flourishes and Downey’s inherent likeability, it’s nearly incoherent both as cinema and as story.  No, this isn’t your grandfather’s or your father’s Sherlock Holmes, but if theirs featured Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Brett in the lead, it was better by miles."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,50,"Guy Ritchie is the worst screenwriter in the world, but, to be fair, he is not the worst director. He is only the worst director of the people who actually get to make movies."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,50,"Guy Ritchie's Holmes reboot feels both too complicated and too elementary, dear Watson."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,42,This is certainly the grubbiest Holmes in movie history.
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,40,Sherlock Holmes goes wrong in many ways except for one -- at the boxoffice.
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,40,"This is the ultimate sin of the film, generically helmed by lad-auteur Guy Ritchie: Logic seems to be thrown out the window in order to make room for clashes on a partially completed Tower Bridge. It’s way too elementary."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,38,It's a serious drag to see how Ritchie has turned Holmes and Dr. Watson into a couple of garden-variety thugs.
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,38,"Sherlock Holmes dumbs down a century-old synonym for intelligence with S&M gags, witless sarcasm, murky bombast and twirling action-hero moves that belong in a ninja flick."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,38,"This ""Holmes"" is just about as silly as it awesome. At times, Ritchie and company try so hard to make sure this isn't your father's ""Sherlock Holmes"" that it comes across as, well, cartoonish."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,30,"The very idea of handing him over to professional lad Guy Ritchie (who directed Snatch, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), to be played as a punch-throwing quipster by Robert Downey Jr., is so profoundly stupid one can only step back in dismay."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,100,"The film forges ahead, in vivid 3-D, with such energy, expertise and thunderous conviction that you readily accept its basic premise — the pell-mell emergence of great intelligence, plus moral awareness, in primitive bodies — and find yourself exactly where the filmmakers want you to be, swinging giddily between sympathy for the apes and the humans in what threatens to become all-out war."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,100,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is awe-inspiring.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,100,"Yet for all of the technological genius at work here, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes maintains a remarkably human core, even under digital makeup."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,100,"""Dawn"" is not just a good genre movie or a good summer movie. It's a great science-fiction film, full-stop, and one of the year's very best movies so far."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,100,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes manages to do at least three things exceptionally well that are hard enough to pull off individually: Maintain a simmering level of tension without let-up for two hours, seriously improve on a very good first entry in a franchise and produce a powerful humanistic statement using a significantly simian cast of characters."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,100,"An altogether smashing sequel to 2011′s better-than-expected “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” this vivid, violent extension of humanoid ape Caesar’s troubled quest for independence bests its predecessor in nearly every technical and conceptual department."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,91,"Director Matt Reeves, working from a script by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver and Mark Bomback, elevates the apes to primary importance in this intelligent thriller."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,91,"In truth, the deeply absorbing and thematically rich ‘Apes’ sequel is more akin to a drama than an action film, but it's one that still satisfies the desires and demands of big, blockbuster filmmaking."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,90,"“Dawn” is more than a bunch of occasionally thrilling action sequences, emotional gut punches and throwaway jokes arranged in predictable sequence. It is technically impressive and viscerally exciting, for sure, but it also gives you a lot to think, and even to care, about."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,90,Serkis’ Caesar gets more than his fair share of rip-snortin’ badass moments. He’s arguably the finest leader of men we’ve seen on screen since “Lincoln.”
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,88,"Loud, smart and ferociously committed to its premise, and it leaves an intriguingly bitter aftertaste."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,88,"This installment inches events closer to a merge point with 1968's ""Planet of the Apes"" while maintaining its own unique identity. It is in every way superior to ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."""
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,88,"Good news – it’s incredible. It sets the standard for blockbuster action movies, and manages to be even better than its predecessor."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,88,This is an “Apes” for the ages.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,88,"It's a provocative sci-fi action film with dynamite special effects, a powerful humanistic theme with echoes of real-life social conflicts, and a truly wondrous performance by Serkis."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,88,"For two hours of breathless drama, you forget you’re watching actors grunting like chimps and hope two rival civilizations can work together."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,83,What’s striking about this new film is that it lays out the message-mongering in such a way that you can enjoy the movie equally well on a purely action level.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,83,It speaks to the masses with some treats for the discerning types in the back.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,83,A sequel that easily tops its 2011 predecessor.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"A satisfying balance of family drama, political intrigue and all-out action (an ape cavalry charge has to be seen to be believed) do, in truth, only constitute half of the story, as Reeves' sci-fi sequel is as much a technical triumph as a narrative one."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"A superbly mounted, powerfully performed, if slightly underfed Apes sequel. That Reeves is set to direct Untitled Of The Planet Of The Apes next is cause for much celebration. This guy’s fur real. No pun intended."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"Even given the spate of post-apocalyptic and dystopian films that rule the multiplexes, this is the bleakest “franchise” in human history, and I’m curious if there will be any balm whatsoever in the next close encounter of the furred kind."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,Makes for riveting viewing. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is among the more brisk 2 hours and 10 minutes I've spent in a theater in some time -- and it's easily the most rewarding of this year's summer tentpole films.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"Yet for all the heady ideas at play, Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes remains a visceral film, one of movement, action, unexpected developments, and disarming poignance."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"Eschewing a tidy wrap-up, Reeves doesn't leave us feeling manipulated, as so often happens in films like this. Instead, we want to know where the story goes from here, and that's no small accomplishment."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a much better and far less silly movie than its predecessor.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"Not quite the intimate parable of the first movie nor a balls-to-the-wall battlefield extravaganza, Dawn is pitched somewhere in the middle, with much of its two hour-plus running time powered by the simmering, expertly sustained tension both between and within the two species."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"Just as 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes surpassed expectations, so this sequel delivers on its promise and leaves us wanting more – which we'll almost certainly get."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"It may lack its predecessor’s lofty ambitions, but once the bullets, spears and hairy fists start flying you’ll be too wrapped up to care."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"There's evident patience and intelligence to the filmmaking all over, as well as an engagement with genuine ideas about diplomacy, deterrence, law and leadership. However often it risks monkey-mad silliness, it's impressively un-stupid."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,78,"The narrative and its attendant lessons about how one rotten ape and/or human can spoil the bunch are engaging, although I found myself drifting during the battle sequences."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,75,The apes and the special effects team are the real stars of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,75,"Visually, this movie is big, bold, often awe-inspiring."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,75,"In one of the most wickedly funny scenes in sci-fi history, Koba uses monkeyshines to bamboozle some gun-toting yahoos and scuttle the peace treaty."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,75,"Whatever audiences think of it, I'd say the latest ""Apes"" picture is just that: a solid success, sharing many of its predecessor's swift, exciting storytelling and motion-capture technology virtues."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,75,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes works both as allegory and action-adventure film. The internecine conflict between apes mirrors the troubled history of our own race.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,75,"Dawn is dynamite entertainment, especially in the rousing first hour."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,75,"An action-packed epic, a moving sci-fi allegory rendered in broad, lush strokes by the latest state of the computer animator’s art."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,75,"This is a summer blockbuster contingent on grand bargains, tactical retreats, and a ferocious, inevitable shock-and-awe campaign."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,70,What is missing from the film is wit—the deep wit that comes from playing off species and environments against each other.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,70,"When it gets going, it’s a pretty fine movie."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,70,"""Dawn's"" vision of masses of intelligent apes swarming the screen as masters of all they survey is even more impressive than it was the last time around and reason enough to see the film all by itself."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,67,"Yet for all the heart and soul the actor pours into his role, watching Dawn still feels a bit like seeing massive, expensive wheels spin in place."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,63,"At a certain point in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, you expect Caesar to say, ""Et tu, Koba?"" Maybe a bit obvious, but it would have shown some wit."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,60,"For its few visual and many script flaws, however, director Matt Reeves (“Cloverfield,” “Let Me In”) balances the splashy set pieces with quieter moments (sullen teen Kodi Smit-McPhee gives a copy of Charles Burns’ “Black Hole” to a wise orangutan named after Maurice Evans!) in such a way that “Dawn” never feels dull or draggy."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,50,"If you see the movie, notice how the ending is no ending, and the fact that it even feels like one is entirely a function of Michael Giacchino's musical score."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,50,"Watching an army of apes riding horses heading into battle is undeniably cool, but that’s the only thing the movie gives you: Neat eye candy. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is written at a level so low, even 8- year-olds will find it lacking."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,40,"Any film that begins with one of those fake-news montages, where snippets of genuine CNN footage are stitched together to concoct a feeling of semi-urgency around its hackneyed apocalypse, already sucks even before it gets started."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,83,"The big battle in Thor: The Dark World is one of Marvel’s more genuinely rousing sequences. Once this movie gets warmed up, it’s warm through and through."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,80,"Marvel’s man with the mallet does all that’s required of him in a breakneck sequel that’s never dark for long. Next time, though, we’ll have more Loki and fewer elves."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,80,"For a movie that has dark in its title, and which is — yes! — darker (people die, Asgard is grimier, as befitting Alan Taylor’s Game Of Thrones heritage), Thor 2.0 is consistently amusing."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,75,"Superhero movies aren't going anywhere, nor is their standard, on-to-the-next-fight structure, so it's heartening to see a gem that grandly and amusingly fills in the blanks."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,75,"Like Whedon's whip-smart ""Avengers"" screenplay, Thor: The Dark World manages to acknowledge the inherently silly nature of its premise while compellingly asserting that, hey, sometimes it's fun to suspend your disbelief when the results look this good."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,70,"The lack of chemistry between Hemsworth and Portman, plain enough in the first Thor movie, is still a problem here, but at least they've largely ditched the starry-eyed schoolgirl routine."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,70,It’s a highly capable sequel that drinks long and deep from the established Marvel legendarium and brings back all the key players from Kenneth Branagh’s 2011 hit “Thor.”
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,70,"It looks like no other movie, Marvel or otherwise, and it’s populated by characters compelling enough to support a more complex, richer story than this one."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,70,"Thor: The Dark World gets a lot more entertaining in the second hour, when the shape-shifting Loki is sprung from his cell (for complicated reasons) and immediately begins trading bitchy insults with his forthright, manly brother."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,70,"This robust, impersonal visual-effects showpiece proves buoyant and unpretentious enough to offset its stew of otherwise derivative fantasy/action elements."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,67,"Forget the fairy-tale romance between Jane and her hammer-wielding hunk. The real emotional center of the Thor series is this sibling rivalry, more compelling than any climactic battle royale or winking teaser for the next chapter."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,67,"After the recent rash of superhero end-spectacles as long-winded and self-serious as a term paper, the limited ambition of The Dark World’s climax is a relief. It scuttles all term paper aspirations and instead humbly lobs a thesis statement-slash-open invitation: Let’s have some fun, shall we? And so we did."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,67,"Hiddleston, with pleading eyes and a mad-dog grin, plays Loki as a wounded sociopath who's cackling at the world but seething on the inside. Which makes you realize he's just about the only character in the movie who has an inside."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"The movie is pretty to look at in a ""Transformers"" sort of way and moves briskly enough that it never threatens to bore, but it's hard to feel much of anything about the characters and, when it's all over, there's a sense that everything that happens is obligatory."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"One of the problems with The Dark World is that its monsters and angry armies and visual effects are interchangeable with Peter Jackson's Tolkien pics, with Clash of the Titans, with The Avengers, with Man of Steel, and on and on.
These superhero movies. These Middle Earth movies. These mythic god movies. It's getting hard to tell them apart."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"Thor: The Dark World's characters are often very charming, but they're only so much fun when they're stuck going through the motions."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"A good model of how superheroes can save the world without forced gravitas, and have fun doing it."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"Compared to other Marvel characters, Thor is a difficult sell."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"This Thor sequel is way funnier than any movie subtitled The Dark World has a right to be (thanks, Hiddleston). And the blowout climax pitting Thor against Malekith and the elves is excitingly staged. It's just that waiting for the good stuff can be a real mood-killer."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"So how's this ""Thor"" sequel? It's fairly entertaining. Same old threats of galaxy annihilation, spiced with fish-out-of-water jokes."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"At times Thor: The Dark World does fire on all cylinders, with fine work from the returning cast, a handful of hilarious sight gags and some cool action sequences. But it’s also more than a little bit silly and quite ponderous and overly reliant on special effects that are more confusing than exhilarating."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"The design is brighter and sharper, the jokes are broader and the villainy utterly generic in this by-the-(comic)-book adaptation."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,60,"There’s nothing in Thor: The Dark World that wasn’t done better in “Thor,” or a lot better in “The Avengers.” Except Tom Hiddleston’s performance as Loki."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,60,"Thor: The Dark World may not be thunder from the movie gods, but it is — shock! — an entertaining journey into mystery, action and fun."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,60,"This is a deeply silly, extremely noisy and sometimes impenetrable action movie that’s drowning in CGI, wild overacting and mullets. And it’s enormously entertaining."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,60,No amount of tool-wielding heroism can save The Dark World from being a startlingly unbalanced movie.
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,58,"My favorite moment in the movie: Astrophysicist Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) insisting on wearing only his underwear because he says he thinks better that way. Hey, whatever works."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,52,"If only all of Thor: The Dark World could capture the magic of its last act, the film wouldn’t feel like such a chink in Marvel’s otherwise solid armor."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,50,"Bigger is not always better. Thor: The Dark World pumps up the action and special effects and loses some of the human element that made the original ""Thor"" something charming and unexpected. True, this sequel gets better as it goes along, but that's a very steep climb just to arrive at not bad."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,50,"Poor Thor. Dude can't even hold center stage in his own movie. He's the Asgardian god of stolen thunder, upstaged at each ab turn by Loki, malarkey and Odin's eyepatch."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,50,Has its moments of visual invention and self-aware humor — mostly when the hero’s trickster brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is around — but otherwise it’s an awkwardly plotted extravaganza.
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,50,"Leaden, non-involving and filled with mind-numbing computer-generated effects."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,50,There’s a fleet and funny comic-book movie nestled inside Thor: The Dark World. You catch glimpses of it here and there.
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,50,"Hiddleston steals the show here, making wickedness and treachery look a heck of a lot more fun than virtue."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,50,"Although director Alan Taylor manages to get things going properly for the final battle in London, the long stretches before that on Asgard and the other branches of Yggdrasil are a drag."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,50,"A film that is enjoyable in spots, but haphazard and ultimately unsatisfying."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,40,"None of that is to say that Thor: The Dark World is a bad movie, necessarily. I would never speak ill of a man with a giant, magical hammer. At the same time, hammer or no hammer, it doesn't quite nail it, either."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,40,"The clutter makes your head feel like it's about to explode - and not in a good way, with wonders upon wonders. Instead it seems like arcana that might show up on the midterm final: the next Marvel movie."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,40,"This is a superhero movie that feels like it might have been made by anyone and no one at the same time, simply space-filler before the next big team-up movie."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,40,"Lacking Iron Man’s wit, the Hulk’s brains, and the Captain’s ideals, he’s in peril of going poof himself if the franchise doesn’t figure out how to capitalize on its most glorious hero."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,40,"It feels entirely made by committee – the definition of house style, without a personal stamp in sight."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,38,"""Dark World” is low-stakes, low-emotion, lowbrow."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,30,The battle scenes are as lacking in heat and coherence as the central love story.
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,30,"The larger problem, transcending all realms, is that this action-adventure sequel from Marvel soon turns so dumb and 3-D-murky that it hurts."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,91,"The most consistently funny studio sequel in some time, and the rare blockbuster that actually delivers on what it promises."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,88,"It's all fab, baby, a kicky, wiggy sequel that scores on all levels, from the sexy to the sublime."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,80,"Give your brain the night off, and Myers will make you smile too."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,80,"As a character, Austin Powers hasn't worn out his welcome, exactly, but he has outlived his novelty."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,80,Places Myers firmly on the top rung of movie comics.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,78,"A collection of arbitrary sketches, bits and improvs jammed into a locker room-style variety show masquerading as some semblance of a narrative."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,75,"Given the choice between a movie that's better structured and only half as funny, I'd take The Spy Who Shagged Me (or its predecessor, for that matter) any day."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,75,"With its outrageous double-entendre, gonzo performances and appalling lack of restraint, the sequel is more than a guilty pleasure."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,75,"Better than anyone dared hope: bigger, more inventive, and more frolicsome than its predecessor, with a grab bag of scatological gags that are almost as riotous when you think back on them."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,75,"There's a rampant looseness to this movie, and it's subversively liberating."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,Turns out to be less than the sum of its wonderfully silly and bizarre parts.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,"For my taste, too much of the new Powers looks like bad TV and sounds like old burlesque."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,There is an underlying likability to Austin Powers that sort of carries us through the movie.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,"If it all seems a bit dizzying, it is, but there's plenty to enjoy."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,"The repulsive turn of events erased all my good memories of the first half, and makes the movie hard to recommend to a normal human being."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,"Too much of what The Spy Who Shagged Me has to offer is tired and derivative, and, when the various jokes and gags are tallied, there are many more misses than hits."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,63,A movie that's nearly as good as its publicity campaign.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,63,"At this point, the effect of Myers' one-man Sixties love-in already feels less shagadelic than just shagged out."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,63,Script just doesnt have it in terms of fresh narrative developments or individual gags.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,63,"After a while it becomes apparent that this movie is too eager to please, too willing to sacrifice its point of view toward its targets to sustain itself for the length of a feature."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,60,Several love beads short of its predecessor.  Intermittently hilarious comedy.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,60,"The satire is crammed with sexual and scatological humor; some may find this Rabelaisian and refreshing, while others will detect the end of civilization as we know it."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,50,Would be too long even if it were twice as funny. And that about sums up the movie.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,50,Kills whatever charm the first movie had by recycling its few serviceable parts.
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,100,"A great movie... A pop epiphany, marking that commercially creative point where the power of Hollywood meets the purity of myth."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,100,"Because it is a sequel, it's less satisfying than the more idea-driven original, but this is still top-flight kick-ass entertainment"
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,100,"Cameron's achievement isn't only technical. He's using all the not-so-cheap thrills of a violent genre to make a movie with an antiviolence message, and the wonder of T2 is that he pulls it off without looking silly."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,100,"The key element in any action picture, I think, is a good villain. Terminator 2 has one, along with an intriguing hero and fierce heroine, and a young boy who is played by Furlong with guts and energy."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,90,"T2 features bigger, bolder, more energetic action sequences than its predecessor."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,88,The movie is a great big feast of wreckage. But that’s also what makes it a bit numbing.
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,88,"As with ""Aliens,"" director James Cameron has again taken a first rate science fiction film and crafted a sequel that's in some ways more impressive - expanding on the original rather than merely remaking it."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,83,"Visceral to the point of overkill (and beyond), a berserk blizzard of kinetic images, it doesn't even give you time to be scared."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,80,"The action in Terminator 2 is edited for maximum suspense, and much of it is mounted on such a grand scale that little in movie history comes close. (Scenes in last summer's Die Hard 2 did, but they lacked the finesse of the new film)."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,80,"The film's relentless pummeling grows wearying at 135 minutes. The first Terminator, a half-hour shorter, was leaner and meaner."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,80,It's a joyride until you think about the film's biggest contradiction. How come this movie celebrating the superiority of human feelings over machine precision is most alive when thrilling in the mechanical perfection of the Terminator and T-1000? Inside Terminator 2 beats a human heart. But its soul is that of a killer machine.
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,75,Trend-setting visuals compensate for a plot that lacks the imagination and edge of the 1984 original.
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,75,"Mr. Cameron has made a swift, exciting special-effects epic that thoroughly justifies its vast expense and greatly improves upon the first film's potent but rudimentary visual style. He has also broadened his initial idea to encompass better developed characters (after all, the first Terminator was barely verbal), a livelier wit and a more ambitious, if nuttier, message."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,75,"What is notable, though, is the amount of compassion invested in the film by Cameron and co-screenwriter William Wisher. There's a fairly well-drawn moral message in T2 that was more or less absent in the first film."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,75,"All the virtues of the original... are present here, though when Cameron tries to milk some sentiment out of the ""personality"" and fate of his top machine he comes up flat and empty, and the other characters are scarcely more interesting."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,70,"If you change the course of history, the world will experience a different kind of chaos. That's a time-honored movie cliche. Terminator 2: Judgment Day chooses to go against that philosophy, noisily and with some monotony."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,83,"There is still Spider-Man's personal turmoil, crises of romance and loyalty, that Webb occasionally holds a few beats too long. Yet the performances ring true, with arresting chemistry where it counts."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,80,One heck of a fun film -- and the most enjoyable and rewarding superhero movie I've seen in a while.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,80,"There are two types of superhero movies: the ones that brood and the ones that swing. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is proudly the latter, filled with high-energy action."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,80,Webb's film is bold and bright and possesses charm in abundance. It swings into the future and carries the audience with it.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,76,"An essential entry in the cinematic canon of Spider-Man, complete with new villains, new questions, and new heartaches."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,75,"Overlong and repetitive as it is, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, at least delivers the goods."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,75,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 grows stronger and more engrossing as it unfolds.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,75,"Director Marc Webb and his forces come up with some gorgeous special effects, and Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have terrific chemistry, but as is the case with far too many superhero movies, the plot is a bit of an overstuffed mess."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,75,"Aerial sequences are often thrilling. However, interpersonal relations are front and center in this installment."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,75,"It's a Marvel spectacle that manages to deftly balance razzle-dazzle, feel-it-in-your-gut slingshot moments of flight and believable human relationships. There's psychological weight to go with all of the gravity-defying, webslinging weightlessness."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,75,"It has action sequences that will appeal to people looking for the usual pyrotechnics, but the core of the movie - and the source of the audience's interest - is emotion."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,70,"Honestly, one can only wish that Hollywood made movies for non-teenagers and non-comics fans with this much care and reverence. Are superhero movies dying? Well sure, but you and I and the planet may die first."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,70,"The plot gets itself tangled up in multiple villain strands, but in the main this installment is emotionally weightier and more satisfying than its predecessor."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,70,"Redundancy remains a problem, but this overlong superhero sequel gets by on sound, fury and star chemistry."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,67,"By the end of this film, they've done a very good job of setting up the next three or four films in the series, but at the expense of this film telling any sort of cohesive story."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,63,Less “amazing” than persistent.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,63,"Lacks the origin-story freshness of its predecessor (even if the inaugural Garfield Spider-Man came only five years after the final installment of the Sam Raimi-directed Tobey Maguire Spider-Man trilogy). It lacks a charismatic central character, too."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,63,"Easy to watch but hard to pin down, like a creature with eight legs going in different directions."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,63,"So while this Spider-Man is, if anything, more competent than the first film it’s still not one that demands that you stick around after the credits. There’s nothing there."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,60,The Occasionally Amazing Spider-Man 2 might be a better way to think of the not-always-spectacular but sometimes satisfying Spider-Man sequel.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,60,"Although it fundamentally has many of the same issues as the first film, the strengths are enhanced in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and it's certainly a step forward for the franchise. Now, let's give the web-head a villain worthy of his attention."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,60,"An overlong, at times almost plot-free soap opera that introduces a wealth of characters and dips into a wide variety of subplots but never comes together as a story."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,60,"A few too-broad gags aside — and even these are in the funky spirit of ’60s Marvel — this is a satisfying second issue with thrills, heartbreak, gasps, and a perfectly judged slingshot ending."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,60,"Bright, punchy and earnest, Webb’s affable sequel is tough to dislike despite its tonal whiplash and clumsy script, which is redeemed by Garfield, Stone and DeHaan’s powerhouse trio."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,60,"Marc Webb, returning after the last instalment, again shows a better feel for the relationships than he does for juggling all the overlapping story elements."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,58,"Even at a hefty 142 minutes, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 hasn’t the time for its surfeit of plot, nor for the sprawling ensemble of supporting characters caught in the sticky web Webb weaves."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"Bloated and often boring and has absolutely no reason to exist, but that it also hits its marks. No fanboy will pass it up. No studio head will lose his or her job."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"It’s sufficiently giddy at first but eventually grows repetitive and wearying, especially as more and more stuff gets blown up real good."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"Despite all the swooping and spinning and swinging in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Garfield looks less like a kid having fun than like an actor entangled in a corporate web that, at least for now, he can’t escape."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"Things go wrong quickly with Amazing 2. Am I the only one who hates the word Amazing to describe a movie that isn't? Just asking. If I had to pinpoint where this epic goes south, I'd start with the tonal shifts."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"A sequel that, until a late, lamentably foolish turn, balances blockbuster bombast with human-scale drama, child-friendly comedy and gushers of tears."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"It takes something lackluster like The Amazing Spider-Man 2 to remind viewers why movies like ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" are considered superior."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"Although handsomely mounted, this latest star in the Marvel Universe is not a leading light. But it probably has enough juice to keep the galaxy spinning until something more original comes along and knocks it out of orbit."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"I'm still not convinced we needed a new Spider-Man series, but at least this installment is interestingly mediocre instead of actively bad."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"Folks, I confess: I'm coping with a mild case of arachno-apatha-phobia, defined as the fear of another so-so ""Spider-Man"" sequel."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"There are too many explosions, too many blaring sonic effects, too many break-ups-and-make-ups, too many villains. And not enough heart."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"It is not a sequel, just another retread of tired material in a franchise that is more than ready for the big comic book bonfire. And why the title? There is nothing amazing about it."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"The silver lining: Like its predecessor, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 offers its successor another fresh start, since no one will remember what happened in this movie, either."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"The narrative doesn't want for ambition, but Marc Webb proves unwilling, or incapable, of making this unwieldy story feel like anything but a deluge of backstory."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"The Amazing Spider-Man is more like an old Xerox copy: Greasy, paper-thin, slightly faded, and probably made unnecessarily, but in any case destined to get lost in a pile of things exactly like it."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"Never a disaster but only fitfully inspired, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 doesn't quite end well, but it does end promisingly."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,46,"Ultimately, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is noteworthy for one thing—not waiting until the third or fourth film to achieve the overstuffed, increasingly garish look one associates with less popular (2007’s Spider-Man 3) and outright ridiculed (1997’s Batman and Robin) franchise efforts."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,42,"ASM 2 makes too many of the same mistakes that have brought other superhero movies low (including Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 3""). It tries to pack in too many characters and plot lines, for one."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,40,This franchise needs more than a reset. It's ripe for retirement.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,40,"Frantic and rote by turns, mislaying the power of the central love story and piling on the mutant adversaries. For at least this installment, Spider-Man is Amazing no more."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,40,The movie feels not only calculated but tired.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,33,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2, is just good enough to make you painfully aware of all the ways it's not good at all."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,30,"The film, like the original, feels very haphazardly structured, a hotchpotch collection of scenes rather than a unified whole. There's also no tonal consistency, with Webb lurching awkwardly from quippy comedy to brooding drama to high tragedy in short spaces of time, undercutting all three modes as a result."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,25,"The project as a whole conveys a drab sense of bureaucratic necessity, a ""let's get this over with"" wheeziness."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,80,"There's much mumbo-jumbo about past lives and symbolic tattoos, but who cares when you can gaze at a sight as lovely as a dirigible floating in the night sky?"
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,75,"Both pleasantly old-fashioned and packed with up-to-date computer-generated special effects, the film's constant plot turns, cheeky sensibility and omnipresent action sequences have no trouble attracting our attention and holding on."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,70,"Virtually bursts with visual goodies, and writer-director Stephen Sommers scarcely allows the actors, or the audience, a moment to take a breath during the nonstop action of the final hour."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,70,Sommers is a pure pop Steven Spielberg who's put his deft technical skills in the service of the ultimate rollercoaster movie ride. It's sometimes more exhausting than exciting.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,67,So gleefully abandons any semblance of sanity that it's virtually impossible not to enjoy the sheer breadth of nonsensical fun taking place on screen.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,67,"Action junkies may enjoy this non-stop barrage, which barely pauses for anything but the most rudimentary (albeit complicated) plot exposition."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,63,"Perfectly enjoyable swashbuckling, eye-catching entertainment."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,63,"The movie resembles a video game in which each victory whisks you to the next level, with slightly different antagonists and a faster pace."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,63,Mostly he's (Fraser) trapped in a sequel that's too wrapped up in a desire to top itself.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,63,It's all very impressive without being particularly enthralling.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,60,The actors themselves are more rip roaring and full of spunk than in their first outing.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,60,A few billion 1s and 0s in search of a movie.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,58,"The noisome action sequences of The Mummy Returns are preferable to the quiet times, when the cast is limited to spouting dialogue that is a banal combination of exposition and homily."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,It works its gilded butt off to give you your money's worth.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,Suffers from the bloat common to sequels.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,"Everything the first ""Mummy"" was fun for not being. It's loud and chaotic, jammed with effects that don't wow us precisely because they are trying so hard to wow us."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,"The mistake of The Mummy Returns is to abandon the characters, and to use the plot only as a clothesline for special effects and action sequences."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,More emphasis on computer-generated gimmickry than on persuasive acting and ideas.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,First and foremost a trial run for a Universal Studios ride.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,"You can't see the movie for the footage, so thick is it with digital tricks and furious action."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,This might all have been silly fun -- as it was in the 1999 version -- except for the carelessness of the whole picture.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,"Many of the visual effects are stunning, but others are downright cheesy -- especially an attempt to fuse the Rock's head onto a scorpion's body."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,"Fraser is likable enough, albeit never quite convincing as an action hero."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,We have to suffer through two hours of this rancid summer cheese.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,40,"It punishes rather than entertains; it condescends, it offends, it loathes its audience."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,90,"This is a movie of tremendous visual daring, magnificent special-effects work and surprising moral gravity."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,88,The sheer filmmaking craft on display here shames almost any comparably budgeted superhero picture you can name.
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,88,"In form, it's no wham-bam VFX sizzle reel replete with sputtering, ejaculatory climaxes. It's the magnificently sustained equivalent of Ravel's ""Bolero,"" with nuclear warheads in place of timpani rolls."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,88,"The director thinks visually, which sounds redundant until you realize how many monster movies are flat, effects-dependent factory jobs. Edwards knows how to use great heights for great effect."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,83,"The worry regarding 2014's Godzilla was that it would seem like a retread of recent big-budget monster mashes ""Cloverfield"" or ""Pacific Rim,"" or, worse yet, that it would sink to the depths of the 1998 American reboot. Happily, though, this one can stand on its own two enormous three-toed feet."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,83,"This Godzilla doesn’t tap into deeper cultural anxieties the way its 60-year-old ancestor did. Nor does it engender much dramatic investment in its hero... Yet as pure popcorn entertainment, Godzilla delivers plenty of goosebumps."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,83,"This could easily be ground zero for a whole new series of films, but if it remains a stand-alone single movie, Edwards told an entire story, and for the first time in as long as I can remember, it feels like Godzilla actually matters."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,80,"That rare breed of blockbuster that emphasises character over spectacle and slow-burn tension over relentless action sequences, Godzilla rewards patience with strong performances and sparing, spine-tingling set-pieces."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,80,"The human drama isn't always as compelling as it wants to be, but at its best Godzilla is a hugely entertaining blockbuster that starts strongly and finishes with a mighty roar. The king of the monsters has returned, and it appears he's here to stay."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,80,"A summer blockbuster that’s not just thrilling, but that orchestrates its thrills with such rare diligence, you want to yelp with glee."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,75,Godzilla 2014 is a more somber and frightening reboot than the cartoonish 1998 movie.
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,75,"The second half of Godzilla is definitely more fun than the first part of a film I enjoyed overall, if less than last year’s similar dip into giant monster blockbusterdom, “Pacific Rim.”"
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,75,"Here, finally, is a giant monster movie made in the anything-goes CGI era still capable of making your jaw drop."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,75,"While it has its moments of baffling plot development and the human characters aren’t exactly Shakespearean in depth, there’s some pretty impressive CGI monster destruction here, and the talented English director Gareth Edwards clearly respects the thought-provoking sci-fi roots of the original."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,75,"In many ways, Godzilla is a cousin to Edwards' earlier movie, ""Monsters,"" in that it focuses more on the ineffectual humans than the monsters."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,75,"Edwards manages to sustain a grim, cerebral atmosphere all the way through, as if fighting the inevitable demands of the material. The movie contains enough basic money shots to please hardcore Godzilla fans without indulging in them at every opportunity. By contemporary blockbusters standards, it's practically a minimalist enterprise."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,70,"You don’t go see a 2014 Godzilla reboot for the delicate character shadings and plausible story structure. You go to watch a giant radioactive lizard whale on stuff, and on that score, Godzilla does its work."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,70,"Edwards’ film doesn’t care much about metaphorical resonance, and cares even less about its human characters, many of which get forgotten for long stretches of the film. But Godzilla has a way with a disaster setpiece, and it cares a lot about providing awesome monster-on-monster action on a mammoth scale."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,70,"Superbly made but burdened by some dull human characters enacted by an interesting international cast who can't do much with them, this new Godzilla is smart, self-aware, eye-popping and arguably in need of a double shot of cheeky wit."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,67,"It’s just a popcorn movie – but it’s loud, smashing fun, if you accept it as a high-tech piece of silliness."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,67,It’s a creature feature for the Subatomic Age.
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,67,He doesn't seem too interested in his actors — they're more plodding than their reptilian costars and you don't care about a single one of them — but Edwards does know how to fashion some serious monster mayhem.
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,65,"We're here to see the film's leading lizard, who is pretty gorgeously realized by an army of digitizers, even if he seems just a bit-player in his own movie for the first hour or so."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,63,"An uneven spectacle that can’t sustain its solid first-half character moments. But the movie can also flash a surprising, often clever sense of legacy, and is intermittently capable of thrilling us."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,63,"Fortunately, the monsters are actually kind of a kick. And isn’t that why you go to see a movie like this anyway?"
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,63,"Seeing the scaly dude side with Mother Nature against the freaks is almost worth enduring the blather that precedes it. I said ""almost."""
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,60,"Ironically this big, lumbering movie could have used more, not less. More Godzilla without question, and more emotional content for its very good cast too."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,60,"It is at once bloated and efficient, executed with tremendous discipline and intelligence and conceived with not too much of either."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,60,"How many times have we complained that summer blockbusters are all about the action, at the expense of niceties like character development? Well, Edwards has gone in another direction, one that's more intriguing in theory than on the screen."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,60,"Edwards’ film boasts great filmmaking, noble intentions and cracking monster action. Yet it never reconciles its B-movie origins — preposterous premise, clichéd characters — with its solemn, Nolanised tone. This Godzilla stomps but very rarely romps."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,60,"It’s always fun to watch scaly, skyscraper-size behemoths lay waste to civilization, but a bit more human drama wouldn’t have gone amiss."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,60,Edwards seems to have miscalculated our investment in his cast...simultaneously underestimating how satisfying some good old-fashioned monster-on-MUTO action can be.
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,60,"The best thing about this new Godzilla is that it spares no expense or effort to deliver big, burly IMAX-ified action... The worst thing about this new Godzilla is how that’s the best thing about it."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,58,"Sometimes, oftentimes, trailers showcase only the good stuff. The actual movie is a pale substitute. Such is the case here."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,58,"Godzilla asks you to care about its characters, achieves that aspiration, earns your trust, and then not only pivots towards a far less interesting character, but abandons most of its absorbing emotional legwork for a fairly rote and straightforward rock ‘em, sock ‘em monster movie."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,55,"Director Gareth Edwards (“Monsters”) gets the money shots right, but neither he nor screenwriter Max Borenstein (working from a story by David Callaham) makes the human characters interesting enough to get us through two mostly Godzilla-free acts."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,Skip Godzilla the movie. Watch the trailer.
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,"Godzilla – both the movie and the big guy – is otherwise something of a lumpy, lumbering great beast of a thing, lurching from city to city, continent to continent, smackdown to smackdown and plot point to plot point with singularly graceless indifference to anything other than those take-home jaw-dropper shots."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,"When the film finally gets around to monsters on a rampage, you'll get both more and less than you bargained for."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,"The problem is that he — unlike most modern sci-fi directors, who throw so much CGI at you that they make miracles cheap — seems peculiarly stingy when it’s time to deliver."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,"What's particularly weird about Godzilla is that for long stretches, all it shows is destruction."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,The latest Hollywood version of the Godzilla story is neither fun nor fearsome. It’s an empty spectacle in which the humans are as meaningless as the monster.
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,At some juncture — much earlier than director Gareth Edwards intends — Godzilla needs to stop being an extra in his own movie.
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,"Godzilla is one of those generic, omnipresent blockbusters that's undone by the very spectacle it strives to dazzle us with: Everything is so gargantuan, so momentous, that nothing has any weight."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,"In a tale this timeworn and a film this devoid of humor, with only a few moments of humanity, with tension frittered away by the tedious repetition of the fights, anybody who has ever seen Godzilla in any incarnation can be forgiven for asking the obvious. “What else have you got?”"
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,40,"Despite a few fiery breaths, there’s mostly hot air from a lot of serious actors slumming it."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,40,"While many people might want to go to the cinema to see Godzilla, what they get instead is a load of homosapiens desperately trying to put a human face on the drama."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,30,"Edwards’ Godzilla dawdles toward its Doomsday climax; the movie could win a prize for Least Stuff Happening in the First Two-Thirds of an Action Film... It’s a concept lacking a magnetic story, a package without a product."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,100,The best Hollywood movies always knew how to sneak a beguiling subtext into a crowd-pleasing story. Superman Returns is in that grand tradition. That's why it's beyond Super. It's superb.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,100,"America's favorite superhero reappears in Bryan Singer's Superman Returns, and all we can say is, ""Man, oh Man of Steel, it's good to have you back."""
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,100,"Superman Returns is a lush and enthralling piece of adventure storytelling that's both revisionist AND reverential, putting a timely spin on a timeless character without violating his primal appeal."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,100,It’s all about heart - not that the spectacle falters; this is the finest popular entertainment since the Rings trilogy closed. Superman doesn’t fly - he soars.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,91,"The film is magnificently mounted, it moves like a speeding bullet and it's so respectful of Superman traditions that even the pickiest of die-hard fans should love it. After a lapse of two decades, it revitalizes the franchise and makes it seem fresh and alive."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,90,Grandly conceived and sensitively drawn.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,90,"This Superman, which infuses its action with poetry, soars as a love story filled with epic yearnings, thwarted desires and breathtaking imagery."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,90,"Superman, born in 1938, is still very much alive in 2006. The Man of Steel has so skillfully bent the bars of our imagination that he seems real to us. And in a sense, he is."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,88,Superman Returns is not only a credit to the first two Superman movies; it may be the best of the series. Its combination of romance and fantasy adventure is unparalleled in superhero comic book-to-movie sagas.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,88,A spectacularly satisfying reworking of the legend of Kal-El.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,88,"Bryan Singer's super, soulful and very expensive new resurrection of the venerable big-screen franchise, ups the ante with must-see results."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,80,"Director Bryan Singer positions this new film as a sequel to Donner's film, and his Superman -- played with winning fortitude by newcomer Brandon Routh -- is less a Man of Steel than a Man of Heart."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,80,"The movie may not be a single-bound building-leaper but Bryan Singer reconfigures the daddy of all comic-book sagas into something knowing, witty, and even sensitive."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,80,"The surprise of Superman Returns is that it isn't a funky, ambitious conceptual reimagining, like last summer's ""Batman Begins."" This really IS your father's Superman; it re-creates - and updates, though just barely - the universe Donner invented."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,"Superman returns with a bang. Singer tarnishes his hero's halo with just enough sexual longing and self-doubt to make him riveting and relatable. That ""S"" on his suit has a whole new meaning: He's a Soul man."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,"The film has such an expansive, likeable spirit."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,A generally thrilling entertainment that's not quite the grand slam you want it to be.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,"This Superman is like nothing you've ever seen before, but it tickles something primitive and comforting at the back of the mind. Gorgeously detailed and meticulously realized, it's a homecoming of a movie. Just wait for the theme; you'll understand."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,A rousing spectacle.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,"The new Superman has its visionary charms, but there's only so far you can go without great characters."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,"Singer's reverence for the 1978 version edges perilously close to mimicry, as if he has no new ideas to bring to the table, but he succeeds in drawing out the Superman myth with simple power and a refreshing absence of irony."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,"By giving the hero's inner plight so many dimensions, Superman Returns brings a richer, grander perspective to a seminal character without changing his essence. It's a profoundly personal take on a universal icon, made by a filmmaker who continues to improve with each movie."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,"Superman returns, and he's far from inconsequential yet considerably less than super - just a demi-god content to forfeit our love for our like."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,"The much ballyhooed movie, far from great and far from short (2 1/2 hours!), is still great fun."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,70,"The fanboy in me loves it, being wrapped in the warm projected glow of nostalgia for a movie I've memorized since age 9."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,70,"Yes, this Superman soars, but he doesn't always take us with him."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,67,Superman Returns has everything going for it except surprise.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,63,"Don't hate him because he's beautiful, decent, awesomely powerful, modest and just plain good. That's the big blue Boy Scout package - take it or leave it."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,63,"Star Routh's presence and the joys of flight keep Superman Returns alive, but all those missteps dog its heels, holding it back like little touches of Kryptonite in the night."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,60,"The film's most striking repeated effect, in which the caped hero dangles dejectedly in space as the Earth turns below him, emphasizes the passivity and loneliness of the character: This Superman's version of flight seems almost indistinguishable from a helpless freefall. Fair enough, but what's he got to be so existentially glum about?"
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,60,"Singer draws heavily on the 1978 hit that launched the Warner Brothers franchise, with Brandon Routh dully impersonating Christopher Reeve as the Man of Steel, Kevin Spacey getting all the good lines as the villainous Lex Luthor, and stock footage of Marlon Brando proving that death isn't always a good career move."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,60,"Contains a dozen winning moments of humor, uplift or exhilaration. But are they enough to justify a 154-minute running time?"
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,58,"A dull, uninspiring film that combines pedestrian acting, lackluster special effects and deadly pace with a pseudo-religious theme."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,58,"Picture my disappointment as I realized that, for all the pizzazz of Superman Returns, its global weapon of choice would not be terrorism, or nuclear piracy, or dirty bombs. It would be real estate. What does Warner Bros. have in mind for the next installment? Superman overhauls corporate pension plans? Luthor screws Medicare?"
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,50,"When the hero, his alter ego, his girlfriend and the villain all seem to lack any joy in being themselves, why should we feel joy at watching them?"
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,50,"The movie consistently delivers in lots of little ways, but in a big way only once, in a spectacular sequence that begins with a series of earthquakes and culminates in an airline catastrophe."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,50,It's hard to see what the point is beyond the usual grandiosity that comes whenever B-movie material is pumped up with ambition and money.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,50,"I wanted to like Superman Returns, but Singer and company are so concerned about doing justice to Superman’s past, they fail to generate much interest in what, if any, future the franchise might have."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,50,"The bigger problem is that Singer’s weighty rhythms are disastrous for Superman, and the movie actually gets heavier in its last half-hour."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,100,"One of the great satisfactions of Spectre is that, in addition to all the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organization out to steal everyone’s personal information, we get to believe in Bond as a person."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,100,It’s a feat of pure cinematic necromancy.
Spectre,6.8,200074175,100,"It’s deeply silly but uproariously entertaining. At the end, I almost felt guilty for enjoying it all quite so much - almost."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,88,"Craig puts heat and heart into Spectre, as if he's taken Bond as far he can. The movie is a fever dream of all the Bond villains and all of Bond's efforts to see a life past them."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,80,"This sophisticated sugar rush is the longest Bond film ever, but it cruises by with an elegant sense of danger. As with all of Daniel Craig’s 007 outings, it amps up the intelligence and tamps down the attitude."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,80,"Craig is cruelly efficient. Dave Bautista makes a good, Oddjob-like assassin. And while Lea Seydoux doesn’t leave a huge impression as this film’s “Bond girl,” perhaps it’s because we’ve already met — far too briefly — the hypnotic Monica Bellucci, as the first real “Bond woman” since Diana Rigg."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,80,"Though not as dramatically rich or emotionally compelling as Skyfall, Spectre still ranks as a sleek, pulse-pounding if slightly overlong entertainment."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,80,"Even if this is less satisfying overall than Skyfall, there are sequences that rank with Bond’s best."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,75,"A Bond movie is all about delivering on expectations: to enjoy it you have to be pleased rather than frustrated by its predictability. In that regard, Spectre, Daniel Craig’s fourth outing as Bond and the second directed by Sam Mendes, can be deemed a solid success: not as darkly stylish as ""Skyfall"" but not as stupidly grim as ""Quantum of Solace"" either."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,75,"Spectre is the most “traditional” of the Craig Bonds. Although a little light on gadgets, it has everything else,"
Spectre,6.8,200074175,75,"It's business as usual, even if that business is pulled off with brilliant precision, ingeniously choreographed action, and an itinerary boasting some of the most photogenic spots on Earth."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,75,Spectre isn’t bad — just slightly disappointing.
Spectre,6.8,200074175,75,"This is the 24th Bond film and it ranks solidly in the middle of the all-time rankings, which means it’s still a slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain who is clearly out of his mind but seems to like it that way."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,75,"For all its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters, “Spectre” works best when everyone’s on the ground, doing his or her job, driving expensive fast cars heedlessly, detonating the occasional wisecrack, enjoying themselves and their beautiful clothes."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,70,"Anyone who has tamped down that youthful yen for excitement should stay away. But the craving for grownup glamour, however foolish, demands equal satisfaction, and Spectre, in providing it, acquires a throb of mystery that cannot be explained by mere plot."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,70,"The new James Bond movie Spectre makes a satisfying final chapter to the four-film saga of Daniel Craig’s 007, even if that saga turns out to be less than the sum of its parts."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,70,It remains a decently robust and entertaining midlevel Bond movie — just one that's haunted by the specter of its predecessor.
Spectre,6.8,200074175,70,"Spectre is still fun, the cast is top-flight. And had it been the first Bond film with Craig in the title role, the reaction likely would be ""wow!"" This is some good stuff, way deeper than the silly Bonds. But with history behind us, it feels a little slight."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,70,"In the end, Spectre is just too much of a good thing. Though each scene is carefully wrought, there's little grace, majesty, or romance in the way the pieces are connected. The whole is bumpy and inelegant — entertaining for sure, but hard to love."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,70,"What’s missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of “Skyfall,” as the film sustains its predecessor’s nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,70,"Bond has seen it all before, this team has done it all before, and the production juggernaut hits every beat with a carefully calibrated precision which can be deeply satisfying but also risk coming across as rote."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,67,"Not bad, no need to wake Roger Moore from his mid-morning nap and bring him out of retirement, but not special."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,67,"It’s possible that Skyfall created expectations that were too high for Spectre to match. But with all he’s done for the franchise, Craig deserves to go out with a bigger, smarter bang."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,67,"What Spectre lacks is the sinister magnetic pull of Skyfall, a Bond movie with real stakes and attitude and distinctive flavor, not to mention more mesmeric images than one can usually expect from this workmanlike blockbuster franchise."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,65,Spectre is a frustratingly unsatisfying experience.
Spectre,6.8,200074175,63,"The clichéd ghosts of James Bond past haunt Spectre, an action adventure whose biggest failure is looking back on 007’s own success."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,63,"All of its revisionism centrally incorporates the history of the franchise, and the film both excels and suffers for frequently recalling its forbears."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,63,"It's filled with big sets, big stunts, and what ought to be big moments, but few of them land."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,60,"If Spectre has any saving grace, it’s Craig, who remains the best non-Connery Bond. It is not merely his physical presence, which is formidable enough; he has a unique ability to make peevishness dramatically compelling. And the subtlety of his sense of humor is one of the better aspects of his 007."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,60,"Granted, there's comfort to be found in the familiarity of Mendes' film, which makes an effort to look back while also advancing the series. But there's a fine line between paying homage to the past and merely repeating it.... Spectre often crosses that line."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,60,"The first act is great, full of dark portent and bravura film-making flourishes. However, the final hour disappoints, with too many off-the-peg plot twists and too many characters conforming to type."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,60,"An unbalanced but never less than entertaining film, enthralling and deflating in roughly equal measure, and studded with moments of true, old-school glory."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,58,"Even a subpar James Bond movie is worth seeing because, well, it’s James Bond. But if one of the most successful and long-running franchises in movie history wants to keep pumping, it’s once again time to change the formula."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,50,"Despite a plot trajectory that changes so often they seem to be making it up as they go along, everyone on and off the screen seems to be doing it by the numbers."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,50,"There’s nothing surprising in Spectre, the 24th “official” title in the series, which is presumably as planned. Much as the perfect is the enemy of good, originality is often the enemy of the global box office."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,50,"Familiarity is not without its pleasures. But Spectre is so confused and inert that Craig can’t even sell the signature “Bond. James Bond” and “Shaken, not stirred” lines."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,50,"Spectre, set up to be the Daniel Craig finale as Bond, isn’t a terrible installment in the franchise. It’s the lightest of the Craig Bonds — no sin in that. But like the end of Connery, the exit of Roger Moore and the layoff notice given Pierce Brosnan, it’s a tired, trite “greatest hits” re-packaging of stunts, chases and fights from earlier, better Bonds."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,50,"I know the opening credits for a James Bond movie are supposed to be silly, but the start of Spectre achieves almost orgasmic levels of kitsch."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,50,"A drab, anemic machine, Spectre, may bring the spectacle, but it lacks a soul. Someone get Idris Elba on the phone."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,42,"Watching Spectre unfold, lumbering and slumbering, on the heels of a franchise high is a shock, so much talent coasting this time."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,42,"They have tried, with this Daniel Craig run of films, to elevate the Bond movies so they are more than just acceptably silly spy movies, and one of the reasons SPECTRE is so frustrating is because it feels like the collapse of that ambition, and it is in one moment that you can see the entire thing burn to the ground."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,42,"In general, this feels like a film patched together out of endless hastily-drafted script rewrites rather than a cohesive vision."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,40,"Yes, some of the individual stunts and action set pieces temporarily hold our interest...but the story itself is not convincing on its own terms, playing like a series of boxes (Bond asking for a martini shaken not stirred) that need to be checked off and forgotten."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,40,"Like Skyfall, Spectre is loaded with allusions to the previous films in the franchise, undoubtedly providing much glee for Bond fans. The nods, quips, and general formula that audiences have come to know soon becomes weary and tiring, however."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,38,"“A license to kill is also a license to not kill,” M lectures his new boss in the 24th James Bond film, Spectre. Well, it’s not a license to bore as much as this bloated drag manages to do."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,38,"At the center of the film, like a man trying to pull a donkey out of a peat bog, stands Craig: inexpressive, uninflected and obviously tired. Perhaps he’s trying to play a chap who never allows himself access to his emotions, for fear loved ones may be snatched away, but he just looks like an actor who wishes he could quit his job."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,37,"We don’t expect a James Bond film to be deep, but at least we should be dazzled by the seductive gloss of its surfaces. Aside from that stunning opening sequence, this installment feels overcompensating and dutiful."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,30,"Perhaps some of the goofiness was intentional — you can’t always tell from this production’s wavering tone — but Spectre is full of not-good things, and some oppressively bad things that may come to feel like drill bits twirling in your skull."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,100,"The film's immense cast and crew, headed by director Michael Bay, writer Randall Wallace and stars Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, blend artistry and technology to create a blockbuster entertainment that has passion, valor and tremendous action."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,75,It expertly capitalizes on the emotional associations Americans have with Pearl Harbor and renders the battle scenes with an excellence that goes beyond proficiency and into the realm of art.
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,75,"The cast is engaging, the overall visual effects are tremendous and I found myself fairly swept away for most of the fast-moving, three-hour running time."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,75,"Until a disappointing tailspin in the last hour, Pearl Harbor is the best piece of popular entertainment to come along in years."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,70,"Ninety minutes into this massive movie the attack commences, and the spectacular images come hurtling like fireballs. This is, let's be honest, what we're here for, and what most Jerry Bruckheimer-produced movies serve up best: the poetry of destruction."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,70,Parts of this three-hour World War II epic are brilliant -- especially the 40-minute sequence in which the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor is stunningly re-created.
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,70,"The picture is nearly painstaking in its traditionalism, a tale of love, war, and valor in which nostalgia for ''simpler times'' gets mashed together, almost fetishistically, with nostalgia for old movies and for the spirit of knightly self sacrifice during World War II."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,67,A movie meant to explode off the screen -- and it's at its best when those explosions are going full blast.
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,63,"It's war porn, a movie that revels in the carnage."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,60,"Works best as a bang-and- boom action picture, a loud symphony of bombardment and explosion juiced up with frantic editing and shiny computer-generated imagery."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,60,"It's a Ritalin-deprived sensibility, but it keeps you skating over the dull spots, in which the film unfortunately is rich."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"A crowd-pleasing blockbuster if ever there was one, features as its centerpiece a jaw-droppingly vivid re-creation of the Japanese attack on the U.S.'s fabled (and extremely vulnerable, as it turned out) Pacific fleet."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"""Pearl Harbor"" is exactly the kind of prestige project you'd expect from a director like Bay, hitting all its targets with plodding precision and never once achieving surprise."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"Clearly, neither screenwriter Randall Wallace nor director Michael Bay ever met a cliche he didn't embrace."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"For all its agonizing true-life trappings, has the staying power of a grand-scale video game. Manhattan's sushi bars are in no danger of going dark."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,The filmmakers would have been better advised to stick with the Zeroes and spend less time making up heroes.
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"The 2,400 Americans who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor deserve a nobler memorial than this sentimental hogwash that reduces heroism to ""Top Gun"" antics and pretty cinematography."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"Unfortunately, the bulk of the three-hour epic is third-rate schmaltz that pays only lip service to history."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,It's an extravaganza worth seeing once -- and maybe later on DVD.
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"If you decide to hit the concessions stand (where you're bound to have lots of company), I'd suggest going out for popcorn during either the first hour or the third, because the second features some pretty good big-screen effects involving planes, ships, and explosions."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"The chaos is convincing, but, less ruthless than Steven Spielberg, Bay eschews D-day panic and mutilation."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"A Michael Bay movie: bang bang, paper-thin characters, wooden screenplay."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,"I found ""Pearl Harbor"" annoying but not excruciating—even at three hours, it's less assaultive than either ""The Mummy Returns"" or ""Moulin Rouge."""
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,"The film has no soul. An epic about this day of infamy should shake you to the core. But the real infamy about Pearl Harbor is that when you exit, you don't feel a thing."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,"Its centerpiece is 40 minutes of redundant special effects, surrounded by a love story of stunning banality."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,"Perhaps they should have called this ""Bore-a, Bore-a, Bore-a."""
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,"Just compare their superficiality to the complex characters in ""From Here to Eternity"" and what's missing here becomes terribly clear."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,Fiction and fantasy to evade reflection on the world we actually live in.
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,83,"Pure, light entertainment."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,80,"The grandeur of the effects--the honest-to-God spectacle of the thing--elevates Monsters vs. Aliens to something approaching art. It's not a masterpiece, but it's most certainly a milestone."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,80,"The richly multilayered picture tends to have a gently immersive effect, akin to a stroll through the world's most expensive diorama."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,80,"Yayyyy, monsters!"
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,75,The movie may best be appreciated by people who know the references. All five monsters come from low-budget science fiction films of the 1950s.
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,75,"Full disclosure: I saw Monsters vs. Aliens in 2-D. No dorky plastic glasses, no alien ooze flying at my head. More full disclosure: I liked it."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,75,This is a pleasure to watch for everyone.
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,75,"Dazzling colors, winning characters and energetic visual effects all work in concert, with the 3-D animation serving to intensify the experience."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,75,"This is a lean 90 minutes, packed with laughs and age-appropriate thrills -- not to mention a solid lesson for girls about self-respect."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,75,"My favorite voice/animation combo, however, is Stephen Colbert's very terrestrial president of the United States."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,70,There is a nice mix of action with tender moments -- especially among the misfit monsters
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,70,"A film of chuckles, smiles and light amusement rather than big laughs, galvanizing excitement and original invention."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,70,"Another crowd-pleasing, expert-babysitting vaudeville turn."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,70,"In fact ""nice"" is the adjective that seems to surface most in trying to pin down the film's most salient quality, which means that while the film is enjoyable enough, it is unlikely to become a classic for us, or a ""Shrek"" sort of franchise for DreamWorks."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,70,"Children won't get the references to atomic-age monster movies, but the film offers more than nostalgia: there are slyly funny performances by Seth Rogen as an omnivorous blue blob and Stephen Colbert as the U.S. president, who faces down, and then flees, an alien invasion."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,67,"On some level, the latest DreamWorks CGI project isn't a movie so much as a gag-delivery system wrapped in special effects. The story is crammed with incident, yet completely trifling; there are a ton of personalities, but no real characters."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,63,"Monsters vs. Aliens suffers from the common 3D problems: dim lighting, poor focus in fast-paced action sequences, and too many distractions for the movie to grab the viewer."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,63,3-D is a distraction and an annoyance.
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,63,"If you have to see Monsters vs. Aliens - and if you're a parent, you will have to - make sure it's the 3-D version."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,63,"""WALL-E"" had more charm, more soul, more everything. But there's enough merry mischief here to satisfy, even if you’re way past puberty."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,60,The 3D visuals are an enormous part of MVA's experience and they also help to cover up the lackluster “comedy.”
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,58,"The movie works hard -- desperately hard -- to be all things to all audience segments. And the visible effort erodes the sense of gaiety, of unfettered fun."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,55,"After a while, you can see the setups happening -- and once you do, the careening gets predictable. Which gets old, really fast."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,50,This action-comedy will seem fresh only to 8-year-olds -- though it may give parents an excuse to introduce some of the '50s horror movies it parodies.
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,50,"Has bells and whistles, superb technical sophistication and dazzling visual effects, sound, fury and Reese Witherspoon. What it doesn't have is heart. Like so many vehicles that have popped out from the DreamWorks Animation snark tank, Monsters vs. Aliens is too clever by half."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,50,"The movie is curiously unmemorable, partly because nearly all of its humor depends on your having seen something like it before, even if you haven't."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,50,"Even in 3D, as the picture is being shown in some theaters -- Ginormica is a disappointingly flat character."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,50,"Despite the 3-D gadgetry, there's a musty odour to the script."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,50,"The movie is reasonably entertaining, though it helps to be 6 years old."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,50,"As I took off my gray-lensed 3-D spectacles at the end of Monsters vs. Aliens, I felt not so much immersed as fuzzy with exhaustion. What I had seen struck me less as a herald of shining possibility than as a thrill ride back to the future--back, that is, to an idea of the future, and a stale one at that."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,40,"The misfits, as ever, must take a back seat to the morality, and the result – while in no way migraine-inducing – traffics in rote truisms."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,40,"The biggest battle in Monsters vs. Aliens is banality vs. originality, and banality carries the day."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,38,"It's tough to get on board with these monsters. They don't get the banter they--or we--deserve, and the screenwriters lean on wearying stereotypes."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,38,Will pop your eyes without tickling your funny bone.
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,25,Dreamworks Animation's clunky and wildly unimaginative Monsters vs. Aliens really doesn't have a clue what to do with the [3-D] technique.
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,8.2,197171806,100,"The Harrison Ford-Sean Connery father-and-son team gives Last Crusade unexpected emotional depth, reminding us that real film magic is not in special effects."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,8.2,197171806,90,"Though it cannot regain the brash originality of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' in its own way 'The Last Crusade' is nearly as good, matching its audience's wildest hopes."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,8.2,197171806,90,"It is just as well that Last Crusade will indeed be Indy's last film. It would be too sad to see the series grow old and thin, like the James Bond movies."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,8.2,197171806,88,"Start lining up now, bring a bullwhip -- and maybe some d-Con. Indiana will do the rest."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,8.2,197171806,88,"Despite strong acting (the slapstick energy between Ford and Connery is wasted), obligatory chases and stunts and splendid art direction, the virtuoso technique evident in every frame remains formulaic--unaccompanied by revelation, epiphany or surprise."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,8.2,197171806,80,"The first of Spielberg's films to make us feel heavy in our seats, the first to leave us sitting, passive and uninvolved, on the outside. Watching it, you feel that nearly anyone could have directed it."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,8.2,197171806,75,"Mechanical, soulless."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,100,"McQuarrie understands that these films are essentially tall tales with a sense of humor, skating on the edge of parody at all times while maintaining a poker face."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,100,"I would argue that this may be the funniest of the films overall, and with Robert Elswit shooting it, it's absolutely gorgeous, with crisp, clean action choreography that you can actually see."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,90,"The action scenes are predictably magnificent, and an excellent supporting turn from fetching new cast member Rebecca Ferguson helps make this a sexy, propulsive, top-notch thriller."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,90,"The formula of ingredients is familiar and time-tested, to be sure, but some cocktails go down much better than others and McQuarrie and company have gotten theirs just right here."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,90,"At once questioning and reaffirming the pleasures of cinematic espionage, this is the rare sequel that leaves its franchise feeling not exhausted but surprisingly resurgent at 19 years and counting."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,88,"Cruise is as watchable as ever, bringing to Hunt a blend of steeliness and vulnerability."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,88,The most assured and satisfying of the five so far.
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,88,"At times the deception and the intrigue and the twists and turns make it nearly impossible follow every detail of the plot, but even when things get muddled, we know Ethan’s our hero."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,88,"[I] enjoyed McQuarrie’s ingenuity in construction, smiled occasionally at the jokes and admired Ferguson’s performance as the most interesting femme fatale in the series."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,84,"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation never pretends to be anything but a solidly entertaining collection of fighting, chasing, driving, falling and going-to-the-place-and-getting-the-thing. But at that level, it delivers completely. Choose to accept it."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,83,"Most impressively, ""Rogue Nation"" keeps the body count minimal."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,83,"The man is a movie star, underline it twice. Cruise is this young century's personification of what it takes to earn that title, a perfect storm of personality, drive and talent on delivery, incapable of irrelevance."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,83,"The M:I films remain blessedly, unfashionably self-contained: They’re stand-alone popcorn entertainments that can be watched in any order, with only the thinnest of connecting continuity between them."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,83,"Rogue Nation may not be the best, the tightest, or even the most logically coherent M:I flick, but there should be more movies like it: relentlessly thrilling, smart entertainments for folks who can’t tell the difference between Quicksilver and The Flash—and aren’t particularly interested in trying to learn the difference either."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,80,"Perhaps more than any of the M:I directors so far, McQuarrie understands the unique properties of this singular movie star — his ascetic intensity, his sometimes-scary moral certainty, his always-scary drive to excel. The result of their collaboration is a briskly paced and witty reminder of why we go see summer action movies in the first place."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,80,"McQuarrie is adept at keeping things moving and has overseen two areas where ""Rogue Nation"" stands out from the crowd."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,80,"The perfect summer action flick. It’s full of attractive people, gorgeous locations, loathsome bad guys and a pounding score that ties it all together. This is what the “Fast and Furious” movies want to be, and the Bond pictures used to."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,80,"Easily, almost nonchalantly, best in franchise, Rogue Nation dispenses with the dead weight of realism or relevance for state-of-the-art thrill-making in a classical mould. The series has finally found its voice."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,80,"Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation might have its hi-tech gadgets, but it's a pleasingly old-fashioned affair."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,"Physically ripped, constantly engaged and possessing a quite possibly insane desire to do each and every one of his own stunts, Cruise is the platonic ideal of an action star. And thank god for that."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation doubles as a two-hour celebrity episode of American Ninja Warrior for Tom Cruise.
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,"Rogue Nation unfolds with fluid, twisty, old-school pleasure — you settle into it like a favorite chair."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,"The great strength of McQuarrie is that, even when he’s leaning into the laughs, he plays it straight — he doesn’t sacrifice inviolable core values in the name of escapism, whether in the form of smart writing or superb production aesthetics."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,"McQuarrie devises a film that’s a succession of riveting sequences, filmed in a way that’s active and yet elegant. The camera keeps moving within shots, but not in a subjective, jittery way, but rather like a third person narrator calmly emphasizing the essential points."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,The film offers everything one could ask for from popcorn entertainment.
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,"McQuarrie — an Oscar winner for his script for 1995's ""The Usual Suspects"" — has an ace to play. That's the indie sensibility he brings to the usual Hollywood FX."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,It can't resist winking at how this franchise manages to defy the limits of both human endurance and its superstar's rickety public status.
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,"Ultimately, as inconsequential as it all is, Rogue Nation is not pretending to be anything it isn’t. And as a sensory escapist experience with laughs, pleasures, and excitement, Rogue Nation will likely be a most satisfying mission audiences choose to accept repeatedly."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,"Rogue Nation plays out like a sufficient rejigging of the same variables tossed around many times before, which is just enough to both celebrate the material and demonstrate its limitations."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,70,"Of the many heists and grabs that litter the movie, none is as blatant as the deft, irrepressible manner in which Ferguson, displaying a light smile and a brisk way with a knife, steals the show. Poor Tom Cruise. He can’t even steal a kiss."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,70,"It’s a diverting ride, played out against spectacular locations, that repackages a whole bunch of familiar elements and attitudes: A little latter-day Bond, a little Jason Bourne, a little John le Carré, a little 1950s Hitchcock."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,70,"Sleek and bloated, specific and generic, “Rogue Nation” is pretty much like most of the “Impossible” movies in that it’s an immense machine that Mr. McQuarrie, after tinkering and oiling, has cranked up again and set humming with twists and turns, global trotting and gadgets, a crack supporting cast and a hard-working star."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,70,"The best reason to see Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation is Rebecca Ferguson, a Swedish-born actress passing easily as a British spy named Ilsa."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,70,"It’s amazing, and genuinely touching. At the age of 53 Mr. Cruise continues to give his all to these films, and his all in this latest episode is more than enough."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,70,"McQuarrie delivers a tense, eye-popping amusement-park ride that’s almost as exciting as it is forgettable."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,70,"The older Cruise gets, the more he relies on his fists. (And his abs, and his nerves — he'll never let you forget he does his own stunts, and why should he?) His body is the wonder-gizmo, and Christopher McQuarrie, writer and director of the fifth entry, Rogue Nation, keeps the camera on him like a nature show about a hungry lion."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,67,"Once you accept the fact that “Rogue Nation” is not going to be the wingding of the franchise, it becomes a lot easier to enjoy."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,67,"Overall, Rogue Nation is a solid, mildly subversive entry into the series that will have you humming Lalo Schifrin’s indelible theme music for the rest of the week, but probably not lingering over the finer points of the plot."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,63,"There's a difference between velocity and momentum, and while the chases, shootouts and close-quarters combat rarely flag, our interest does."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,63,The movie is better when it’s poking sly fun at Cruise’s superheroic screen persona (look at the expression on his face when Ethan realizes just how big the guy he must fight is) than when it asks you to buy into its far-fetched antics.
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,60,"A sequel that is slick with silliness, but peppered with enough wit and peril to sustain the franchise’s momentum."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,60,Rogue Nation is an uneven film.
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,60,"Its fuse fizzes dutifully from A to B, but the dynamite never ignites."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,50,"Neither bad enough to be a complete waste of time nor good enough to remember past next Tuesday, the film co-written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie staples together one routine action piece after another with cutesy dialogue and lots of merciless pounding away at iPad screens."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,50,"Jokier and more obviously derivative, Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation is the funniest “MI” picture, and maybe the worst of the series."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,40,By the third act all the stone-stepping plot points that get us from set-piece A to set-piece B start to wear thin.
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,88,"A hugely enjoyable shambles. It’s a comic deconstruction of that most useless of Hollywood artifacts — the blockbuster sequel — that refuses to take itself seriously on any level, which, face it, is just what we need as the summer boom-boom season shifts into high gear."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,83,"“22” merits a B grade. The long final credits, in which Dickson imagines dozens of future scenarios for the undercover boys, kicks it up one notch."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,83,"Just think back to everything that was funny in ""21 Jump Street."" It's exactly the same."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,83,"Suffice it to say that it is a cannily-constructed film, and it does have a bigger ""movie"" feel than the first film. There are places where they swing for some big jokes that don't quite work, but the ambition is dizzying all the way through."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,83,"22 Jump Street might not be quite as good as ""21 Jump Street,"" but it's remarkably close, to the point where subsequent viewings could see it elevated above its predecessor."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,80,"A great deal of insanity ensues, none of which would work if Tatum and Hill weren't so disarming in their roles. Their level of comfort with the characters and each other helps 22 click."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,80,"More is more and is, at times, just right in 22 Jump Street, an exploding piñata of gags, pratfalls, winking asides, throwaway one-liners and self-reflexive waggery."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,80,"22 Jump Street is, ultimately, a celebration of the silly and the sweet, a combination that's welcome again and again."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,80,"22 Jump Street is a success, as there is a little good ol’ fashioned “heart” beneath its post-modern veneer."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,80,Bigger and better – 22 Jump Street joins the exclusive list of sequels that out-gun their originals. We’re already knocking at the door of no.23.
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,80,Rare is the film that understands the pleasures of letting an enraged Ice Cube take out his wrath on an all-you-can-eat buffet. And which other blockbuster in 2014 would interrupt its climactic car chase to lob in a gag about Benny Hill?
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,80,"It certainly provides that rarest of things: relaxing enjoyment. In all its uncompromising goofiness, 22 Jump Street brings onstream a sugar-rush of entertainment."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,80,"This excellent film is a sequel and knows it, and wants us to know that it knows it."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,80,"22 Jump Street is hugely successful in retaining - and in many instances, improving upon - the qualities of it predecessor and pitching some jokes that will still have people chuckling for days afterwards."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,80,"A few of the self-referential gags get recycled one too many times, but an exuberant buoyancy — and the belly-laugh-a-minute pacing of the jokes — makes 22 Jump Street a hilarious highpoint of an already quite funny summer season."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,80,"It's laugh-packed, self-aware in a manner that lets everyone in on the joke, and goofily satisfying in the action department."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,80,"22 Jump Street hits far more often than it misses, and even when it misses by a mile, the effort is so delightfully zany that it’s hard not to give Lord and Miller an “A” for effort."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,75,Filmmakers Phil Lord and Chris Miller (who are themselves impressive partners at this point) know enough not to mess with a successful formula.
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,75,It's a self-aware movie that makes fun of the macho clichés it indulges.
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,75,"This is a sequel that wears its well-worn formula, mocking inside jokes and gleeful taste for overkill proudly, flying the high-lowbrow flag for audiences that like their comedy just smart enough to be not-too-dumb."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,75,"The car chases are unremarkable, but the stunts — which comically juxtapose Tatum's athletic grace and Hill's stocky clumsiness — are a hoot."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,75,"Thanks to this team of merry pranksters, 22 Jump Street hurts so good."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,75,"22 Jump Street is exactly what comedy is today. It's coarse, free-flowing and playful."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,75,The sharp writing and tag-team antics lift 22 Jump Street to a high level.
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,75,"The movie wouldn’t work, of course, without the chemistry between Hill and Tatum, an unlikely duo who share a tremendous charisma."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,75,"Be sure to hang around for the closing credits, which imagine all sorts of ""Jump Street"" sequels to come."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,75,22 Jump Street is a mixed bag of clever spoofery and miscalculated outrageousness. The unveiled homoeroticism of practically all interaction between Jenko and Schmidt is amusing to the point when it isn't.
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,75,"A comedy about sequels. Like its predecessor, the movie continually teeters on the edge of breaking through the fourth wall."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,75,"There are certainly a lot of actors who can match Hill and Tatum as comic actors, but it’s the oddball connection between these two that makes for a very entertaining couple of hours at the movies."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,75,"This comedy produces the biggest, loudest laughs of any movie this summer."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,70,"22 Jump Street is hardly fresh, but the picture has enough energy to get by."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,70,"The best comic turns are by the Afro-Asian twins Keith and Kenny Lucas, whose timing is eerie and superb."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,70,"The repetitions are meant as a sort of metajoke, and it works well enough, more often than not, though heightened levels of raunch and chaos seem not so much meta as frantic."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,70,"22 Jump Street squeezes every last drop of comic inspiration it can get from Tatum and Hill, as well as the very notion of a sequel to such a superfluous enterprise."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,70,"22 Jump Street isn't uncharitable or mean-spirited; at worst, it's just confused. Tatum is, predictably, adorable. His Jenko is a pumped-up naïf bumbling through life with a crooked smile, and Hill again makes a great sparring partner."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,67,"To cover up the script's lack of originality, screenwriters Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel, and Rodney Rothman pummel us with a string of self-aware meta-commentary jokes that poke fun at bloated sequels."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,63,"There are times when 22 Jump Street is borderline brilliant. Unfortunately, those instances are outnumbered by segments that don't work for one reason or another."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,63,"22 Jump Street's scattershot approach to comedy is rooted in the belief that for every anatomical, scatalogical, sexual, or pop-cultural reference and pun gone awry, another will stick to the wall like, um, bodily fluid."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,60,"Here's the crazy thing, though. Against all odds, it works."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,60,"At its best, 22 Jump Street is less an action comedy than a loosely plotted revue, and though it’s not as witty as either Joe Dante’s ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" or Edgar Wright’s ""Hot Fuzz"" (in which the directors evinced genuine love for their chosen genres), it’s sure as hell better than a straight buddy-cop sequel."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,60,"22 Jump Street is the good-natured, sloppily rendered pile of balderdash for that moment, a movie that’s immune to all criticism and not worth bothering to dislike."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,60,"The laughs are what keep the film together, even when the conceit feels been-there-done-that."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,60,"22 Jump Street knows how to play to its strengths: Tatum’s performance here is even more puppy-dog lovable than last time, and his scenes with Hill possess a goofy, low-key warmth too often lacking in big-budget comedy."
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,50,An unusually fun and funny film.
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,50,What’s the difference between “21 Jump Street” and 22 Jump Street? Same as the difference between getting a 21 and a 22 at blackjack.
22 Jump Street,7,191719337,50,"As funny and batshit insane as the movie often is, the fact that 22 Jump Street knows it's a tiresome sequel doesn't save it from being a tiresome sequel, even as Lord and Miller struggle to conceal the bitter pill of convention in the sweet tapioca pudding of wall-to-wall jokes."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,63,"[A] basically brainless but intermittently adrenalizing, mostly-just-for-kids reboot."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,58,"Turtles is head-and-shell better than ""Transformers."" Cowabunga?"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,58,"What the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles lacks is not fidelity, but a spirit of genuine boyish fun."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,58,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is about as predictable as movies get these days.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,50,"A consistently workmanlike helmer, Liebesman (Wrath of the Titans, Battle: Los Angeles) keeps the pace brisk and the overall tone closer to that of the recent G.I. Joe vehicles, infusing this glorified toy commercial with an almost aggressively knowing sense of humor and exactly one fun action sequence on New York’s most conveniently located mountaintop."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,50,"A dark, shaky, standard-issue superhero picture."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,50,"While this reboot is fun, it’s also forgettable and occasionally infuriating."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,50,"The action beats are bigger and better than they’ve ever been in a Ninja Turtle film — brawls, shootouts, a snowy car-and-truck chase with big explosions and what not. But in between those scenes is an awful lot of chatter and exposition. For a film that aims younger (save for the die-hards who grew up with this franchise), that’s deadly dull."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,50,The castmembers portraying Splinter and the turtles achieve a persuasive level of realism that was never possible with the elaborate puppetry required for the original film series and adequately fulfill expectations for their characters.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,42,"It can't be overstated what kind of a marvel these Turtles are onscreen, however. As crude and unpleasant their design might be, they feel like living, breathing things, not special effects."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,40,Heroes in a half-arsed shell.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,40,"This extremely stupid movie, with its recycled Batman/Spider-Man-style plot involving a dead father, an evil scientist-tycoon (played by the reliably terrific William Fichtner) and a massive criminal underworld of masked thugs, also features the best action sequence of the summer, bar none. I’m not kidding!"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,40,"Largely indistinguishable from any number of bloated superhero spectacles that have already graced our screens. Your kids may not mind it, but it’s more insistent than it is fun."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,40,"A certain kind of discipline and experience is at work here: It’s no accident that the action and dialogue seem blandly cartoonish, as if the moviemakers wanted to keep everything easy for all ages to follow."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,40,"Not out-and-out terrible enough to be completely dismissed, while also not particularly memorable either, perhaps the truest summation of the film is to say simply that the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a movie that exists."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,40,"It's just kind of a mess, as unfocused and immature as the four mutant turtles at its core. Stuff happens, stuff blows up and this is probably a good time to mention that Michael Bay produced the film."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,40,"Utterly inessential, this slightly cheap-looking reboot of the Turtles franchise is froth too — it might even be too tame for the kids who make up the target audience."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,40,Neither a particularly good movie nor the pop-cultural travesty that some were dreading.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,38,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles doesn't so much provide brainless enjoyment as it pummels the viewer into submission. ""Shell-shocked"" is a reasonable description of the experience."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,38,"If TMNT the franchise is going to reach the same lofty heights of blockbuster-dom, it still needs to find its own inner hero."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,38,"If nothing else, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles reminds us that nostalgia is often used as a mandate for spectacularly lazy filmmaking."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,38,"The repartee, as ever, is weak. Even with all the extra layers of digital detail, it’s still tough to keep these four straight. And the CG characters’ slimy rendering and motion-capture expressiveness could go down with “The Polar Express” as a study in inadvertent, technologically misguided screen creepiness. Wackier would have been OK, guys — it’s the Ninja Turtles."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,38,"Is there a word that means the opposite of Cowabunga? If so, that's the word for the charmless, dull and derivative new take on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,30,"This TMNT is bigger and emptier, a wasteland of pixels."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,30,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles isn’t a movie; it’s a brand re-launch that’s going to satisfy stockholders far more than it’s going to entertain the people who paid to watch it.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,30,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a movie that takes its characters and its premise seriously, until it doesn't, and that operates at two speeds: tortoise (ponderous) and hare (head-spinning)."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,25,"They’ve been around so long that they’re now the Middle-Aged Mutant Ninja Turtles, and their ’80s vibe — cowabunga, dude! — is so strong that I kept expecting a cameo by Huey Lewis or Max Headroom."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,25,A film so overworked to ensure mass-market appeal that it loses the charming oddness and loose goofiness that has allowed these characters to endure.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,25,"Young kids will find the second, more action-heavy half of the film entertaining, but everyone else will want to crawl into their shell."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,20,"TMNT confuses “dimly lit” for “gritty” and humorless for substantive. It’s afraid of being too fun or too light, and doesn’t seem to know whether it wants to be a Nolan film or a 21 Jump Street-style spoof."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,20,"Teenagers, even non-ninjas and non-turtles, have been eating up this cinematic waste product for weeks now. In one way, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a triumph for producer Michael Bay in that it is equally as godawful as his ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" and a hit nonetheless."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,5.8,191204754,0,"The cloddish, confusing action scenes make no sense. Young viewers’ eyes will glaze from the first-person video-game style. Nonaction scenes feature people sniping at each other, or, in Arnett’s case, croaking out the script’s half-assed witticisms, until the Turtles show up."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,80,"Retains the earlier film's ability to delight the viewer with surprise effects and flights of fancy, only now the effects are better."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,75,"The hang-loose grodiness of these films has its charms, and the Ray-Banned team of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, at its best, is good vaudeville."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,70,"It's visual magic, and director Barry Sonnenfeld, who followed his MIB high with the lows of ""Wild Wild West"" and ""Big Trouble,"" revels in it. He doesn't so much direct MIBII as load it with cool stuff and flit around to whatever takes his fancy. As summer escapism goes, you could do worse."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,70,It's a welcome and nicely goofy bit of sci-fi froth with the occasional hint of genuine comic smarts.
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,67,"Short, flashy and about as complex as a beer belch, Men in Black II is also brisk. The film clocks in at 88 minutes total running time, and it's loaded with new special effects and monsters."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,63,Would be a thoroughly entertaining affair if it wasn't for one thing: the plot. The annoying and pointless storyline is a constant irritant because it diverts our attention from the real reason to see this movie - the easygoing chemistry between actors Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,63,"So eager to please, it practically licks you in the face."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,63,"Large budget notwithstanding, the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride. But this time, the old MIB label stands for Milder Isn't Better."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,63,"The most refreshing thing about the original Men in Black was that it was relatively small - a modest, slapdash, 98-minute special-effects farce. The most refreshing thing about Men in Black II is that it is 10 minutes shorter."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,63,"Elaborate, sporadically amusing but awfully lightweight followup, which has close to the same tone as its predecessor but makes one realize that freshness had a lot to do with its impact."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,63,"Hey, I'm not saying it's bad. It's kind of entertaining, what I can recall of it after two days. It's, uh, okay. Just okay, though."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,60,The only active ingredient is the dynamic between Smith and Jones. There's just enough of that to get us through.
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,60,"As fizzy as the first, but not quite as refreshing. The pleasurable, eye-popping sense of surprise has diminished, and the teasingly referential attitude shows signs of fatigue."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,60,Some motion pictures portray ultimate passion; others create ultimate thrills. Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic.
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,60,"There's something wrong with this picture, and the problem is there on Smith's face -- Smith looks distressingly I-was-an-Oscar-nominee bored. That goes double for Jones."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,60,"To his eternal credit, Jones gives his considerable all and even coaxes a startling note of poignancy from one scene, while Smith just bops along, lobbing gags and grinning at the special effects."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,60,"Suffers from a fatal lack of purpose. This sleek, visually inventive but frustratingly flat movie is made up entirely of throwaway bits -- occasionally amusing, even ingenious bits. But still, they're just bits."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,58,"However cool, Smith's lovable braggadocio and Lee's practiced deadpan don't exactly make them Laurel and Hardy."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,It's a stylish package with not much inside.
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,A talking bulldog named Frank steals the show.
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,"None of it sticks, but with the door left open for a third Men In Black movie, the one advantage of forgetting everything is not knowing exactly what's coming two summers from now."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,A business-as-usual blockbuster blueprint that rarely surprises you.
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,"On the positive side, the four Worm Guys haven't lost their squiggly charm, and Rip Torn is always welcome as MIB mastermind Zed. On the minus side, you get two Johnny Knoxvilles, one of them a tiny head that protrudes from the big one's shoulder."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,"Moderately amusing sequel, which is best when it relies on dead-pan acting by the stars, worst when it drags in summer-movie stupidities like an incessantly talking dog."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,"For all its bells and whistles, only when it lingers on Jones' dry wit and pained, rheumy eyes does this film about aliens ever seem alive, let alone human."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,Here's an idea: Let's just take that same gizmo-packed alien-attack buddy-flick blockbuster from the summer of '97 ... and make it dumber!
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,"Smith and Jones sometimes have to paddle hard to keep their heads above the toilet water in which screenwriters Robert Gordon (Galaxy Quest) and Barry Fanaro (Kingpin) occasionally dunk them. But if the presence of Smith and Jones is indeed the tinker-proof ingredient of the Men in Black formula, little else seems to have survived the production unaltered."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,"A disappointment. A good-faith attempt has been made to duplicate the original elements, but the mix is wrong, bearings have been lost, the balance is off. It was attitude that made ""Men in Black"" special, a particular kind of cool insouciance that has proved as impossible to duplicate as it was irresistible to experience."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,42,"The astonishing success of the original ""MiB"" was partly because it was fun, partly because it was unexpected. We'd never seen anything like it, while with MiBII, we've seen something exactly like it."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,40,"Smith and Jones seem like superannuated company men: They're going through the motions, but the zip is gone."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,40,"Mercifully short -- a mere 80 minutes, plus the end-titles. That means I had to slap myself in the face fewer times than usual to stay awake in a movie this grindingly mediocre."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,40,"If it isn't the worst sequel ever made, it's only because it has too much competition: Impersonal and frenetic, it's a landmark Hollywood disgrace."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Although Dunkirk is not as labyrinthine as Nolan’s “Memento” (2000) or “Inception” (2010), its strike rate upon our senses is rarely in doubt, and there is a beautiful justice in watching it end, as it has to, in flames. Land, sea, air, and, finally, fire: the elements are complete, honor is salvaged, and the men who were lost scrape home."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"The surpassing accomplishment of Dunkirk is to make us feel an almost literal fusion with its story. It's not so much that we've seen a splendid movie, though we have, but as if we've been taken inside a historic event, become wholly immersed in something real and alive."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Seldom has a film so eloquently captured the craziness, brutality and arbitrariness of war. Dunkirk just might be Nolan’s masterpiece."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Technically awe-inspiring, narratively inventive and thematically complex, Dunkirk reinvigorates its genre with a war movie that is both harrowing and smart."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Dunkirk is a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday’s fights and today’s."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Dunkirk isn’t comfortable to watch; it never relents or relaxes. At the same time, it’s impossible to look away from it."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Nolan maintains gut-wrenching suspense throughout by cross-cutting between the various characters and their plights. I’d go so far to say that Dunkirk could easily serve as its own master class in the art of film editing. Add to that an absolutely terrifyingly discordant score from Hans Zimmer and the result is, well, a bona fide classic."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"In Dunkirk, an astonishing evocation of a crucial event during the first year of World War II, Christopher Nolan has created something new in the annals of war films—an intimate epic."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Dunkirk is extraordinary not just because it’s ambitious and beautifully executed, but because Nolan, who both wrote and directed it, has put so much care into its emotional details—and has asked so much of, and trusted, his actors."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"It’s one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies — they are rare — that lift you out of your present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. Dunkirk is that kind of movie."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,Dunkirk succeeds spectacularly both emotionally and visually.
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"By minimalizing his loftier techniques and tendencies of the past with brusque pacing and grand photography, Nolan has assembled the leanest and most impassioned film of his career."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Dunkirk is a great movie, both an old-time inspirational war epic and at the same time very much a Christopher Nolan movie."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,Dunkirk is a landmark with the resonant force of an enduring screen classic.
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"The director's technical mastery finally transcends craft to become art and, as a result, this is his best film to date."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"The swift-moving, pulse-pounding Dunkirk reveals its filmmaker at his most nimble, supple, and simple."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Nolan has crafted a tight, gripping, deeply involving and unforgettable film that ranks about the best war movies of the decade."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"There may be money on the screen, but cash alone can’t guarantee this kind of pulsating, cinematic magic, delivered by a director at the height of his powers, mustering the very best at their craft."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,Nolan fully embraces the power of visual storytelling in Dunkirk.
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"This is what audiences want from a Nolan movie, of course, as a master of the fantastic leaves his mark on historical events for the first time."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Dunkirk is a staggering feat of filmmaking, as Nolan's fans are accustomed. Van Hoytema's cinematography conveys death trap closeness even with IMAX cameras on a vast beach. Hans Zimmer again proves himself a masterfully dramatic composer, turning violins into the sound of spiraling aircraft. The performances are solid as such Nolan's vision requires, including pop star Harry Styles briefly."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Dunkirk is an impressionist masterpiece. These are not the first words you expect to see applied to a giant-budgeted summer entertainment made by one of the industry's most dependably commercial big-name directors. But this is a war film like few others, one that may employ a large and expensive canvas but that conveys the whole through isolated, brilliantly realized, often private moments more than via sheer spectacle, although that is here too."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Haunting, thrilling and emotional, Dunkirk is a prestige pic with guts and glory that demands multiple views. Especially in IMAX."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Christopher Nolan’s astonishing new film...is a work of heart-hammering intensity and grandeur that demands to be seen on the best and biggest screen within reach. But its spectacle doesn’t stop at the recreations of Second World War combat.  Like all great war films, it’s every bit as transfixing up close."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"A spare, propulsive, ever-intensifying combat thriller, Nolan's history lesson is both a rousing celebration of solidarity and the tensest beach-set film since Jaws."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"This is visceral, big-budget filmmaking that can be called Art. It’s also, hands down, the best motion picture of the year so far."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"This is a powerful, superbly crafted film with a story to tell, avoiding war porn in favour of something desolate and apocalyptic, a beachscape of shame, littered with soldiers zombified with defeat, a grimly male world with hardly any women on screen. It is Nolan’s best film so far."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,There have been countless films this summer that have engaged in endless spectacle but Dunkirk is the rare blockbuster that will leave a bruise.
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Few movies have so palpably conveyed the sheer isolation of fear, and the extent to which history is often made by people who are just trying to survive it — few movies have so vividly illustrated that one man can only do as much for his country as a country can do for one of its men."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Great directors make great movies. And with Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan has made his second masterpiece, thrilling history retold, remembered and relished."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,98,"It is hard to imagine a better tribute to this victory of survival than Nolan’s spare, stunning, extraordinarily ambitious film."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,97,"It takes everything Nolan does well and everything he doesn’t, everything he fights against and everything he embraces, everything great and terrible about him, and streamlines it, focuses it, until it’s pure Nolan, straight into your veins. It’s the most Christopher Nolan film imaginable. It also might just be his best one."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,97,"Nolan has crafted a film that’s sensational in every sense of the word; it aims for both the heart and the head, to be sure, but arrives there via the central nervous system."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,95,"Dunkirk is a monumental, unconventional, and frequently stunning war movie."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,91,"Christopher Nolan’s terrific new film, Dunkirk, is powered by an engine of combusting contradictions: it’s at once minimalist and maximalist, cynical and dopey, a big-boy white elephant art film that is actually a lean and mean suspense set-piece machine."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,90,"Dunkirk wants us to sense what made this moment so pivotal without reducing it to an individual tale. And at that, it succeeds richly."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,90,"Let other directors play with toy soldiers and computer effects. This is big-time, old-school filmmaking. Dunkirk isn’t overdone. It’s simply done epically...But it’s also human. It has room for small acts of heroism, of kindness, of forgiveness. And for a single, simple important, timeless message of resilience: Take what comes. Do what you can. Never surrender."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,88,"Taken as a whole, Dunkirk invites comparisons to the works of Kubrick and Spielberg, but it’s neither as scalding as “Full Metal Jacket” nor as clear-eyed, as aware of war’s terrible randomness, as “Saving Private Ryan.” Instead, a streak of honest sentiment, earned under the most hellish of circumstances, courses through this movie and provides it with spine and a soul."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,88,"Although Dunkirk is technically a war film, its tone and style are those of a high-octane thriller. For his most serious-minded film to date, Christopher Nolan has employed all the weapons in his arsenal to craft something that, despite the Oscar-unfriendly July release date, will almost certainly be remembered when the Best Picture nominations are handed out."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,88,"Nolan fractures the narrative so that it loops back on itself — we see the events from the perspective of different characters and from different chronological vantage points, though the story coheres by movie’s end."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,88,"This is a movie of vision and integrity made on an epic scale, a series of propositions dramatized with machinery, bodies, seawater and fire. It deserves to be seen and argued about. They don't make them like this anymore. Never did, really."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,88,"Dunkirk is also one of the best-scored films in recent memory, and Hans Zimmer’s music plays as important a role as any character. With shades of Edward Elgar’s Enigma Variations, the melodies are glorious, yet Zimmer also creates an instrumental ticking-clock soundtrack that’s a propulsive force in the action scenes."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,80,"It is engaging, it is intense, it is beautifully shot and it thrusts viewers credibly into the horrifying action from the very first frame -- and doesn't relent until the very last. This being Nolan, he also overcomplicates what is essentially a fairly simple story."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,80,"The action is the attraction. If that means some of the film feels a little distant and chilly, it’s in the admirable service of avoiding simplistic drama or easy sentiment."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,75,"It’s a gripping addition to the canon of war on film that is definitely worthy of attention, and some of the images are electrifying."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,75,"Dunkirk satisfies as a brisk, gripping survival story. At only 107 minutes, it’s also astonishingly short in an era when most movies needlessly run on long beyond the two-hour mark."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,75,"With a bare minimum of dialogue, and a brutal maximum of scenes depicting near-drowning situations in and around Dunkirk, France, in late May and early June 1940, Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk is a unique waterboarding of a film experience."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,70,"With tighter scripting, this’d be a masterpiece. As is? Christopher Nolan has produced a damn-fine picture that goes against most of what his catalog has become renowned for in a good, streamlined way."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,70,"What Nolan plus IMAX can do is go big. Spitfire swerving, boat tippings, men dropping to the sand as planes scream by — it doesn’t get any better. That first shot of men on a street in a shower of paper on which their deaths are foretold — brilliant. Somewhere inside the mess that is Dunkirk is a terrific linear movie."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,70,"Dunkirk would have been even better, though, if any of the characters seemed as fully realized as the aerial and naval warfare. Without that, it works best as pure sensory experience; incredible visuals, intense battles. In the rare quiet moments, we’re invited to observe an unusual instrument featured in Hans Zimmer’s score: The ticking of a clock, a reminder that while Nolan can change the march of time, his heroes cannot."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,67,"Dunkirk, with its scaled-to-be-a-masterpiece visual grandiosity, aims to be an epic of the spirit, but there is something weirdly underpowered about it. It’s a series of riveting tableaux, but the human center is lacking."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,67,"A constant movement unmoored from all but the present moment (however porously “present” is defined here) pushes Nolan forward as a visual stylist and suspense-crafter — lots of portent in the images of armies and crafts, plenty of faith in his actors to look concerned or outright distressed — as it stalls out Dunkirk in most other respects."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,38,"In devoting so much time to the dull, counterproductive mechanics of the action assembly, Dunkirk dispenses with nearly all other elements of drama."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,78,A spirited and eye-popping stealth charmer.
The Croods,7.2,187168425,75,"Considering the fact that a young girl is picking her nose on the movie poster, The Croods is surprisingly evolved."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,75,"This Chris Sanders fellow knows how to craft a heart-warming animation, and if not for a few minor problems this would have had a legitimate shot at the best animated movie of 2013."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,75,"Familiar family dynamics are amusingly exaggerated in the Paleolithic setting, where the most basic necessities require everyone's full-time attention."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,75,"The first pleasant surprise of spring, a gorgeous kids’ cartoon with heart and wit, if not exactly a firm grasp of paleontology."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,70,"As family viewing, it's pleasant enough: primitive, yes, but in a digitally sophisticated way that's boisterous, funny and will no doubt sell a lot of toys."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,67,"Although The Croods has lazy patches throughout, the conclusion is exciting and, lo and behold, surprising."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,67,"The film itself doesn’t practice what it preaches: From the typically blocky DreamWorks CGI to the emphasis on bruising slapstick over verbal wit, The Croods takes the low road at every opportunity, giving lip service to enlightenment while following a Flintstonian instinct to keep punching the clock at the quarry."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,63,"Just good, goofy fun, for a generation too young to have met Bamm-Bamm."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,63,"More than anything, the striking spectacle of primordial flora and one-of-a-kind fauna makes it easy for audiences to get pleasantly lost in the adventure."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,63,"While paying lip service to the spirit of invention and adventure, the movie doesn’t do much for the evolution of children’s animated entertainment."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,63,"The movie is well-edited and lean, a fast-paced, action-filled bit of froth that manages to be diverting and surprisingly fun."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,63,"Some of the exotic landscape the group trailblazes looks imported from “Avatar” — happily, bringing that immersively dimensionalized, eye-catching quality along with it."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,63,"At least there's Cage, who has become an astute voice actor, finding some odd, clever, energetic line readings consistently fresher than The Croods itself."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,60,"The Croods isn’t particularly smart, but it has just enough wit to keep us engaged and just enough speed to keep us from feeling restless."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,60,"The movie is at its most interesting and amusing when riffing on how cavemen might have reacted to new experiences and ideas, like fire and shoes. Whether the kiddies will appreciate that is unclear, but they’ll certainly like the voice work done by Emma Stone as Eep."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,60,"The Croods are not meant to be beauties — they are, after all, a family of Neanderthals. But is the animation meant to be ugly, too?"
The Croods,7.2,187168425,60,"The jokes only make up for the pedestrian plot for so long. There was a time when animated fare with generic stories sufficed. But now we expect more from them, because they have, pardon the pun, evolved. The Croods, like its title family, hasn’t."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,58,A handful of adrenalizing sequences of animated anarchy can't save this story from feeling overly primitive.
The Croods,7.2,187168425,58,"Though it's impressive in many technical and surface ways, The Croods lets us down on the essentials of character and story, and no amount of late-stage father/daughter bonding or vertiginous 3D cliffside tumbling can make up for that."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,50,"It’s ""Identity Thief"" with flying piranhas, or Plains, Trains & Automobiles on foot."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,50,"Good stuff comes when bad stuff happens; that's when some of the movie animation prowess kicks into high gear. But too many of the ""solutions"" the guys concoct are so impossibly complex or just downright ridiculous — puppetry comes to mind — that like the continents, it's a little too easy to drift away."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,50,"Although state-of-the-art in its rendering of textures, movement and stereography, The Croods, adopts a relatively primitive approach to storytelling with its Flintstonian construction of stock, ill-fitting narrative elements."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,50,"Sanders and DeMicco’s script doesn’t have the robust plotting, consistent wit or flavorful character development of the best family animation. And some of the voice actors have too little to work with."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,40,"Aside from a few witty Looney Tunes–esque sight gags, such as one hilarious image of a woolly mammoth being swallowed up by the tectonically shifting earth, the stereoscopic visuals are a busy, personality-free digital blur."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,40,"The Croods does a lot of things well -- even if it does none of them extraordinarily. The end result is a solidly middle-of-the-road bit of animation -- but the kind that is easily forgotten as soon as something more evolved, and original, comes along."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,40,"It's amiable enough, but it makes ""The Flintstones"" look like it was scripted by Karl Popper."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,40,But for the most part it’s Neanderthal compared to the Pixar stable.
The Croods,7.2,187168425,38,The film takes more than a few pages from the James Cameron playbook.
The Croods,7.2,187168425,25,I’d like to take back all those times I said Nicolas Cage was one of the most annoying actors on film. It turns out he’s equally terrible when he’s only on the soundtrack. And yet Cage is the least of the problems with The Croods.
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,88,"Set aside your memories of the Conan Doyle stories, save them to savor on a night this winter and enjoy this movie as a high-caliber entertainment."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,83,"Ritchie stages plenty of gunfights and beatdowns to satisfy action fans, pausing to consider the beauty of violence before resuming speed and piling on more."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,80,"A sequel confident in what it's about - bigger, better, funnier, without stretching the joke."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,75,"It's BFF and hetero life partner Dr. Watson who forms the tale's real love triangle with Holmes - escalating the first film's bromantic undercurrent of mutual admiration and ""circumstantial homosexuality"" to overt, unabashed man-love and dangerous attraction - with tantalizingly evil interloper Professor James Moriarty."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,75,"A Game of Shadows is a stronger, better realized movie that builds upon the strengths of the original and jettisons some of the weaknesses."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,70,"Occasionally thrilling, sometimes hilarious and mostly absolute claptrap. Think of it as a lot like drinking a fourth cup of holiday eggnog: Not really a good idea at all, but you might have fun."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,70,"While director Guy Ritchie's excesses and modern concessions -- among them a lot of explosions -- remain intact, the parts of this second ""Sherlock Holmes"" are considerably more rewarding."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,67,"The sequel has all the merits and demerits of its predecessor, only with a less-snarly antagonist, a more thoughtful final showdown and broader Holmes/Watson relationship jokes."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,67,"Yet here, as before, part of the movie's perversely cheeky design is that it throws away its own cleverness."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,63,"This sequel is just as profligate as its 2009 predecessor with explosions, anachronisms and quick cuts. But the dialogue is a little sharper, and Holmes gets a worthy opponent in Professor Moriarty."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,60,"The result ends up like an ""SNL"" skit: knowingly over-the-top but still fun."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,60,"A few shades brighter than its predecessor, and the action bits certainly closer to the full-throttle ""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"" mode director Guy Ritchie didn't quite capture the first time."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,60,"Ultimately, the best relationship in the movie remains that of Holmes and Watson, which is to say, Downey and Law. Their pairing is what makes the movie; the explosions and bells and whistles Ritchie employs are mere distractions."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,60,"Shadows still functions as a study in superior sequel-itude, building a fine showcase for a reimagined character and the compelling, twitchy dynamo playing him. Should Ritchie ever learn to be elementary instead of epileptically overwrought, he may one day do proper justice to both."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,60,"After quite a few tedious detours and distractions, when the film finally gets down to the business of a climax at a gathering of elite European diplomats in a precariously perched Swiss mountain castle, it becomes not half-bad."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"Something of an overlong, overblown, disorganized mess, despite being slightly better than its predecessor."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,Ritchie is simply trying to buy a good movie here -- and forgetting that a little brainpower is also required to complete the job.
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"So the sequel, A Game of Shadows, is more of the stupid same. It wouldn't matter so much if Downey and Jude Law, as the bromantic Dr. Watson, didn't look so ready to turn on the cerebral dazzle. Instead, Ritchie treats them like action goons out of his ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" basement."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"This movie wants to be a horse but, even measured in box-office millions, it's just another nag."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"Virtually every set-up and set-piece in this extravagantly tedious adventure is misleading, or worse, irrelevant."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,Simultaneously brash and dull - hardly a combustible combination.
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"There is a plot, but no real intrigue, mystery or suspense, and no inkling of anything at stake beyond a childish and belligerent idea of fun."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"It's an enjoyably demented meta-finale, the rivals showing what they could do if they ever bothered to actually do it."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"Fresh inspiration is sparse here; the sequel is less an extension than a remake. Holmes says of one of his lamer disguises, ""It's so overt, it's covert."" And the shadow in this game is the imposing penumbra of Ritchie's very satisfying 2009 film. It's overt and overwhelming."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"I found this sequel more tolerable than Sherlock Holmes (2009), though I'm not sure whether it's actually better or I've just accepted the putrid idea of turning Arthur Conan Doyle's brainy detective into just another quipping action hero."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"The final 30 odd minutes of this revisionist Holmes explodathon are downright thrilling, and it should go without saying but we'll restate it for the record: Downey Jr. inhabits the role of Sherlock Holmes to a near-molecular level."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"Ritchie has made a film that's so busy, it starts to become boring."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"Director Guy Ritchie is like a Heismann-winning football player cast in a ballet stage-perfectly talented, but wrong for the circumstance."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"Lackluster screenwriting and the absence of actorly communion are breezed past with monotonous banter, as is the fleetingly visible plot."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,42,"What this film really celebrates is crunch-and-thud video-game-style action, not especially well choreographed by director Guy Ritchie."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,40,"The only reason to put yourself through Guy Ritchie's overblown, inelegant Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows is to see Jared Harris, who plays Professor Moriarty, in a chilling low key."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,40,"Though the film features Holmes' fiercest villain and a plot partially cribbed from ""The Final Problem,"" one of Conan Doyle's most beloved stories, the sense of mystery has gone missing. A most heinous crime has taken place. The fun, too, is nowhere in evidence."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,40,"Now the two men are back, along with Irene. But she vanishes all too soon in this overproduced, self-enchanted sequel, and so does the spirit of bright invention that made the previous film such a pleasant surprise."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,38,"So moron-friendly they should have called it ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Checkers."" The skill level in the script is elementary school, my dear Watson."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,38,"As in the first ""Sherlock Holmes"" movie, there are plenty of pratfalls and bare-knuckle brawls but no sleuthing for us to share."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,25,Certainly Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's creations have suffered permanent damage thanks to Ritchie's films.
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,25,Wither the rollicking verve and whip-crack humor in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows?
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,0,There's nothing here but wreckage. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is so ineptly made that the story is advanced solely through announcements.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,80,"Everybody is good at one thing, they say; for Emmerich, it's destruction."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,80,This highly entertaining spin on eco-catastrophe could turn the most meteorologically challenged among us into Weather Channel freaks.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,80,"Despite the clunky bits, ""Tomorrow"" still manages to deliver the blockbuster goods."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,75,"Yes, the movie is profoundly silly. What surprised me is that it's also very scary. The special effects are on such an awesome scale that the movie works despite its cornball plotting."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,75,"The spectacle, which is colossal and at times staggering to behold, begins within two minutes of the fade-in and keeps coming until the finish. I thought I'd seen it all. I hadn't."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,75,"Better than his previous films, The Day After Tomorrow plays to Emmerich's strengths, making for a thrill ride that rarely disappoints when it matters."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,70,"A disarmingly pulpy, eye-popping disaster movie during its first half, and an increasingly dull survival melodrama during its second."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,67,"Several of the special-effects sequences -- a Tokyo hailstorm, a system of tornadoes ripping through L.A. (and tearing up the Hollywood sign), a tidal wave breaking on the East Side and washing through the canyons of Manhattan -- are just dandy."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,67,"Emmerichs sense of irony has rarely been so pointed, and The Day After Tomorrow, for all its obvious cataclysmic set-pieces and stock characterizations, is nothing if not timely."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,67,Delivers the expected thrills and groans.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,"The Day After Tomorrow is filled with bad dialogue, stock peril situations, and sketchy character development, but it's a big enough spectacle that those things don't completely derail the film's capacity to be enjoyed."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,"Never mind the cool, convincing effects (and they are cool), The Day After Tomorrow teems with illogical action, improbable coincidences. It's pure escapist fare, a popcorn gobbler."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,"This often entertaining movie mixes grand, epic effects and amazing visualizations of catastrophe with a sappy family-in-crisis plot that would look hackneyed in a '60s Disney TV movie."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,"Disaster movies, from ""The Poseidon Adventure"" to ""Towering Inferno,"" are impossible to take seriously and ""Day"" is no exception - it's simply a fast-moving pageant of end-of-the-world eye candy."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,I'm not saying that a date with this picture is all pleasure; but it's not all guilt either.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,"The real top billing, what audience-goers are obviously shelling out to see, is the computer-generated chaos, and as they should: Digital technology has caught up with our collective imaginations Now More Than Ever."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,60,The really good news is that the disaster money shots are some of the finest ever filmed.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,60,It's the Weather Channel on steroids.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,58,"A decent disaster pic comes down to the handful of colorful individuals who will live (or, depending on the prominence of their billing, die), as it has since the days of chewy disaster meatballs like ''The Towering Inferno'' and ''Earthquake.'' And the heaviest lifting in Emmerich's production falls to Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"What most hurts The Day After Tomorrow is its unfortunate, lecturing tone."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"All this amounts to a badly wasted opportunity, since global warming is a serious issue that deserves thoughtful treatment. So stay home and read a scientific journal instead. This is a disaster movie that lives up to its label."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"Packed with digs at Bush-Cheney that even Democrats could find heavy-handed, the movie's lumbering approach reminds us that, OK, Emmerich did ""Independence Day"" -- but also 1998's ""Godzilla,"" which began sinking back into the sea in week two."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"The glacierization of half of the world's inhabited land is contemplated with barely a hint of horror. In fact, it looks kind of cool."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"Really bad movies can be fun, and the dialogue here often attains a level of joyful inanity."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,Emmerich does know his way around an action scene -- there's an exciting sequence in which Sam and his buddies run from wolves while looking for meds inside the huge ship that pulls up alongside the library. But he's a master of disaster with no people skills. The characters in The Day After Tomorrow are fantastically stupid.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"Needless to say, the movie fails as a cautionary tale. But it fulfills its summer air-conditioning duties with flippant ease, and its enjoyably cloddish attempts at political relevance add a fascinating layer of incongruity."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,"The story is too silly, too woefully underwritten, to stake a claim on seriousness."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,The generally competent B-list actors are hobbled by cliché-ridden dialogue but do their best to react in remotely plausible ways each time the script nails them with some new melodramatic contrivance.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,"Despite the fact that The Day After Tomorrow is harnessed to the very real threat of global warming, it's still just a big, dumb movie, another Hollywood entertainment that, instead of tweaking and teasing our brains for fun, leaves us feeling thick and stupid."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,"While it's marvelously refreshing to observe Mother Nature obliterating L.A. and New York along with caricatures of ghastly world leaders, almost everything good is in the trailer, save perhaps brief run-ins with malevolent wolves and Ian Holm."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,An exceptionally stupid movie.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,"Utterly shatters the illusion with a trite plot, banal dialogue, clunky sentimentality and, worst of all, a sort of narrative arbitrariness."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,30,"Emmerich now directs entirely in watered-down Spielbergisms, and his storytelling skills, never strong, have gone slack. His talent for stretching a concept that can be described in 10 seconds into a feature-length movie, on the other hand, remains impressive."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,30,"When it comes to weaving personal stories in and out of the special-effects set pieces, the director has the most colossal antitalent since Ed Wood Jr."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,30,The catastrophe is so pulped and exaggerated that uninformed audiences will safely assume that global warming is just a Democratic scare tactic.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,30,Don't ask whether or not you should take The Day After Tomorrow seriously. Don't take it at all.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,80,"A kicky, twisted thrill ride, with enough laughs to leaven what can be read, at heart, as a metaphor for the modern marriage."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,80,"Expertly tossing off the type of well-sharpened banter that was the domain of Gable and Lombard and Tracy and Hepburn, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie -- no matter what their off-camera status -- make one swell combative couple."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,80,"A full-on action flick, subversive rom-com and weapons-grade star vehicle that’s drenched in Tinseltown glitz, from a director who knows how to put the money on the screen while his tongue’s firmly in his cheek."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,80,A cool summer thriller whose laughs don't slow down the suspense.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,80,Plays like an old-fashioned romantic comedy with updated hardware.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,75,"Jolie and Pitt project more than just body heat. They convey a multi-faceted attraction, toss off clever repartee and dazzle audiences with their seemingly natural connection. And that's worth watching."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,75,The screen smokes with sexual heat. But what's really erotic is how much fun the actors seem to be having.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,75,"What makes the movie work is that Pitt and Jolie have fun together on the screen, and they're able to find a rhythm that allows them to be understated and amused even during the most alarming developments."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,75,"Alas, around about the third act, the idea grows tired and the whole thing gets derailed. Too bad, because it's a good ride until it isn't."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,75,Features some of the best fight and chase footage you'll see all summer.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"In the end, star charisma and Liman's style win us over and we relax into a sophisticated summertime diversion that is noticeably intended for adults."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"There's a car chase that's more fluid and inventive than the much-touted freeway sequence in ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" and the stars are nimble enough to make their acrobatics credible--no matter how many stunt doubles the picture employed."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"As he proved with ""The Bourne Identity,"" director Doug Liman can devise an enjoyable little action movie."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"Some people will see Mr. and Mrs. Smith as cynical, but I think its heart is deeply romantic, admittedly in an anvil-on-the-head kind of way. It's a love story not for the faint of heart. In other words, it's a lot like marriage."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"The fact that Pitt and Jolie have not been associated with this type of action is something of a help, but what was needed was the off-balance tickle that--to fantasize--Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell would have given it."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"Imagine ""The War of the Roses"" remade as a James Bond fantasy, with appropriately high-tech weaponry, and you have some idea of what Doug Liman's heavily armed comedy has in store."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"A tongue-in-cheek allegory on the hazards of harboring secrets in a relationship, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is most entertaining when the Smiths are hell-bent on mutual annihilation."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"Here is ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" inflated to lethal proportion, or ""The War of the Roses"" reimagined as World War III."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,67,"For all the nimbleness of its first half and the chemical zing of Pitt and Jolie, the film devolves into a fractious and explosive mess, hitting the same note of ''ironic'' violence over and over."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,63,Mr. & Mrs. Smith kicks off with panache and star power - and quickly wears out its welcome.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,63,"The problem with Mr. and Mrs. Smith is that it's really two movies in one. The first is a sly comedy/thriller worthy of Hitchcock, and the other is a big, noisy summer action flick."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,60,An exhaustingly elaborate romantic fantasy actioner.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,60,"If the two most gorgeous people in the world alternately bantering and making out isn't enough to compel the attention of the average American moviegoer, then we are truly doomed."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,58,"Pitt coasts through the movie in second gear. I have no idea what he's trying to accomplish with his tight-lipped, low-key performance; maybe he's angling to replace Tom Cruise in ""Mission: Impossible IV."""
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"It's a perfect role for Jolie, whose seductive looks always seem to be concealing something dangerous, even predatory, and she brings out a looseness in Pitt, who fares much better in comedic roles than when playing things straight and stoic (i.e. Troy)."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,Only Vince Vaughn registers hilariously as John's boss.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"An action comedy for suburban women that's as toothless as a newborn, and nearly as stupid. It tries so hard to be cute that it practically drools on your shoulder."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"Maybe my priorities are wrong, but this inquiring mind wants to know when these two will find a movie entirely worthy of his understatement and her naughtiness. This one has its moments, but it's also littered with action-flick junk."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"By the time the film winds itself up, the sophisticated fizz of its first 45 minutes has been smothered by explosive bombast."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"Uneven, ineffective mash-up of sex comedy and artillery-heavy action."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,Jolie has a gangly inelegance that suggests a giraffe trying to hang wallpaper -- but the entire movie is predicated on a spark between its prettier-than-thou stars that seems to have bypassed the screen and ignited in the tabloids instead.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,This romantic-comedy action movie is a fizzle.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing and occasionally incoherent action. Sometimes Mr. Pitt and Ms. Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,40,"To watch Mr. & Mrs. Smith, which continually sacrifices its potential for sophisticated fun on the altar of style and physical stunts, is to realize how far we've come from the great movies of, say, George Cukor or Howard Hawks."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,40,"The movie is a technological and publicity triumph, and a calamity in every other way."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,40,It's hard to know what these stars are ready for after this fiasco. Maybe a fitness video.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,38,A deeply stupid and offensive action comedy-romance.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,30,"The movie is a mish-mash of action-adventure clichés, book-ended with lame attempts at psychological interest. Written, directed, and acted with ham-fisted heaviness."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,25,"It may be emblematic of new-millennium Hollywood that this movie has turned out to be one more emotionless, brainless, overproduced action film."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,25,"The film is glossy, but awful. Frenetic, but awful. Expensive, but awful. ... And awful."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,80,"Unlike Burton, Schumacher doesn't let his stylistic and thematic fascinations run away with him; he keeps one hand on the wheel at all times. The result isn't as emotionally daring and visually outrageous as Burton at his best, but it's better paced and more consistently entertaining from one sequence to the next."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,75,"It's lighter, brighter, funnier, faster-paced, and a whole lot more colorful than before."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,75,"Schumacher's method is to use a lighter touch, to stay closer to the cartoon that Bob Kane created for DC Comics in 1939 and to temper Burton's nightmare world with an accessible, brightly colored TV palette."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,75,"It's an art-direction, Dolby-sound, special-effects extravaganza, a grand-scale effort that's more awe-inspiring than completely successful as entertainment."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,75,"Although the film's frenetic rhythm is reminiscent of an ""Indiana Jones"" picture, visually Schumacher directs it like a musical, turning each image into eye candy, weaving one lush set piece into the next, as if he were the Vincente Minnelli of blockbusters."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,70,"If the first two ""Batman"" movies (1989/1992) were the storm, then Batman Forever (1995) is the rainbow at the end of it. After seeing so much dark and doom, it’s also refreshing to see some beaming color."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,70,"Working as much like a circus ringmaster as a director, Joel Schumacher has brought several critical qualities to the mix, starting with much more of a pop culture sensibility and a sense of fun than Tim Burton, who directed the first two pictures, and he has a stylish visual sensibility as well."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,63,"There is no rhythm to the movie, no ebb and flow; it's all flat-out spectacle."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,63,"At best, Batman Forever is mildly diverting, brainless fun that feels like a long trailer for a better film."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,63,"Carrey lights up an otherwise over-scripted, over-frenetic potboiler."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,60,"Sometimes thrilling, but rarely inspired, it is thoroughly-almost perfectly-adequate."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,60,"Yet while Schumacher has largely accomplished the goal of delivering a cinematic comic book, he's also left the movie hollow at its core -- a distinction that may not trouble Saturday-night audiences but that nonetheless dulls the film's impact beyond its sheer and unrelenting visual grandeur."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,60,"As for the actual movie, it's the empty-calorie equivalent of a Happy Meal (another Batman tie-in), so clearly a product that the question of its cinematic merit is strictly an afterthought."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,50,"Except for the casting, it would be difficult to find any substantial difference between this movie and the previous ones, or this movie and any number of high-tech adventure movies of the last decade."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,50,"Directed by Joel Schumacher with occasional gestures toward social commentary, and enough spectacle to mask the movie's deep down emptiness."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,50,"The movie does have somewhat more lilt and levity, much of it due to Jim Carrey as the Riddler. But there's still plenty of murk, physical and metaphysical, and more psychobabble about Bruce Wayne's obsessions and repressions."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,50,"Alas, Schumacher doesn't ride on the momentum; worse, he's not an action director, and the film grinds to a dead stop every time it tries to speed up."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,50,There's so much and so little going on here simultaneously that you're not sure whether to squirm or doze.
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,40,"Director Joel Schumacher submits to the Wagnerian bombast with an overly busy surface, and the script by Lee and Janet Scott Batchler and Akiva Goldsman basically runs through the formula as if it's a checklist."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,40,"If you can see beyond the eye-scorching neon and don't mind the desecration of a superhero icon, there's a few crumbs of enjoyment to be had."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,40,"Schumacher's direction is coarse and slovenly: the picture has the self-conscious jokiness of the ""Batman"" TV series and the smudged, runny imagery of a cheaply printed comic book."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,20,The only thing Schumacher and his scrupulous craftsfolk forgot to give the movie was life -- the energizing spirit of wit and passion that makes scenes work and characters breathe.
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,100,"For dynamite suspense loaded with thrills and wicked fun, you can’t beat The Fugitive — the summer’s best action blaster."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,100,"What makes the film so special is that Ford and Tommy Lee Jones (as his chief pursuer, US Marshal Samuel Gerard) are such beautifully matched adversaries."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,100,"A tense, taut and expert thriller that becomes something more than that, an allegory about an innocent man in a world prepared to crush him."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,100,I've already seen The Fugitive twice. I'll probably see it again.
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,100,"It's as powerful as it is bruising, with more surprises than ""Jurassic Park"" and more sheer energy than any action movie this season."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,100,"The Fugitive is hardly Hitchcock — it never taps our emotions in a way that threatens to transcend the action — but it’s a mainstream thriller made with conviction, intelligence, and heat. In Hollywood, that used to be called professionalism. These days, it’s rare enough to look like artistry."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,100,"A super-adrenalized stemwinder, a crisp and jolting melodrama that screws the tension so pitilessly tight it does everything but squeak."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,91,"A consummate nail-biter that never lags, it leaves you breathless from the chase yet anxious for the next bit of mayhem or clever plot twist."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,91,"Pure energy, a perfect orchestration of heroism, villainy, suspense and comic relief."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,90,"It's a pleasure to find a thriller fulfilling its duties with such gusto: the emotions ring solid, the script finds time to relax into backchat, and for once the stunts look like acts of desperation rather than shows of prowess."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,90,"Reimagined instead of recycled, an adaptation of a '60s old TV show emerges as a first-rate thriller."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,90,"A crackling, intelligent thriller."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,90,"The film is little more than a well-oiled machine that serves a strictly limited function, but like a precision timepiece, it is a thing to marvel at, even under close scrutiny."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,90,"A flurry of stunts, close shaves and deeds of desperate daring, it easily transcends its television origins to become a stylish pacemaker-buster."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,88,The performances transform this otherwise orthodox cat-and-mouse movie into a gripping experience.
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,88,"Though it's a good half hour too long, this belated, overblown spin-off of the 60s TV show otherwise adds up to a pretty good suspense thriller."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,88,"""Innovative"" is not a legitimate description of The Fugitive, but ""entertaining"" is."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,88,The Fugitive runs hard and true the whole way through.
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,83,"Ford is up to par for the strenuous stuff, but falls short on the grief, anxiety and compassion, allowing Tommy Lee Jones to walk away with the show as the wisecracking marshal on Kimble's trail."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,80,"The action varies from a show-stopping train/bus wreck of Schwarzeneggerian proportions, to some more ironically staged pursuits which throw a welcome dash of ""Tom and Jerry"" into the mix."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,80,"As far as the chase genre goes, there have been worse films (better ones, too)."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,80,"Most big-screen adaptations of small-screen fare seek to discover some deeper - or, at least, more complex - implications of the material. But in this new Fugitive, the filmmakers have taken just the opposite approach."
The Revenant,8,183637894,100,"The Revenant is every bit as technically proficient as Inarritu's ""Birdman,"" a film that made critics swoon with its masterful handling of the filmmaker's daring ""one-take"" conceit. It manages, however, to do it without the same gimmicky feel."
The Revenant,8,183637894,100,"Boldly original, The Revenant puts everything else playing at the multiplexes in the shade."
The Revenant,8,183637894,100,"The Revenant is an action blockbuster with an art house soul, a headlong rush of motion with meaning. Pure cinema from Iñárritu and Lubezki, two undisputed masters working at their peaks."
The Revenant,8,183637894,100,"The Revenant is a visceral sensation, filled with unforgettable visuals and memorable set pieces."
The Revenant,8,183637894,100,"A riveting saga of pain, grit and the brute moral relativism of revenge, the first law of all, and the only one that mattered back then. The Revenant is one of the best pictures of the year."
The Revenant,8,183637894,100,DiCaprio’s performance is an astonishing testament to his commitment to a role.
The Revenant,8,183637894,100,"A cold, visceral, and overwhelming piece of cinema."
The Revenant,8,183637894,100,DiCaprio's raw performance helps elevate what could have been just another man-versus-nature drama.
The Revenant,8,183637894,100,"Astounding. With a director, DoP and cast at the top of their game, The Revenant is a filmmaking triumph."
The Revenant,8,183637894,100,"Pushing both brutal realism and extravagant visual poetry to the edges of what one customarily finds in mainstream American filmmaking, director/co-writer Alejandro G. Inarritu, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and a vast team of visual effects wizards have created a sensationally vivid and visceral portrait of human endurance under very nearly intolerable conditions."
The Revenant,8,183637894,100,"What is so distinctive about this Iñárritu picture is its unitary control and its fluency: no matter how extended, the film’s tense story is under the director’s complete control and he unspools great meandering, bravura travelling shots to tell it: not dissimilar, in some ways, to his previous picture, Birdman. The movie is as thrilling and painful as a sheet of ice held to the skin."
The Revenant,8,183637894,95,"Is the relentlessness too much? At two and a half hours, perhaps, but inventiveness abounds."
The Revenant,8,183637894,91,"It is as impressive as any movie released this year, but the storytelling falters in some fundamental ways that keep me from completely adoring it. Innaritu dreams big, and he has the muscle to back it up. The Revenant may not be his best film yet, but it's hard to imagine many filmmakers who are working at a higher level than he is these days."
The Revenant,8,183637894,90,"What elevates this standard, if relentless, plot line is that The Revenant feels like high-wire work without a net."
The Revenant,8,183637894,90,"If you can work up interest in such meager material, the film is a chilling, stirring, experiential immersion in what life-and-death drama might actually feel like."
The Revenant,8,183637894,88,The Revenant is exhilarating cinema.
The Revenant,8,183637894,88,"The fact that the last line of dialogue is spoken five minutes before the end credits roll is telling: Words matter little in a movie that favors seeing and feeling above all else. It’s a work of pure, furious sensation."
The Revenant,8,183637894,88,"In a year when no fewer than five films have dealt with themes of man vs. nature and survival (including The Martian, Everest, In the Heart of the Sea, and A Walk in the Woods), The Revenant is by far the most brutal, challenging, and astounding of these."
The Revenant,8,183637894,88,The Revenant is the most intense thing you’ll enjoy over the holidays this side of family dinners.
The Revenant,8,183637894,88,"You could gripe about the excess of carnage and lack of philosophical substance. But surviving nature is Iñárritu's subject, and he delivers with magisterial brilliance."
The Revenant,8,183637894,88,"Our favorite films often drop questions like these into our lives, allowing us to appreciate the world a little differently than before we saw them. The Revenant has this power. It lingers. It hangs in the back of your mind like the best classic parables of man vs. nature. It will stay there for quite some time."
The Revenant,8,183637894,83,"Though it may feel threadbare for some, Iñárritu’s near exhausting movie is still unforgettably visceral and there’s so much to be dazzled and experientially shaken by."
The Revenant,8,183637894,80,"The combined exceptional work of star Leonardo DiCaprio and nonpareil cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki create so much verisimilitude and beauty that it compels us to pay more attention to this glimpse of a dark, unsettling kill-or-be-killed world."
The Revenant,8,183637894,80,"Mr. Iñárritu isn’t content to merely seduce you with ecstatic beauty and annihilating terror; he wants to blow your mind, to amp up your art-house experience with blockbusterlike awesomeness."
The Revenant,8,183637894,80,"That grim realism sometimes makes The Revenant about as appetizing as a three-course meal of turkey jerky — but also serious enough to remind you of classics like ""Jeremiah Johnson"" and ""Little Big Man."" It's a gruesome adventure story that rarely lets up."
The Revenant,8,183637894,80,"While the style may outpace the substance, that doesn't make the style any less magnificent. And when it comes to sheer customer satisfaction, The Revenant checks nearly every box, up to and including the man vs. wild throwdown. It just makes a jarring, memorable statement about how often the wild is likely to win that uneven fight."
The Revenant,8,183637894,80,"I’m not sure The Revenant is quite as tough and uncompromising as it thinks it is: it's coffee-table existentialism, with psychological brush-strokes so thick they might as well have been put on with a mop. But there’s no question it’s an extraordinary, blood-summoning, sinew-stiffening ride."
The Revenant,8,183637894,80,"This brutal survival tale is so powerfully engrossing that, despite the clear limitations of his monochromatic, showy approach, the film’s compelling construction tends to override the legitimate criticisms."
The Revenant,8,183637894,80,"What makes this more than just a punishing, fearful, expertly crafted thriller focused on one man’s endurance is heavily down to Emmanuel Lubezki’s attractive, thoughtful photography."
The Revenant,8,183637894,78,"The most punishing movie of 2015, The Revenant, is almost as brutal an experience for the viewer to watch as it is for its title character Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) to undergo. That’s not meant as a knock, but rather as a warning that the film may leave you as near-speechless and mono-minded as its battered returnee from the dead."
The Revenant,8,183637894,75,Iñárritu has his eye so firmly on the myths of America that he loses sight of the men who made them. But he’s hardly the first person to do that.
The Revenant,8,183637894,75,"I might be tempted to vote DiCaprio best actor — or at least to propose a new category be inaugurated, the acting equivalent of the Purple Heart."
The Revenant,8,183637894,75,"A film I admired, but didn’t especially like, The Revenant is a master class in craftsmanship, marrying the ethos of 1970s Hollywood, with its beaten-dog heroes forever roughed up by a brutal system, to the technological prowess of today’s digitally obsessed blockbusters."
The Revenant,8,183637894,75,"There’s a sense that the whole doesn’t quite equal the sum of the parts, no matter how spectacular some of them are."
The Revenant,8,183637894,75,"Gorgeously shot by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, Iñárritu’s savage endurance test of a film almost works better as a series of stunning images and surreal sequences than as an emotionally satisfying story."
The Revenant,8,183637894,75,No amount of ingenious camerawork and breakneck pacing can obscure a simplistic core.
The Revenant,8,183637894,70,"Its scale and ambition at times makes it seem like more than it is: a survival story. There’s nothing wrong with that, and it’s a good one. It’s just not a whole lot more."
The Revenant,8,183637894,70,"The hitch with tales of endurance, onscreen, is their unfortunate habit of becoming endurance tests for the viewer, and, after a while, The Revenant turns into a slog. Make no mistake, it’s a very beautiful slog. Emmanuel Lubezki’s cinematography summons a wealth of wonders."
The Revenant,8,183637894,70,"The Revenant is supposed to be relentless, though you may find it tiresome, the movie equivalent of tigers circling a tree so single-mindedly that they churn themselves into butter."
The Revenant,8,183637894,67,"What The Revenant attempts but fails to do is create a larger vision from all this survivalist mayhem. It’s a useful how-to guide for how to stay alive after a bear attack – or a human attack, for that matter – but it doesn’t soar. It crawls."
The Revenant,8,183637894,63,"That first hour is big, and imposing. The rest grows smaller, with the script's self-conscious deeper meanings either layered on top, like pelts, or — more successfully — left to Luzbeki's meticulous images of a sun-dappled 19th century Eden now home to one too many Wal-Mart stores."
The Revenant,8,183637894,60,Though there's an awful lot to be admired - not least an enormously impressive soundscape - The Revenant ultimately lacks the nerve-jangling thrills or the spiritual resonance that it strives for.
The Revenant,8,183637894,60,"I think The Revenant is, on the whole, pain without gain, but it’s certainly a tour ​de force — literally, a feat of strength."
The Revenant,8,183637894,60,"In aiming to steer his dark, fatalistic vision toward something genuinely contemplative and cathartic, Inarritu has managed to appropriate the beauty of Malick’s filmmaking but none of its sublimity — another word for which might be humility. There is plenty of amazement here, to be sure, but all too little in the way of grace."
The Revenant,8,183637894,50,"However good DiCaprio may be, everything else feels overblown."
The Revenant,8,183637894,50,"Despite the literal and figurative pains it takes to persuade viewers of its own importance, The Revenant can’t escape the clutches of crippling self-regard."
The Revenant,8,183637894,50,If Iñárritu wanted to show how life on the frontier was miserable and monotonous he succeeded — by making a movie that is miserable and monotonous. Some of the greatest cinematography in history can’t change that fact.
The Revenant,8,183637894,40,"I came out of this would-be epic feeling physically exhausted, psychically mauled and none the better for wear."
The Revenant,8,183637894,40,"For a while, at least, this one feels like Iñárritu’s masterpiece, until that familiar too-muchness begins to take over."
The Revenant,8,183637894,38,"What pushes the film, at long last, into the icy river, is its very design, as a monument to slick, mercenary grandeur."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,100,"This is one perfectly terrifying movie, an instant classic."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,89,"Nearly a perfect film, from its bold and epic man-vs.-nature conflict to the breathless scripting, editing, acting, and direction."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,88,'Titanic'' was a case of a cheeseball story riding terrific effects. The Perfect Storm is in every important way deeper.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,88,"Accomplishes a delicate balancing act, that of entertaining the audience with the thrills and adventure of the Andrea Gail's final journey."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,88,A well-crafted example of a film of pure sensation. I do not mind admitting I was enthralled.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,80,"As a movie, this is exciting stuff."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,80,Scary and exciting.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,75,"Dive right in if you're looking for an old-fashioned entertainment that delivers corny romance, turbulent action, and enough wave-churning seascapes to make ""Titanic"" seem landlocked."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,75,"The problem with The Perfect Storm is that while its roiling collision of weather systems is pulled off with cinematic deftness, the actors who stand there getting lashed and splashed don't have anything terribly interesting to say."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,75,"Does about as good a job of simulating that terror as it possibly could, but it's no competition for what we create in our mind's eye while reading."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,75,Unabashedly designed to blow its audience away.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,75,Petersen's speculative reenactment makes for gripping summer entertainment -- if you don't mind a little corn floating in your brine.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,70,"Impersonal Hollywood filmmaking at its most paradoxical. It keeps you glued to your seat, and leaves no aftertaste whatsoever."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,70,"Has noticeable problems with characterization and dialogue. But once that awesome storm, one of the most terrifying ever put on film, gets cranked up, it's hard to remember what those difficulties were, let alone care too much about them."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,67,"The stick-figure people in the script haven't the slightest chance of making an impression, and you're more excited at the prospect of the next big wave?"
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,65,"The perfect example, of how the newest visual effects movies have the capacity to overwhelm everything--from actors to plotlines--except in the end, maybe, their audiences."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,63,"By the end, I felt like a beetle going round and round in a toilet bowl that just wouldn't stop flushing."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,63,So much water. Such a dramatic washout.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,63,"The movie is ""Twister"" on the high seas, a spectacular-looking, spectacularly hollow tale about foolhardy men vs. imperious nature."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,63,An enthralling special-effects tour de force with a lover's nook.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,60,The storm is the reason to see the movie.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,60,"Overall, the book is a far more rewarding experience than the movie."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,58,"Petersen gives us monumental images of waves and rain and wind, but the editing is so choppy that the images don't build and crest."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"But jaw-dropping trailer aside, there isn't much movie here."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,Rains on its own parade.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"Not terrible, but distinctly disappointing, not nearly as engaging or thrilling as its premise seems to promise."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"The Perfect Storm is no ""Titanic."""
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"The yarn's emotional undercurrents never take hold, resulting in a picture that leaves one thinking less about the fates of the characters than about how the actors had to spend most of their working days soaking wet."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"What's true about The Perfect Storm is true of many effects epics: it's not a bad movie, except for the people."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,Big effects; threadbare story.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"Once at sea, The Perfect Storm collapses in a heap of spectacle and a dubious piling-on of scary incidents."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,40,"The whole thing is kitsch of the most pricey sort, and it's a good guess that it will be a smash."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,40,"It may have been the perfect storm, but this is the imperfect movie."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,40,"Its spectacular special effects threaten to swallow characters whole, and there are times when overwrought and clumsy dialogue... nearly pitch you right out of the movie's mood."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,40,It's like a memorial service with killer special effects.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,75,Fast and funny and brings back some of the wonder to the series.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,70,"Definitely still beating a dead dinosaur here, but the film is leaner, more exciting and superior in every way to the last outing."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,67,Another of many recent Hollywood plotless wonders.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,63,What makes it worth sitting through is the chance it offers to catch up on the technical advances since the last installment.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,63,"Despite all its talk of genetic engineering and its deliberately stupid characters, the unintended message of Jurassic Park III is that when it comes to art and entertainment, you can't beat human DNA."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,63,"Anything, Steven, anything would be better than making us watch the same movie again."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,63,"Isn't terribly frightening or gory, and at times it's even atmospheric. It also has a sense of humor, and the digs at the prequels hit pay dirt."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,60,The sheer physical presence of these creatures is much more believable and convincing than what can be generously characterized as the film's plot.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,60,"At its best, Jurassic Park III is eerily similar to some of the more recent dinosaur-themed video games on the market."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,60,"Has no pretentions to be anything more than a goose-bumpy fantasy theme-park ride for kids, but it's such a routine ride."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,50,"While kids of all ages will want to see it, the movie is loud and occasionally brutal, and while the body count is relatively low, it's still pretty scary stuff."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,50,"The whole enterprise sags and wheezes like the tired, we're-in-this-strictly-for-the-money sequel it really is."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,50,"This is a monster movie -- 92 minutes, lots of action, lots of green legs stomping, get in, get out."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,50,"The screenplay is so stale that even fans of the previous ""Jurassic"" installments might think this is one clone too many."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,50,"Maybe if you're younger than 10 you'll be scared or thrilled by this film. Otherwise, be prepared for one of the most unexciting pictures this summer."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,50,"The story's tired, as are the main characters."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,42,"When a cell-phone gag is the most exciting or inventive thing in a big summer dinosaur movie, you have to wonder if the species might not be ready for extinction."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,40,"All it wants to do is scare a smile onto your face, and it often succeeds. After all, how can a movie that offers Michael Jeter as a mercenary not be fun?"
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,40,More of the same -- only less so.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,40,"With Joe Johnston directing instead of Spielberg, who executive-produces, and a scrum of screenwriters, none named Crichton, the franchise suffers some negligence."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,40,"Has to be the sorriest excuse for a reprise since ""Highlander — The Final Dimension."""
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,40,Even the special effects alone aren't worth the price of admission.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,40,Game ride that makes the two previous installments look like models of classic filmmaking.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,38,"The ""Jurassic Park"" movie franchise does not evolve. Quite the opposite: It degenerates at great speed."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,38,Drama is minimal and character nonexistent.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,30,A serious been-there-done-that number.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,25,"Stinks worse than dino dung. Sure, the creatures look good."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,100,Enormous fun.
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,100,"Director Brian De Palma is having too much fun zipping around curves and hitting the accelerator to slow down. He's a supremely confident engineer, and if you're game enough to make a jump for it and hold on, he offers the giddy excitement of watching the ground rush by beneath your dangling feet."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,90,"Exciting, smart and enormously enjoyable."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,90,"A sleek, whooshingly entertaining update of the vintage television series."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,80,"The bottom line on a film like this is, Tom Cruise looks cool and holds our attention while doing neat things that we don't quite understand--doing them so quickly and with so much style that we put our questions on hold, and go with the flow."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,75,"It's a movie of profoundly convoluted pop pleasures. Between dazzling suspense sequences, it invites the audience to work for a good time."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,75,"Unlike most action films, Mission: Impossible's distinct appeal operates not so much on suspense but on improbability."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,75,"All Mission Impossible had to do was not self-destruct. Mission accomplished. Does it ignite? Not really, but Tom Cruise's first adventure as a producer has just enough hightech firepower, old-fashioned star power and a director who knows how to harness it all."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,75,"This movie isn't a disaster, but, all things considered, there's little reason to make it a high priority for theatrical viewing."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,75,Holes in the script cause the narrative to burp at times.
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,70,"Mission: Impossible proves something of a letdown, not just because it's fairly easy to guess who the bad guy is but also because we've hardly gotten to know anyone in the movie well enough to become more than superficially involved with them."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,63,"Whatever the reason for its disappointments, Mission: Impossible is a mission gone awry, prompting you to hope that reruns of its television incarnation will pop up on cable soon."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,63,"Some of the suspense set-pieces are impressive, but the picture would pack a greater wallop if it were stitched together more tightly and consistently."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,63,"The result is a gracefully plotted spy film in the classic mode, with just enough self-consciousness to keep things interesting."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,63,"The movie comes alive in bursts such as a train-top fight hampered by gale-force winds. Cruise's star wattage may hog the show, but it insures that Mission: Impossible won't self-destruct easily."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,63,Every effect is so calculated that only the conscious minds of filmmakers and viewers are engaged--and not by very much or for very long.
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,60,"Humorless, charmless and flat."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,60,"It's the worst kind of convoluted thriller -- it can never unravel satisfactorily because there's nothing simple at its center, just more confusion."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,100,"This movie is one of the most relentlessly nonstop action pictures ever made, with a virtuoso series of climactic sequences that must last an hour and never stop for a second. It's a roller-coaster ride, a visual extravaganza, a technical triumph, and a whole lot of fun."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,80,"The sustained furore of humour, visual panache and headlong momentum makes for dazzling cinema."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,80,"All in all, Spielberg has come up with another rousing piece of entertainment."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,75,"Temple of Doom doesn't so much pay tribute to the serial adventures of yore as it does embody them. Here, frivolity and evil blithely coexist—and women are a lot more likely to scream than win drinking contests."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,70,The new film is more an embellishment than an improvement on the snazzy Raiders.
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,63,"Indy's companions are weak; we don't identify with them the way we did with Marion and Sallah. There's less action and more overt comedy, and neither change works to the benefit of the story."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,63,"Watching it is like spending a day at an amusement park, which is probably what Mr. Spielberg and his associates intended. It moves tirelessly from one ride or attraction to the next, only occasionally taking a minute out for a hot dog, and then going right on to the next unspeakable experience."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,60,"The nonstop pace may eventually numb viewers to the thrills, although Spielberg must be congratulated for adding some shades of character to his archetypal action hero this time
around."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,60,"It has more complex stunts, more technical perfection, and more than a touch of genius. It's fun at both ends. But it's also mean-spirited and corrupt at its core."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,50,"Moviegoers deserve more than the racism, sexism, and all-purpose mayhem on view here - failings that offset the razor-sharp action and technical brilliance also visible."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,50,Spielberg is such a talented director it’s a shame to see him lose all sense of subtlety and nuance.
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,80,"Top Gun is not so much a movie in the conventional sense as an escalating series of masterfully crafted adverts: motorcycles, aircraft carriers, pectorals and planes all look as if they’ve been shot for a particularly luminous beer campaign."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,80,"Set in the world of naval fighter pilots, pic has strong visuals and pretty young people in stylish clothes and a non-stop soundtrack."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,75,Top Gun has always been more than just an action flick about a cocky young fighter pilot who feels the need for speed.
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,75,"No doubt about it: Top Gun is going to be the hit that ""The Right Stuff"" should have been. They are not in the same class of films, but this much must be said: The aerial sequences in Top Gun are as thrilling -- while remaining coherent -- as any ever put on film."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,63,"This is a movie that comes in two parts: It knows exactly what to do with special effects, but doesn't have a clue as to how two people in love might act and talk and think."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,63,"The flight sequences in “Top Gun” may arouse aerial buffs. Still, this movie approaches its subject in such juvenile, superficial way that it’s clear the producers were merely in a hurry to cash in on Hollywood’s new wave of Rambo-style patriotism."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,60,"The excitement is switched off on landing. Once Top Gun, which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters, gets back to earth, the master of the skies is as clunky as a big land-bound bird."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,50,"What TOP GUN contributes to the genre is an increased emphasis on military hardware and an almost homoerotic attraction for male bodies, mostly sweaty ones."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,50,"Top Gun is about the training of the Navy's best fighter pilots and their blooding in cold war incidents, and the only thing Director Tony Scott has not brought up to date is the story. It is the one about the hotdog who has to be taught to be a team player. They were peddling that one before Writers Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. were born."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,50,"Every moment is hyped for maximum visual and visceral impact, but Scott doesn't display the slightest bit of interest (or belief) in the actual characters and situations."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,91,"MIB3 is one giant leap for mankind because Josh Brolin shows up to play the younger Agent K. And he just nails the feat, triumphantly creating a riff on/homage to the Tommy Lee Jones-ness of K that goes much deeper (and funnier) than a simple imitation of drawl and speech patterns."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,80,"It manages, in the end, to be touching as well as hectic and whimsical, and to send a few interesting thematic bubbles into the air, having to do with lost fathers, obscure regrets and racial reconciliation."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,80,"Finding smart ways to bring novelty to the franchise without forsaking what made the original so much fun (and in fact doubling down on some of those qualities), Barry Sonnenfeld's Men in Black 3 easily erases the second installment's vague but unpleasant memory and -- though we might hope producers will quit while they're ahead -- paves the way for future installments."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,80,"You do sense, though, that the people behind MIB3 (mainly veteran producer Walter F. Parkes and script doctor David Koepp) were smart enough to let the audience grow up a bit, enough to get the Andy Warhol jokes and one brilliantly weird creation, a delicate alien who can see every outcome at once."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,75,The aliens are as gloppy and gross as ever. I especially liked the joke about Andy Warhol being an alien – except didn't we know that already?
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,75,"While this third go-round may not seem necessary amid summer's blockbusters, it's an entertaining jaunt back in time with the likably mismatched duo."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,75,"If you're looking for cinema verite, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a fun, fizzy sequel in a franchise left for dead 10 years ago, have at it."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,75,"So did the world need another ""Men in Black""?  No, not at all.  But if there had to be one, then it's certainly a relief that it should be one as agreeable as this."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,75,"Delight, a modest yet palpable measure of the stuff, is restored."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,75,The film is largely redeemed by an unexpected emotional resonance befitting a Steven Spielberg production.
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,75,"Although I liked the first ""MiB"" movie, I wasn't particularly looking forward to this belated sequel. But I had fun. It has an ingenious plot, bizarre monsters, audacious cliff-hanging, and you know what? A closing scene that adds a new and sort of touching dimension to the characters of J and K."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,70,"Sonnenfeld's best movies function like elaborate Rube Goldberg contraptions, with visual gags popping out on a precise calibration of gears and springs, and Cohen's script, however derivative, is a stable apparatus."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,70,Good trippy fun.
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,70,It's clear the filmmakers aren't simply expecting to coast on audience goodwill...Men in Black 3 is at its best when it simply owns its own absurdity.
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,63,"It's a brisk but restful breeze blowing through our heads, requiring no thought whatsoever – in fact, thoughts are an impediment to enjoying it – and touching us just a bit in unexpected ways."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,63,"The effects are cheese-whizzy fun, but it's the unexpected spark between Smith and Brolin that makes MiB3 primo summer fun. Way cool."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,63,"It still has cool creatures and 1960s set design, and the 3-D is the best of the season, but if you try to remember the story or jokes, you'll find that you've been hit by a neuralyzer beam."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,63,"Brolin's performance is funny, masterful, confident, and more than a little unsettling. If one human being can sample another, that's what's going on here. The rest of Men in Black 3 is about as good as one could hope for from an unnecessary sequel that's a decade late to the party."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,63,This only mildly bloated and convoluted action comedy has enough inspired moments to wipe out memories of the abysmal 2002 first sequel as surely as one of the black-suited heroes' neutralizer.
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,60,"Most wonderful of all is Josh Brolin as the young Agent K. It's so easy to believe that Brolin could turn into Jones, given a couple of decades."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,60,"The comedy sci-fi franchise returns after a ten-year hiatus, with the same formula of respectably funny wisecracks and obsessively detailed space monsters."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,60,"It's by no means a triumph, but one of the enjoyable things about Men in Black has always been the malleable nature of its reality."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,60,"A solidly entertaining summer movie is always welcome, even if it can't quite claim to be out of this world."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,60,"The good news is that it's better than the second ""Men in Black."" The bad news is: not all that much. There are a couple of clever ideas, a few funny moments, a wealth of computer-generated special effects. But it's hollow at its core, and the asides have lost some of their spark."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,60,Men in Black 3 is exactly what you'd expect: amiable mediocrity and nicely laid-back performances with pricy special effects plugging in the gaps where jokes should be.
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,58,"If this movie truly cost $375 million to produce and market (as the L.A. Times reported), the biggest chunk isn't on the screen."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,50,"What we're left with is a thoroughly mediocre, shrug-generating disappointment -- and one that certainly doesn't feel like it should have cost more than a third of a billion dollars to make and market."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,50,"The finished product is in a different league than the whompingly terrible Men in Black II - it hits its marks. But it's not inventive enough to overcome the overarching inertia, the palpable absence of passion."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,50,"The younger man's personality is all the more startling for the skill and generosity with which Mr. Brolin creates a persuasively vital K while foreshadowing the grump to come. The script explains the change in elaborate detail, but the performance defies explanation; it's mysteriously marvelous."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,50,More like an attempt to reenergize a franchise than rebottle the lightning that electrified the original.
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,40,"Despite such ubiquitous timidity, one can pluck out a few pleasing distractions here."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,40,"In a summer hardly starved of comic-book properties, this redundant extension of a series that ran out of gas a decade ago doesn't need a neuralyzer to be forgettable."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,40,"Despite some good moments, Agents J, O and K are missing an E."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,38,"This third outing climaxes with a dark and melodramatic twist that, while adding a layer of nuance and back story that the previous two films never had, also feels wildly out of sync with its audience's expectations."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,38,"Those who don't understand what it means for an actor to ""sleepwalk"" through a performance need only watch Men in Black III; there's no shortage of examples."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,30,"So creaky and out of touch it inspires pity. Its opening sequences are a near marvel of confusion, mayhem and embarrassments for its actors. If it was a person, you'd worry it had dementia."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,30,"Less extraordinary and considerably more banal, given the sci-fi/comedy subject matter, is Men in Black 3's story, which jumps the ectomorphic shark in high style but with a deficit of actual belly laughs."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,25,"Men in Black 3 is so dull and empty, it's the first movie that has ever made me think ""Thank God this is in 3D."""
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,100,"It’s not about the world catching up to understand poor, lonesome Hiccup. It’s about Hiccup catching up to the expectations of the world on his own."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,100,"Gleeful and smart, funny and serious, this sequel surpasses the endearing original with gorgeous animation — a dragon Eden, a dragon scourge, an infinitude of dragons — and one stirring human encounter after another."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,100,"Not only does this second movie match the charm, wit, animation skill and intelligent storytelling of the original, I think it even exceeds it."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,100,"This is a sequel that has its own story to tell and that gets right down to it, and it expands on the ideas from the first film, but in a way that tells a thematically satisfying and complete story. In other words, this is how franchises are supposed to work."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,90,"If necessity is the mother of invention, then DreamWorks’ desire to extend the Dragon franchise has propelled the creative team in the most admirable of directions, resulting in what just may be the mother of all animated sequels."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,88,"One of this year's true surprises, the superior animated sequel not only is infused with the same independent spirit and off-kilter aesthetic that enriched the original, it also deepens the first film's major themes."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,88,"A riveting, moving and beautifully animated film."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,88,"If anyone is concerned about the way women are presented on the big screen these days, just look at how an evolved male like Hiccup respectfully treats his girlfriend Astrid (America Ferrera) and the portrayal of Blanchett’s Valka."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,88,"It's thrilling, a soaring blend of 3D animation and spectacular storytelling that swerves daringly to honor the healing chaos of family, human and dragon."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,88,The movie offers just the right amount of spectacle.
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,88,"Looks, feels and flows like a real movie. It's better than the last few Pixar features, among other things, and from where I sit that includes ""Toy Story 3."""
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,85,"Director Dean DeBlois has been saying this installment is the middle movie in a How to Train Your Dragon trilogy. It's clear that he took inspiration from the first Star Wars trilogy — not a bad model for breathing new life, and yes, a bit of fire, into one of Hollywood's more nuanced animated franchises."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,83,"How to Train Your Dragon 2 is how to make a sequel, when it gets its head out of the clouds."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,80,"At times terrifying and too tough for tinies, this is nevertheless a triumphant sequel that puts its faith in Hiccup and Toothless to find a way through dark times for man and dragon. Until we all get our own dragon to go flying with, the result is a story sufficiently thrilling to have us all airborne."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,80,"What DeBlois has deepened in No. 2, is the film's emotional core. Though there are moments when the tension goes slack, the cast steps up to keep things afloat."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,80,"The rote hero/villain face-offs are exciting, but the film is in no hurry to fast-forward to them. DeBlois seems to have a real passion for this world, and like Hiccup, he seems much more interested in soaring through the clouds than in fighting on the ground."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,80,"The look of the film is amazing. The animation, particularly when the dragons take flight, is seamless."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,78,"I laughed, I cried, I longed for a pet dragon to call my own."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,75,Visually interesting but offers nothing groundbreaking. The animation is competent but not overwhelming. There's no moment of wonderment.
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,75,"Like its 2010 predecessor, it's one of the most gorgeous computer-animated kids' films you'll come across, and one of the few that uses 3-D smartly and effectively."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,75,It is by far the sharpest-looking DreamWorks Animation film to date.
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,75,"Thankfully, all of the voice actors from the original return, including Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill and Craig Ferguson, and keep lightening the mood."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,75,"Offers some stunningly beautiful sequences and an engaging, if at times quite dark, story line."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,75,"While the original movie benefited from narrative simplicity and an admirable lack of villains, this one paints the screen with too many characters and frequent diversions from the main story, but nevertheless serves up a bountiful and sugary feast for the 3-D-bespectacled eyes."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,70,Dragon 2 is at its best when it quiets down and dares to be intimate.
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,70,"Dragon 2 is considerably darker and more self-aware than its forerunner. Both films are speedier than the average animated blockbuster. In places, Dragon 2 is almost too fast to keep up with, and, in other places, it’s a little too dark, at least in 3-D."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,70,"The plot is needlessly busy, and much of the action is more manic and indistinct. But How to Train Your Dragon 2 cuts deeper than the first picture — it will be particularly resonant for anyone who has ever worked with or adopted rescue animals — and there are a few sequences of cartoon grandeur."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,70,"Clearly, these films are the work of people who love animals. More importantly though, going beyond the pat eco-conscious message that every kids’ film has to have, HTTYD2 touches on how complex the emotional bond between a person and an animal can be."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,67,"There aren’t just more dragons, but more characters, more plot, more everything. The trade-off is that the charm of the original gets a little lost, a casualty of rapid-franchise expansion."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,67,"After meandering for a while, the story kicks into gear in the third act, with a couple of legitimately shocking and well-executed developments that do pack a punch missing elsewhere in the film."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,63,"How to Train Your Dragon 2 recaptures those lyrical highs. But returning writer-director Dean DeBlois also aims to layer on more poignancy for Baruchel and his castmates to play. At points, we’re left feeling a little detached."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,63,"A cartoon with better animation and livelier action, if fewer jokes. If there’s one thing these sweet-message/great flying sequence movies don’t need is fewer jokes."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,60,Hats off to Dreamworks for offering some bold surprises in a respectable sequel filled with moments of humour and emotion among its ample noise and movement.
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,60,"Younger kids looking for the cute connection between hesitant teen Hiccup and his loyal dragon, Toothless, may be stunned by the film’s violent tone. At the same time, it’s the unflinching edge that gives the film its unexpected depth."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,60,"This is a more rugged affair than, say, ""Frozen,"" and any admirers of that film might find themselves yearning for a few more songs and a little less testosterone."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,60,"If there isn't enough to feel, at least there's a lot to look at. Thanks to the superb 3-D direction by DeBlois, we swoop through the air, whoosh down dragons’ tails, and juuust baaaarely squeeze into small crevices, but still, those experiences are only like being on a really great rollercoaster — they don't mean anything."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,60,"The action sequences here are armrest-gripping fun, and you only wish DeBlois and his animators had been even more confident; held their shots even longer; allowed us to enjoy the whistle of the wind and the curve of the dragons’ flight paths without hurriedly cutting away to another angle, and another, and another. When the film flies, it soars."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,50,"It has the core of a genuine crowd-pleaser, but unfortunately something bigger and more all-consuming keeps getting into its head."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,50,What's unfortunate is that Toothless is starring in a toothless story.
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,100,"As both a simian simile and a wonder of technology, Rise of the Planet of the Apes deserves to be in the company of the great original ""Kong."" This year's sixth ""origins"" story of a fantasy franchise (after The Green Hornet, Thor, X-Men: First Class, Green Lantern and Captain America: The First Avenger) is also the year's finest action movie."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,100,This summer's best popcorn flick.
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,90,"Smart, fun and thoroughly enjoyable, it's a model summer diversion that entertains without insulting your intelligence."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,90,"Judged, though, as the action extravaganza it means to be, Rise of the Planet of the Apes wins high marks for originality, and takes top honors for spectacle."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,88,"Audacious, violent and disquieting, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a summer sequel that's better than it has any right to be."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,83,"It's the rest of the movie, especially a grin-inducing final third, which makes ""Apes"" rise above the level of a typical sci-fi rehash."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,80,"By far the best spectacle movie of the season, and one of the few films to use digital technology for nuanced dramatic effect."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,80,"A worthy, exciting, emotional addition to the venerable monkey movie marathon. Apes will rise. Sequels are likely."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,80,"As tight as the parallel homo sapiens storylines are lax, Caesar's prison conversion to charismatic pan-ape revolutionist is near-silent filmmaking, with simple and precise images illustrating Caesar's General-like divining of personalities and his organization of a group from chaos to order. All of this is shown in absorbing, propulsive style, as Caesar broodingly bides his time like a king in disguise awaiting restoration."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,80,Whereas the original was a work of speculative science fiction - a chin-stroking fable about evolution in the nuclear age - this revisiting of the Planet of the Apes myth is an animal-rights manifesto disguised as a prison-break movie.
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,80,"Strong action, special effects and by far the most credible ape ""performances"" yet seen will spell box office to inspire chest-thumping in all markets."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,"It's faint praise to say that this is the best of the ""Planet of the Apes"" movies, because the evolution of special effects and makeup was predictable. But the unexpected strength of the film is its heart."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,"The running time is efficient, the direction is clean, the story is simple but resonant, the effects are understated yet impressive, and the near-wordless star of the show puts on an acting clinic. Damned if the risen one doesn't lift us out of our seats."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,"The cautionary tale feels surprisingly fresh and entertaining, given that this is the fifth ""Planet of the Apes"" film since the 1968 original."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,"The movie rises and, at times, even soars. This is all - and I do mean all - thanks to what human actors in league with computer technology can now achieve to bring the apes to life. No more guys squeezed into monkey suits and talking in posh accents. Performance-capture makes all the difference."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,"Rise is very consciously a drama about a Simian Spring, and it's close enough in its details to a recent documentary to be thought of as ""Project Nim: The Revenge."""
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,A shamelessly fun B-movie with A-movie effects.
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,"While it's effects-heavy, the movie itself does not feel heavy. Consider it a fanciful extension of the recent and very fine documentary ""Project Nim."""
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,Wyatt brings a light touch to the potentially grim material - too light when it drops in some groan-inducing references to the original film - but he keeps the action compelling whether focusing on apes as they run amok or as they quietly contemplate their next move.
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,"The movie has its pleasures, although human intelligence is not one of them. Caesar, to begin with, is a wonderfully executed character, a product of special effects and a motion-capture performance by Andy Serkis, who earlier gave us Gollum in ""Lord of the Rings."""
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,70,"It's good, canny-dumb fun."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,70,"Compared to this summer's grab bag of superheros vying for a franchise, the apes rise (pardon the pun) to the challenge of making us care."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,70,I kind of enjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes despite its evident silliness and the fact that nobody's likely to remember it three weeks from now.
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,70,"Thanks to stunning advances in performance capture technology, director Rupert Wyatt successfully ditches the cumbersome makeup appliances of past chapters, building the story around a cast of photoreal CG simians convincing enough to identify with as characters, rather than just special effects."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,70,"Once you see that ape, named Caesar, riding a galloping horse in triumph, it's awfully hard not to get sucked in. It's not dumb fun, exactly. It's smart dumb fun."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,67,"The movie is zippier than Tim Burton's oddly lifeless 2001 ""Planet of the Apes"" remake, but unlike good sci-fi, it doesn't signify anything, or really even try to."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,63,The central problem with Rise of the Planet of the Apes is that it feels more like a piece of something larger than a complete motion picture.
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,60,"To showcase the special effects, the filmmakers reportedly trimmed many of the dialogue-based scenes, thereby dulling the dramatic impact of a strong genre premise."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,60,"The middle section of the story is where Rise truly takes off, perhaps in ways that will have viewers forgiving the rest."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,60,"Evincing more visible intelligence than any of his human co-stars aside from Lithgow, Caesar is disquietingly lifelike."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,58,"Feels like half of a good movie, much of it revealed in admittedly thrilling trailers."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,50,"They probably should have called it ""Beneath the Dignity of the Planet of the Apes,"" but Rise of the Planet of the Apes is tolerable if you'll just keep in mind that the original feature was an overachieving B-movie."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,50,"It is not what could be fairly called a bad movie, but neither is it fine enough to be a good one, with its lineup of dull characters and a limp story that functions like a conveyor belt."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,50,"Now for the bad news. The filmmakers seem to have spent so much attention and, presumably, money on getting the primates right that they completely forgot about the people."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,50,"Like the film that constrains him, a prequel to Planet of the Apes, perhaps James Franco understands his performance as something that will one day evolve into something far greater."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,50,"James Franco looks more bored and distracted in Rise of the Planet of the Apes than he did when he was hosting the Oscars: Watching the movie, I kept waiting for him to pull out his iPhone, aim it at the camera and take a snapshot while mugging sheepishly. Has there ever been a film with a less engaged protagonist?"
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,45,"Too earnest and dour to be a silly bit of summer fun, but it's not exactly scientifically sound, either."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,42,"Since the only really good ""Planet of the Apes"" movie was the 1968 original with Charlton Heston, I've always wondered why filmmakers can't just leave well enough alone."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,40,"Hell, even Heston's performance elicited cheers back in the day. Franco, in a totally, tonally different role, but still the prime human here, is a pale shadow of the ruined future to come."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,100,"Captain America: The First Avenger is one of the finest movies yet from Marvel Studios, and a big departure in tone and storytelling from most of the films they've made so far.  It is a strong indicator that the more willing the studio is to experiment, the more exciting the payoffs can be."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,91,"Johnston and company are aware that introducing a hero means more than showing off his suit and gadgets or building up the universe he will eventually encapsulate. Before any of that, we must care about who he/she is."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,91,It gives you all that you could ask for when you buy a ticket to a thrill ride.
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,88,"The movie surges ahead, moving nimbly through a series of action set-pieces that owe more to films like ""Where Eagles Dare"" and ""The Guns of Navarone"" than they do to, say, ""The Green Hornet."""
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,88,Adding goofy uncertainty to shoulders as wide as the East River makes for a disarming hero in one of the spiffiest WWII action yarns ever to march out of Hollywood.
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,88,"The best kind of comic-book movie. It's stylish and spectacular, yet it's rooted in history and human emotions. It's smart yet it's funny. It's wise yet it kicks ass when it has to. Just like the U.S. of A."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,88,"The most stylish comics-derived entertainment of the year...It's paced and designed for people who won't shrivel up and die if two or three characters take 45 seconds between combat sequences to have a conversation about world domination, or a dame."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,80,"Joe Johnston - returning to the vibe of his first directorial effort, ""The Rocketeer"" (1991) - creates a fun retro-futurist environment with a World War II setting, and he has the discernment not to let the effects overwhelm the story."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,80,"Captain America isn't a masterpiece, but it's a solidly crafted, elegant adventure movie that held my attention from start to finish and sent me out into the street energized instead of enervated."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,80,"This muscular, red-blooded adventure has a decent heart and the stuff of Saturday afternoon serials running through its veins."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,80,"Captain America is exactly what the third week of July needed: a curiously fun, surprisingly imaginative and unashamedly old-fashioned yarn of skulduggery and adventure."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,80,"What really distinguishes Captain from the other superhero movies of 2011 (and quite frankly, the majority of the others released in the last several years) is a romance that feels like an integral - not incidental - component of the plot."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"What distinguishes Cap is his humble backstory, which involves neither hairy gods nor hot-dogging test pilots but a kid from Brooklyn who just wants to fight for freedom."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"While the story is preposterous and most of the cast standard-issue, it's hard not to like a comic-book movie that features both Busby Berkeley-style dance numbers and high-tech vaporizing weaponry."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"For the most part, it manages to balance laughs, genuinely rousing moments, and a fully packed agenda into something fleet enough to keep running under the weight of its rich ambitions."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"Captain America might hold the most promise, not just of saving the world, but of saving comic book movies from themselves."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"Succeeds where ""Thor"" didn't and the ""Incredible Hulk"" hasn't, twice. Unlike those drags, director Joe Johnston keeps things relatively simple and pleasantly stupid."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,It goes without saying it's preposterous. But it has the texture and takes the care to be a full-blown film.
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"Stolidly corny, old-fashioned pulp fun."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"The fourth comic book movie of the summer is the best comic book movie of the summer. Johnston has delivered a light, clever and deftly balanced adventure picture with real lump in the throat nostalgia."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,70,"Until the computer-generated effects bog it down and mess up its rhythms, Captain America: The First Avenger, has a measured, classical pace and a lot of good, old-fashioned craftsmanship."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,70,"On its own, Captain America is a modestly engaging little-big movie in the median range: well below the first ""Iron Man,"" somewhat above ""X-Men: First Class."""
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,70,"Captain America is first and foremost an origins story. Almost half of the film's running time elapses before Rogers gets any kind of power at all, and though its elements are awfully familiar, it's the most involving part of the film because it takes advantage of Evans' performance."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,70,"Has a winningly pulpy, jaunty, earnest spirit."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,70,"Sticking to its simplistic, patriotic origins, where a muscular red, white and blue GI slugging Adolf Hitler in the jaw is all that's required, Captain America trafficks in red-blooded heroes, dastardly villains, classy dames and war-weary military officers."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,63,"Captain America falls into the prevalent pitfalls of origin stories. So much time and effort is expended explaining how the protagonist gains his super-powers (and exploring his initial usage of them) that there's not enough opportunity to develop a compelling storyline beyond his ""baptism."""
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,63,"From its antagonists to its art direction, everything about Johnston's movie has a been-there, seen-that familiarity. Yet Evans' clean-cut idealism and objectives make old-fashioned patriotism look fresh."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,63,This is what the ongoing onslaught of comic book movies lacks: stars. Real stars. Robert Downey Jr. is the exception when he should be the rule. It's possible we take these movies for granted because the marketing tells us we should.
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,63,"Here's the funny thing: Despite all the Captain America rah-rah in costume and indestructible shield, the movie is at its best when the story sticks with skinny Steve."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,63,"Tommy Lee Jones provides wisecracking levity as Rogers's commanding officer, Hayley Atwell supplies the aforementioned buxom chest and accompanying tough-girl grit as Rogers's British love interest, and Johnson directs with flair, his set pieces defined by both muscularity and clarity."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"The movie cleverly spins a meta-fictional ""origin"" myth for Captain America: explaining that he was in fact a propagandist comic-book superhero before becoming a real one. The final scene of the film, and Captain America's very last line, are rather brilliant – though admittedly less brilliant if their sole purpose is to set up sequels."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"Captain America: The First Avenger is all utility. It has everything you might want from a movie of this kind — bangs, baddies, nonsensical backstories — except for the most important element of all: surprise."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"Respect is due to Joe Johnston and his screenwriters for not only fashioning a nifty, highly entertaining slice of pulpy comic-book action, but for making this most divisive of costumed crusaders universally relatable."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"Charming, handsome and full of pep – all 70 year-old Cap lacks is a knockout blow. Still, Johnston should be saluted for old-fashioned heart in a cynical age, while Marvel should be confined to barracks for cynical marketing."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"The old-fashioned vibe, in fact, does more than just distinguish the story of skinny runt turned supersoldier Steve Rogers (Evans) from every other comic-book movie out there, though its fetishization of retro-techno gizmos and getups-call it leatherbucklepunk-immensely adds to the fun."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"In the end, the action sequences are just overblown and dollar-squandering, with no particular payoff in the entertainment department. The supporting actors - particularly Jones, Tucci and Luke - are the thing to watch here; they do all they can to keep the movie's gears running smoothly."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,50,The final conflict is so protracted as to comfortably accommodate a bathroom break. Don't worry. You won't miss anything you haven't seen before.
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,50,"Is there any doubt Evans' Captain America will do exactly what the character created 70 years ago by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby did in the comics – kick Nazi butt? The real surprise will come next year, when we get to see how the super-square Captain adapts to 21st-century life."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,50,"Evans – always a reliably dynamic and vivacious screen presence – can't do much to bring the character to life. As far as superheroes go, Cap remains a bit of a stiff."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,50,"As Marvel heroes go, Captain America must be the most vanilla of the lot."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,40,"Once Captain America goes off to war in his endearingly silly suit, however, the movie starts to lose its vibe."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,40,"(A) hokey, hacky, two-hour-plus exercise in franchise transition/price gouging, complete with utterly unnecessary post-converted 3-D."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,20,Captain America is simply awful. It is another hour and a half of prologue to the film people are apparently waiting for - The Avengers.
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,100,"Like a miniature universe made entirely of millions of tiny plastic bricks, The Lego Batman Movie looks and feels like it could only have been put together by a roomful of mad geniuses, moving in a ballet of well-choreographed creativity: It’s simultaneously epic and humble."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,100,"With The LEGO Batman Movie, a shiny, irresistible delight, blockbuster flicks have perfected their ideal form."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,90,"The first thing to say about The Lego Batman Movie is that it’s kicky, bedazzling, and super-fun."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,88,"The filmmakers’ fondness and respect for all things Batman are what elevate The Lego Batman Movie past the trappings of a funny cartoon. Who could have guessed, in the era of non-stop comic-book pictures, that a movie that uses toys as protagonist would do the most justice to the enigmatic Bruce Wayne?"
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,88,"Director Chris McKay keeps things zipping along, alternating between smart and often hilarious rapid-fire exchanges of dialogue, and big, big, BIG action sequences that fill every inch of the screen with brightly colored, fantastically kinetic action."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,88,"While The Dark Knight won't be supplanted any time soon as tops among Bat-movies, the new film makes a strong argument for second-best simply by taking time to explore the core of Batman that others haven’t: He’s a complicated mess who can’t get out of his own way long enough for the greater good."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,85,"The Lego Batman Movie, for the most part, very skillfully keeps the wackiness from overwhelming the plot and vice versa. And while the various Bat-vehicles take us through vertiginous zooms on land or through the air, McKay keeps the action rousing but never jumbled."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,83,"The film’s only real drawback, shared by its predecessor, is that it is simply too inventive. There must be more jokes and gags and throwaways per second than in 20 other comedies put together. It’s both exhilarating and exhausting."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,83,"LEGO Batman revs so fast and moves so frenetically that  it becomes a little exhausting by the end. It flirts with being too much of a good thing. But rarely has corporate brainwashing been so much fun and gone down with such a delightful aftertaste."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,83,"The pleasures of The LEGO Batman Movie are plentiful, especially its cockeyed reverence for the Dark Knight's past."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,83,"More fun than funny, more clever than smart, “LEGO Batman” moves too fast to acclimate audiences to the world it so eagerly dismantles and rebuilds (and too fast to make them want to stay there for a minute longer), but it serves as a frenzied reminder that laughing at the things we love is sometimes the best way to remember why we love them."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,80,"It’s really funny, though, an animated sendup of comic-book epics that vanquishes solemnity with the power of supersilliness."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,80,"In its best moments, this gag-a-minute Bat-roast serves as a reminder that, in the right hands, a sharp comic scalpel can be an instrument of revelation as well as ridicule."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,80,"In terms of jokes per minute that land, it’s at least the equal of its predecessor."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,80,"A highly quotable, visual treat that’s packed with in-jokes but is entertaining enough on its own terms to work for fans and non-fans alike. The best Batman film in years."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,80,"A ferociously paced, wildly silly pastiche of those comic-book blockbusters we’re all getting a bit sick of."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,80,"This version feels a lot less like a long advertisement for Lego products than the original, which featured multiple ""here's how to build something cool"" segments. And ""LEGO Batman"" uses pop culture better than the original."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,80,"It's as if the writers have set out with the most basic plot imaginable, hoping to cover the cracks with distractions and colourful set pieces. It works, but the lack of depth and emotional heart is noticeable when the film hits some of its less than spectacular moments."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,80,"While it never achieves, or even reaches for, The Lego Movie’s unexpected profundity and emotional bite, in purely logistical terms, The Lego Batman Movie is a thing of wonder. There are around four (great) films’ worth of action and jokes here, crammed into a story so streamlined it might have been assembled in the Lockheed wind tunnel."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,80,"An entertaining, if frenetic, vehicle for Arnett’s Bale-inspired Bats that packs plenty of laughs."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,80,"It doesn’t have the heart, the depth or the novelty of the first Lego movie, but it is relentlessly, consistently funny – which excuses everything."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,78,"It’s a rat-a-tat-tat animated comedy that rarely lets up, clever and silly and funny, and yes, a bit batty."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,75,"It all makes for an entertaining, occasionally delirious ride – especially the opening sequence."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,75,"Nutty as The Lego Batman Movie is in conception, it’s nifty in execution."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,75,"Tonally, it’s closer to the Adam West television program than to any of the subsequent incarnations, although (if possible) The Lego Batman Movie takes itself even less seriously."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,75,Michael Keaton and Christian Bale are the best. George Clooney and Ben Affleck are among the worst. But Will Arnett is by far the funniest.
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,75,"The movie is sufficiently in touch with current comic books that it’s keen to explore Batman’s psychology — breezily, but still."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,75,Don't obsess over the rough edges. The Lego Batman Movie rises on its own goofball spirits. Wanna get nuts and shake your sillies out? This is the place to do it.
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,75,You sense that a lot of the funniest stuff is flying by too quickly to land.
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,75,"Crucially, the emotional scenes are some of the ones in which the film lets off the throttle for a bit."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,75,"The Lego Batman Movie is less awesome than its predecessor, but it’s a clever, well-paced, self-aware and completely satisfying kind of less awesome."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,75,"The show, however, belongs to Batman and Will Arnett. This is a movie that will be enjoyed heartily and repeatedly."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,75,"If The Lego Movie was a delightful tribute to the multifaceted experiences of playing with Legos, this movie is like one of the licensed sets that inspired it: Less essential, more market-driven, and still irresistible for certain kids, fans, and nerds."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,75,"Given the sheer volume of jokes on hand, it’s impressive how often LEGO Batman successfully lands its punchlines."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,75,"The film is an unbroken chain of one-liners, sight gags, and pop-culture references, and the hit-to-miss ratio is high."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,70,"As gateway drugs go, The Lego Batman Movie is pretty irresistible. It’s silly without being truly strange or crossing over into absurdity. Along the way it pulls off a nifty balancing act: It gives the PG audience its own Batman movie (it’s a superhero starter kit) and takes swipes at the subgenre, mostly by gently mocking the seriousness that has become a deadening Warner Bros. default."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,70,"The LEGO Batman Movie is entertaining, but it also sometimes feels less like a spin-off of The LEGO Movie and more like one of its targets."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,70,"Like The LEGO Movie before it, The LEGO Batman Movie is far more entertaining than a giant piece of crass commercialism has any right to be."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,70,"Although there is still much to enjoy here, this DC Comics-fueled Lego adventure fails to clear the creative bar so energetically raised by co-directors and writers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller back in 2014."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,70,"While this spin-off to 2014’s more consistently inspired The Lego Movie is a decidedly hit-or-miss affair, it boasts enough giddy good humour and manic rambunctiousness to bludgeon the viewer into submission."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,70,"When it counts, The LEGO Batman Movie delivers everything you’d want from such a farcical superhero creation."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,63,"At 104 minutes, this CG/looks-like-stop-motion cartoon, drags. The screen is overcrowded with characters and gadgets that make it feel like a long, LEGO commercial."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,63,The Lego Batman Movie offers more mayhem and less funny.
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,63,"There is plenty of visual razzle-dazzle, to be sure, but not much else."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,60,"After that kick-ass opening, the picture devolves into an action-action-plot-action-plot-action monotone."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,58,"Lord knows the superhero genre could use some fun poked at it and we were psyched to see the film, but while there’s some fun to be had, it can’t help but feel like a missed opportunity."
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,50,The last hour is like a night at the comedy club after the headliners have left and the room has the smell of stale beer and flop sweat.
The Lego Batman Movie,7.3,175750384,30,"The greatest disappointment is how much of the script seems to have been assembled from a kit by someone afraid to deviate from the instructions. In a sequel to ""The Lego Movie,"" that’s not just a letdown, it’s a betrayal."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,100,"Dares to present a flat-out heroic president, without the safety net of irony. It succeeds."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,100,"Ford makes such a dynamic president in Air Force One, you may find yourself favorably weighing his odds in Iowa and New Hampshire."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,100,Director Wolfgang Petersen puts such a fresh spin on the familiar that it all works like gangbusters.
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,90,"Fulfils all its early promise, delivering a well oiled, no-nonsense, supremely entertaining crowd pleaser."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,88,A meat-and-potatoes American thriller that means business all around the world.
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,80,Viewers looking for old-fashioned movie thrills as a change of pace from the glut of alien and digital-oriented features might paradoxically enjoy the feeling of being back on terra firma with this airborne adventure.
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,80,"Takes its absurd premise and keeps itself narrowly focused, pushing its heroic cast through obstacle after obstacle."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,80,"Think of this as ""Die Hard"" in a suit, with an election coming up."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,80,"Peterson's film is a huge, loud beast of a film, filled with gunfire, explosions, and not a few tears. It's all grounded, however, in Ford's gritted-teeth performance as President Marshall."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,75,"Petersen ratchets the tension up to a level where the viewer is likely to forget the imbecilic plot contrivances that have gotten the situation to this point, and just enjoy the action and adventure."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,75,"A fairly competent recycling of familiar ingredients, given an additional interest because of Harrison Ford's personal appeal."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,70,"The first 20 minutes of Wolfgang Petersens new action adventure, Air Force One, are so thrillingly choreographed (and so very, very loud), its all the more disappointing that the balance of the movie tends to move less like a Stealth bomber and more like a jalopy  jerking fitfully from plot hole to plot hole, only occasionally finding momentum."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,67,"The film's biggest flaw -- aside from the lapses of credibility, which are almost obligatory in escapist summer movies -- is that it flies on and on until its power to hold us simply peters out."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,63,"Trapped uncomfortably between its higher aspirations and the demands of genre, this picture never quite gets its bearings, but it's still a solid ride."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,63,"The movie wastes a good opportunity to look at important questions, such as who's responsible for American policy when the president is busy killing terrorists."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,60,"An over-the-top thriller, too loosely tethered to reality to be a lesson about anything other than the limits of popcorn consumption."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,60,The picture's attempt to satisfy the aggressive fantasies of a graying white-male audience is weirdly fascinating. It's something you don't see every day: a geriatric comic book.
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,50,"Wolfgang Petersen and writer Andrew Marlowe, apparently afraid to really make fun of any American icons, challenge us to take the story straight no matter what, but the only thing this ponderous movie has going for it is its unintentional humor."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,50,"There's not a single thing about Air Force One to recommend, except perhaps the controlled performance of Glenn Close, who does remarkably well as the recipient of several phone calls from the sky."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,50,"If you've ever sat in a jet waiting on the runway, feeling it lumbering along in place and then bucking and shaking when it's cleared for take-off, you know what it's like to sit through Air Force One."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,80,"The pacing is spot-on, the set-pieces memorable and all the characters are allowed to shine, without it ever becoming The Johnny Depp Show."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,75,"""Dead Men” works well enough as a stand-alone, swashbuckling comedic spectacle, thanks to the terrific performances, some ingenious practical effects, impressive CGI and a steady diet of PG-13 dialogue peppered with not particularly sophisticated but (I have to admit) fairly funny sexual innuendo."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,75,"Johnny Depp’s drunken Captain Jack Sparrow stumbles into yet another seafaring adventure, which has its rocky moments but also offers an engaging tale with family legacies, above-average swashbuckling and a fantastic new villain courtesy of Javier Bardem"
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,70,"Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn’t rewrite the rulebook for the franchise or the genre as a whole, and is wholly predictable from start to finish, but the likable characters—Thwaites and Scodelario have more natural presence and mutual chemistry than Bloom and Knightley—creative action set pieces, and Depp finally being put in his place in the franchise creates a fun ride that’s instantly forgettable. You know, like the ride itself."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,67,"Directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg work up a stormy sea-parting finale that is better than anything in “The Ten Commandments.” Again, the trick to enjoying this film is to expect nothing."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,67,"What we get is the usual mash of swashbuckling nonsense and soggy mythology: There will be romance, and revelations, and some silly gold-plated cameos (hello there, Sir Paul McCartney! And whoops, goodbye). Through it all, Norwegian duo Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg (the Oscar-nominated Kon-Tiki) feel less like directors than shepherds."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,67,"Kon-Tiki directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg are at the helm this time around, proving capable captains even if the script they’re working from isn’t always seaworthy."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,65,"The fifth entry, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, is the most divertingly enjoyable since the first. A professionally crafted brew of action, slapstick and supernatural mumbo-jumbo, it’s less likely to spur timepiece glances than did the last few bloated installments."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,63,It’s fast paced but goes nowhere new and the film’s “bigness” makes it hard to remember what an amazingly unexpected treasure The Curse of the Black Pearl was.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,63,"Much as Bardem enlivens things, the real source of zip is Kaya Scodelario (“Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials”). Charming and spirited, she’s Daisy Ridley dialed up a notch."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,63,"Kon Tiki directors Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg strike just the right tone, and found just enough heart left in this tattered tale."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,60,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales manages to be less bloated, dreary, and meandering than the last three entries have been, but it still suffers from many of the same wearisome, dredged-up villains and ho-hum action and comedy that have bedeviled the franchise since its second installment."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,60,I found Dead Men Tell No Tales to be passably fun and certainly no harder to watch than any of the better-pedigreed blockbusters this year.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,60,"Screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (Catch Me If You Can), taking over from series regulars Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, doesn’t make much sense out of the typically (for the franchise) convoluted plot, but does manage to bring out a father-child theme that lends the film a little emotional resonance."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,60,"The gonzo-Wagnerian backstory the franchise subsequently built up hasn’t been sufficiently pruned – and with so many characters to juggle, the story feels less like a coherent chain of events than a bundle of obligatory subplots."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,60,"It's hardly original nor necessary, but it's a fun and absorbing escapade on the Seven Seas."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,58,"Waste enough of the audience’s time with the adventures of a couple of uncharismatic dinguses, and Depp’s stage-drunk, innuendo-laced, cabaret-emcee shtick starts to creep back into being funny."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,"The most engaging performance is Javier Bardem’s solidly nasty Captain Salazar, the undead commander of a ghost ship. His disintegrating skin and holey crew are fabulously rendered as evaporating digitizations: It’s the special effects and swelling action sequences that make the movie palatable."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,The franchise has sadly devolved into a cynical cash grab.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,Those who go to see “Dead Men Don’t Tell Tales” might just recognize that hollow feeling as they leave the theater.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,"Loud, overstimulating and hard to take in all in one sitting, it feels like the vacation that you’ll need a vacation from."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,Calling Dead Men Tell No Tales the most entertaining Pirates of the Caribbean movie since the original is a backhanded compliment with all the bilge water under the bridge since then. Time to deep six Capt. Jack Sparrow. This franchise should tell no more tales.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,"The proportions of good parts to not are more generous than they’ve been in years, though there’s still much too much of the usual undead sea dogs killing their prisoners and rumbling on about curses."

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,42,"As the coldly calculated Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales proves, it is time to let this series rest in peace, or at the very least, spend the rest of its doomed, immortal days sinking to the bottom of the ocean."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"There are no new treasures to be found in this installment, which is dragged down by the anchor of a prescribed franchise blueprint."

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"Not the return to form you might have been hoping for. Its story might cover all the same beats as the 2003 original, but there’s little of that film’s spark or spirit."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"The franchise has lost a bit of its luster with every successive installment, but never has a “Pirates” film felt this inessential, this depressingly pro forma."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"Scodelario, of the Maze Runner films and Andrea Arnold's Wuthering Heights, is just about the only member of the cast who seems to believe she's expected to be more than a thin generic functionary or flamboyant scene-stealer."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"Unfortunately for everyone, Captain Jack Sparrow is still slurring and staggering around the Caribbean. Whatever charm and charisma Johnny Depp once had in this role is well and truly lost at sea."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"Dead Men Tell No Tales moves at a faster rate of knots than any Pirates film; trouble is, nothing has really been added. It’s the same soggy ride, set to a marginally preferable speed."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,38,"Directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg (“Kon-Tiki”) seem to not have the slightest idea how to make this material sing; instead, it’s mostly a noisy, dark 3D blur in which the characters run around a lot, seemingly looking for the exits"
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,33,"The film is not unlike a classic rock supergroup reuniting to play all the greatest hits, with the payday at the end as the only true motivation, rather than returning with something new to say about their work."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,30,It’s stuffed to the gills with effects executed by the highest-paid artists and technicians in the business. But it’s still a sorry spectacle.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,25,"It’s a little less cute these days to watch his Jack Sparrow swish about drunkenly, knowing the actor’s an abusive lush. Equally wearisome is the spectacle of a once-entertaining franchise staggering around, devoid of purpose."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,25,“Dead Men” is a jumble of half-baked impulses.

The Matrix,8.7,171479930,60,"The real soullessness here is built into the production, a polished adaptation of Hong Kong-style filmmaking that, with its cast of depressive characters, allows for little Hong Kong-style joy."

Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,83,"Kong: Skull Island is an offering to the hungry mouths at the multiplex who want to cheer a movie that doesn't insult, or tax, their intelligence."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,83,"It also cannot be overstated what an asset [John C.] Reilly is. The moment he shows up, the movie feels enlivened and energized; his mere presence adds a tremendous amount of oddball charm and humor."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,"The picture is grand and nutty and visually splendid: Vogt-Roberts knows he's gotta go big or go home, so he treads boldly."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,"The new Kong: Skull Island really gets it right — the exotic adventure, the spectacular special effects, the towering terrors. It’s a big hunk of nostalgic fun, reminding us of the 1933 original even as it monkeys around with the classic story."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,The surprise is that “Skull Island” isn’t just ten times as good as “Jurassic World”; it’s a rousing and smartly crafted primordial-beastie spectacular.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,"A large part of the enjoyment comes down to the sheer earth-shaking lunacy of Kong’s daily grind, even before the human intruders are factored in."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,"This highly entertaining return of one of the cinema's most enduring giant beasts moves like crazy — the film feels more like 90 minutes than two hours — and achieves an ideal balance between wild action, throwaway humor, genre refreshment and, perhaps most impressively, a nonchalant awareness of its own modest importance in the bigger scheme of things."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,"Kong: Skull Island is a grand cinematic adventure powered by furry fury, as the horrors of war blend with chest-beating creature confidence."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,The action and special effects are mostly first-rate and Vogt-Roberts maintains a vaguely satiric tone that sidesteps schlockiness.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"It is the platonic ideal of big, smart-dumb B-movie filmmaking – and, like Kong himself, it must be seen to be believed."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"If Reilly’s presence gives Kong: Skull Island its playful, gonzo edge, it’s the title character himself who gives it soul, morphing from a monster into a brooding symbol of the colossal folly of military belligerence and hegemonic hubris."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"If you’re looking for a film that offers pure escapism, Kong: Skull Island should definitely meet expectations."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"In this digital world that allows for Kong to be as big as a building and believably so, Roberts is smart to pull out all the stops. And if some of the story and character motivation gets left in the dust, so be it."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"Kong: Skull Island is fast, playful and ridiculous, a big-budget extravaganza with the soul of a spirited B-movie."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"Kong: Skull Island isn’t a remake or a reboot or a re-anything. It’s just a Saturday matinee creature feature with a smart, unpretentious script, a handful of solid supporting players, and a digital Kong who feels big enough and real enough to provoke the necessary awe. This is all to the movie’s credit."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"The monsters are brilliantly designed and skillfully animated (except for a few shots where Kong looks a tad cartoony), and the army of visual and sound effects artists convince you that that these CGI titans live and breathe and weigh hundreds of tons."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,It’s wildly entertaining and it has a sense of humor about itself.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"Kong: Skull Island is a smart SciFi action movie that doesn’t rely on a handful of monsters and random scenes of computerized destruction to run out the clock. It has a smart script, imaginative filmmaking and a cast of fine actors that actually get to act."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"The dialogue is clunky, the A-list actors are slumming and, yeah, you've seen it all before. But Kong: Skull Island is a creature feature that's damn near irresistible."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,Skull Island has a lot of globe-trotting fun assembling its team of expendables.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"Perhaps the most satisfying thing about the film is what comes after, when you stop to realize how darkly comic and sickly fun the film was after you’re done reeling from all the impaling and dismemberment."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,70,"In the struggle between sober subtext and monster-movie goofiness, the goofiness mostly wins out."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,67,"Hiddleston and Larson are especially let down by the script, which wants to be jokey in the way that something like Predator was, but can’t pull it off. The same lack of care goes into the period-specific song choices that have as much imagination as a Time-Life Songs of the ‘70s set."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,65,"It lacks neither fun nor polish, but it has the square tidiness of a compartmentalized fast-food meal."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,63,"As a big-budget B-grade monster movie, Kong: Skull Island is a home run. It offers all the tropes and clichés one expects from this sort of endeavor, sparing no expense when it comes to special effects. As a King Kong movie, however, Skull Island is less successful."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,63,"Kong: Skull Island won’t win any points for the brilliance of its writing (or for the way it reduces a terrific actor like Larson to a personality-free camera-clicker) — but oh, that ape"
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,63,It’s when there's a distinct lack of King Kong that Skull Island turns into a plodding affair.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"Story and soul are never going to be kings on Skull Island, but they could have fared better than this."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"“Skull Island” has momentum, polish and behemoths that slither and thunder. The sets and creature designs are often beautifully filigreed, but the larger picture remains murky."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"It's a heck of a cast, although the hands-down scene-stealer is John C. Reilly, in a gem of a comic-relief role that, in the interest of remaining spoiler-free, is probably best undescribed here."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"Kong: Skull Island is one of those movies best described as big, dumb fun."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,Derivative and a little dumb but consistently fun: there’s personality and panache to spare in this monster blockbuster.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"If the film belongs to anyone, it’s creature designer Carlos Huante. Kong is expressive and impressive, both in hair and full-body movement, and his interaction – with water, humans, other animals – is consistently fluid."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,King Kong lives! But only just. This is an uneven adventure that’s saved by the spectacle of its towering title character and the various beasts with whom he shares his island home.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"For all its updated bluster, this update still can’t escape the shadow of 1933’s magical King Kong."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"This is a creature feature, plain and simple — and, at least on a visceral level, a satisfying one."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,58,"Kong: Skull Island strips the beauty from a legendary beast, reducing a classic movie star to soulless monster mechanics. Kong smashes, but not much else. Whoever dies doesn't matter. Whoever lives has a sequel promised by the end credits."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,58,"Kong: Skull Island may include some clever period details and idiosyncratic asides, but it’s largely a blockbuster B-movie less interested in depth than scale."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,50,"Where Hiddleston seems perfectly at home in the digital trenches, gamely swinging at fiendish foes to be added in postproduction, Larson looks like she’s staring into thin air. That leaves us with the monsters, who are, to be fair, mightily impressive."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,50,"On the whole, though, Kong: Skull Island is great big dumb fun. It’s also shockingly beautiful to look at when you aren’t having creature guts flung into the camera."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,50,Vogt-Roberts never develops the characters enough to make us care whether anyone lives or dies and never whips up even a flirtation between Hiddleston and Larson.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,50,"It’s “Avatar” simplistic, glib and dumb and not nearly as funny as they seem to think it is."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,50,"The thing that breaks the back of this movie, and makes the second half so much less prodigious than the first, is a simple matter of geography. Once the combatants are split up and scattered around the island (Packard here, Chapman there, Conrad and Marlow stuck in their own heart of darkness), the story loses focus and even starts to drag."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,40,Its combination of lavishness and lack of imagination is the only thing memorable about it.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,40,"I’ve gone on about the creatures because there’s so little to say about the humans, who, in their turn, have little to say about the creatures, because the writers haven’t written enough lively dialogue."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,40,"Caution should always be taken when branding any film about an 80-foot ape ""illogical"", but such is the gross stupidity of the film's movable feast - and the abominable dialogue spewing from their mouths - that you'll likely thank the primate deity himself every time one is crushed, impaled or bisected."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,25,Every creature here that's intended to burrow themselves into the audience’s nightmares are less wonders of imagination than of size.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,20,"This fantastically muddled and exasperatingly dull quasi-update of the King Kong story looks like a zestless mashup of Jurassic Park, Apocalypse Now and a few exotic visual borrowings from Miss Saigon. It gets nowhere near the elemental power of the original King Kong or indeed Peter Jackson’s game remake; it’s something Ed Wood Jr might have made with a trillion dollars to do what he liked if he’d been given a trillion dollars – but minus the fun."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,80,"Dodgy history and dodgier accents, but Kevin Costner's medieval romp still has some magic – and shouldn't be judged on the weakness of its imitators."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,80,"Except for the political implications of the addition of Freeman's character (which he brings off gracefully) and some revisionism about the nobility of the crusades (which, in my opinion, is long overdue), Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is just an adventure movie - which is basically what I like about it. The second half is stronger than the first because it's swifter and more action-packed. Robin's feats of derring-do are always (as Costner might put it) neat - the more improbable, the better."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,75,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves looks like big money. It has the stars, it's based on a classic (and foolproof) story and it's an exhilarating couple of hours. It fills the entertainment megabill utterly."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,75,"Despite the miscasting of the central role and quite a lot of lackluster dialogue, the story proves again to be almost foolproof. The fight sequences are explosive, the physical production is impressive, and the supporting performances are full of juice."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,75,"As a piece of escapism, this deluxe, action-heavy, 2-hour-and-21-minute Robin Hood gets the job done. You’re carried along by plot, production values, and some choice supporting actors. Yet it’s a rouser without a rousing hero. Costner doesn’t disgrace himself — he has the star presence the role demands. What he’s not is an impassioned Robin Hood. And without the sense that Robin is on a humanistic mission (one that’s a pleasure to fulfill), the story has no charge."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,75,"With so much money and talent at work here, though, this latest incarnation of the legend is considerably smaller than the sum of its parts."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,70,"The mix of comedy, '90s sensibility, and swashbuckling action is more hit than miss, even if the overall effect is rather slapdash. Spirited, irreverent stuff, but not for those who like their myths kept sacred."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,67,"Not exactly Errol Flynn, but not the embarrassment that was Disney's Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves is a fun popcorn flick take on the centuries-old legend. And hey, it does have a great cameo by a former Robin Hood as the best King Richard ever."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,63,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is a murky, unfocused, violent and depressing version of the classic story, with little of the lightheartedness and romance we expect from Robin Hood."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,63,"Director Kevin Reynolds has no flair for action: the climactic battle is so ineptly shot and edited that it is difficult to tell who is smiting whom. While Costner is lifeless and speaks strangely (he was said to have attempted a British accent, then abandoned it during shooting), Mastrantonio is an acceptably vivacious Marian."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,60,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves has pomp and scale; what it lacks is something essential -- a sense of Once Upon a Time wonder, the exultant, heady thrill of legend."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,60,"Drawing purely on his technical skills, Reynolds is finally able to get some momentum going in the picture's final half-hour, when a defeated Robin musters the remains of his band and makes a last-ditch attempt on the Sheriff of Nottingham's castle. It seems to be enough to erase memories of the movie's painfully slow start and send the audience out reasonably happy and stimulated. But Robin Hood does not seem to be the defining blockbuster this summer still needs."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,60,"Though the new Robin Hood observes all of the classic confrontations that keep the tale alive, the film winds up as a mixture of listless adventure, wispy comedy and what is meant to pass for social realism."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,50,"Kevin Costner very definitely isn't Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and his noticeable awkwardness in that rebel's role underlines the problems this muddled, fitfully effective version of a most durable English legend has in deciding which face it wants to present to the world at large. While the makers of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves may have set out to bury the poor old duffer of Sherwood Forest in a welter of trendy banter, they have ended up burying themselves as well."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,50,"Not till the very end of the film, when King Richard pops up, portrayed, in a surprise appearance, by an actor who has launched many a grand movie adventure, will audiences get a glimpse of epic star quality. Then, like the Merry Men, they will unleash a hearty ho-ho. The rest of this Robin Hood merits only a ho-hum."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,50,"The picture only comes alive at the end with Robin and his Moorish helper (Morgan Freeman in a typically strong performance) turning into a medieval Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in hand-to-hand combat with the sheriff. Otherwise, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an entertainment without a particular point of view."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,50,"Black powder and Christian Slater are cool and all, but real dramatic successes come when a film has both heart and a slate of talented actors who aren’t just leaning on their oversized patchwork capes to tell the story."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,50,"Kevin Costner’s Robin Hood is a Robin of wood. Murky and uninspired, this $50 million rendition bears evidence of the rushed and unpleasant production circumstances that were much reported upon."
Batman Returns,7,162831698,100,"Batman Returns could mark a happy beginning for Hollywood -- not because it might make a mint but because it dispenses with realism and aspires to animation, to the freedom of idea and image found in the best feature-length cartoons."
Batman Returns,7,162831698,91,I find it the most adventurous and imaginative American film I've seen this year - and also the weirdest.
Batman Returns,7,162831698,88,"Like the hero himself, the movie is larger than life - a horrific fantasy that gets carried away with itself as the mood builds and the tension mounts"
Batman Returns,7,162831698,80,"Burton has once again managed to pursue his quirky personal concerns in the context of broadly commercial entertainment, although the idiosyncracies of the villains clearly interest him far more than the programmable heroics of the title character and the related mandatory action sequences."
Batman Returns,7,162831698,80,Burton continues to capture the essence of the Batman legend and more importantly his audiences imagination.
Batman Returns,7,162831698,80,"To come out of the summer haze and enter the dark (and cool) wonder of Batman Returns is a pleasure not to be denied. Even more than before, this cartoon opera about cloistered personalities bathes exultantly in moody blues, gothic music swirls and a symphony of character tragedy."
Batman Returns,7,162831698,80,"Visually, Batman Returns is marvelous to behold. There are images on that screen that make you laugh with delight and admiration for the sheer imaginativeness of it. But Burton also brings up some really interesting themes only to lose interest somewhere along the way."
Batman Returns,7,162831698,78,"This baby takes place in Tim Burton's id. It's a great place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there."
Batman Returns,7,162831698,75,Our rooting interest is not for any macho act by Batman to save the city but for each character to achive some sort of emotional peace. That makes for a strange but refreshing action story.
Batman Returns,7,162831698,75,Burton uses the summer's most explosively entertaining movie to lead us back into the liberating darkness of dreams.
Batman Returns,7,162831698,75,"This demented toyshop of a movie is a bit of a mess, but it's a visionary mess. Of how many sequels can that be said?"
Batman Returns,7,162831698,75,"Mr. Burton's new Batman Returns is as sprightly as its predecessor was sluggish, and it succeeds in banishing much of the dourness and tedium that made the first film such an ordeal."
Batman Returns,7,162831698,70,"Batman Returns offers many jolts of pleasure, yet it’s also a mess — a gilded sketchbook of a movie that keeps falling open to random pages."
Batman Returns,7,162831698,70,"As Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands reminded us, Burton always has been more absorbed by what his audience sees than by what his movies say. It's part of his unique talent as a filmmaker, but it leads him to ignore the flaws in the structure of what is, after all, supposed to be an exciting adventure film."
Batman Returns,7,162831698,67,"I give the movie a negative review, and yet I don't think it's a bad movie; it's more of a misguided one, made with great creativity, but denying us what we more or less deserve from a Batman story."
Batman Returns,7,162831698,63,"Batman Returns, the most eagerly awaited and aggressively hyped film of the summer, is, for better and worse, very much the product of director Tim Burton's morose imagination. His dark, melancholy vision is undeniably something to see, but it is a claustrophobic conception, not an expansive one, oppressive rather than exhilarating, and it strangles almost all the enjoyment out of this movie without half trying."
Batman Returns,7,162831698,63,"Director Tim Burton and his screenwriters bring a heavy-handed, plodding realism to bear on what should be pop-mythic material."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,100,"Made with a palpable sense of urgency, this tense, propulsive motion picture is a model of what mainstream entertainment can be like when everything goes right."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,100,"What could be a cash grab turns out to be the series' finest chapter, with the same piano-wire tension plus a narrative clarity lacking before."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,95,"This fourth entry after a nine-year break for Damon and Greengrass should represent, for those ready and able to separate popcorn mayhem from the grim realities of world headlines, a bruising and exhilarating ride."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,88,"Despite regurgitating elements from the founding trilogy, Jason Bourne represents the best the series has yet offered."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,88,"Through it all, Damon keeps us glued to the war going on inside Bourne's head. It's a brilliantly implosive performance; he owns the role and the movie. It's a tense, twisty mindbender anchored by something no computer can generate: soul."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,88,"Working from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Christopher Rouse, director Paul Greengrass has come up with a post-Snowden film that delivers nonstop thrills."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,88,"Jason Bourne is the best action thriller of the year so far, with a half-dozen terrific chase sequences and fight scenes."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,83,"Director Paul Greengrass (Captain Phillips, United 93) has always had a taste for the topical and political, and his third Bourne outing augments the usual truth-and-justice talking points with a strenuously current nod to digital privacy issues via a Zuckerberg-like social-media mogul (Riz Ahmed). If anything, he underplays those assets, shorting deeper story development for exotic zip codes, bang-up fisticuffs, and adrenalized chase scenes."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,80,"Yes, Jason Bourne basically amounts to a trio of action set-pieces elegantly strung together. But who really cares when they’re this impressive?"
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,80,"This explosive reunion between Damon and director Paul Greengrass further reveals key secrets about Bourne’s origins, bringing its lethal protagonist as close as he’s ever likely to get to total recall."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,75,"Other welcome faces include Alicia Vikander as a CIA analyst who has a better bead on Bourne than her superiors; Julia Stiles, in a repeat appearance as the spy’s former contact; and Riz Ahmed as a Silicon Valley billionaire."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,75,"At its best Jason Bourne crackles with professionalism; at its worst, it's rehashing greatest hits (as in, ""assassinations"") from earlier films, with a lavish budget."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,70,Its smooth efficiency offers plenty of sturdy pleasures. What’s missing are the emotional underpinnings that made these movies not just top-flight action vehicles but also stirringly soulful.
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,70,"Up until a narratively implausible and logistically ridiculous climactic motorcycle chase through Vegas that feels like a sop to the Fast & Furious crowd, Jason Bourne is an engrossing re-immersion in the violent and mysterious world of Matt Damon's shadowy secret op."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,67,"For all its problems, Bourne is still thrilling and an undoubtedly engrossing action film thanks to its taut construction."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,63,"The tradecraft is there, the film craft is there, but the craftiness of a great concept is gone. Any way Bourne can go through Treadstone again?"
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,63,"I love the series, but Jason Bourne is the worst of the five."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,63,"It exists for no other reason than that people like Matt Damon, they like him as this character, and the producers know audiences are willing to see more of him."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,63,"The movie gets lost in its focus on flash and speed, and forgets about the man — and the fine, quiet actor — at its center."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,"Greengrass is as dexterous as ever, yet the result, though abounding in thrills, seems oddly stifled by self-consciousness and, dare one say, superfluous. Come on, guys. There are so many wrongs in the world. If Bourne could tear himself away from the mirror for a moment, could he not be persuaded to go and right them?"
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,"Should you see it? Sure. The absolutely absurd, over-the-top Vegas chase scene assures you’ll get your money’s worth in ridiculousness. (Not all of Greengrass’ set pieces are smart.) But in truth, you’ll be there because it’s a Bourne movie, and you’ll like it a little better than you should because it is."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,"Greengrass, a meticulous, thoughtful filmmaker (he also directed the second and third films in the series, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum), clearly believes in what he’s doing. But his earnestness is at odds with the movie’s desperate, frenetic desire to keep us engaged every minute."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,"The tedium, I would argue, is not incidental but essential, because this is not really a spy thriller or even a foot-chase and fist-fight-driven action movie, but rather a somber meditation on the crisis of the Gen-X professional in the throes of middle age."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,"Leagues ahead of Legacy but the weakest of the Matt Damon movies, Bourne still has the power to thrill. But it seems his story has run out of steam."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,"When the talking stops the film takes off, with a pair of bone-rattling chases set in Athens and Las Vegas that cause maximum damage to people, property and the audience’s eardrums. A bracing reminder of how fiercely efficient Greengrass can be, these scenes just about justify the existence of Jason Bourne. But, please, no more."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,"The political commentary feels far more explicitly pointed and widely integral than in previous incarnations which adds a bold new dynamic where perhaps the same re-inventive verve is lacking in the film's formulaic story. Fortunately, Greengrass and Damon are so in command of this material it's rarely too much of a concern. Even when little of substance seems to be happening, the narrative feels propulsive."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,"Hunting Bourne is more than ever a business now, with a bottom line to worry about, a crowd to please, and presumably hasty deadlines to meet. It’s not that there’s no pause for thought in this still-good-fun episode. There’s just not enough thought in the pauses."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,The Snowden/social media plotline of this film does a bit to make Bourne more relevant. But the ingredients are basically the same.
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"While Jason Bourne isn’t half-bad as an action movie, it is a nakedly hollow exercise in resuscitating brand loyalty."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"As an actor, Matt Damon has too much integrity to pretend he can multitask to that advanced degree and still be, you know, a fun person. So he turns his face into a mask of stoicism and gives the dullest performance of his career."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"When it’s over, even viewers more eager to forgive this failed creative reunion will wonder what it is that they just watched, and what purpose it serves other than financial. And why no one figured out a new, engaging way to tell a story that’s already been told."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"Jason Bourne belongs to Damon and Greengrass, whose admirable — and entirely appropriate — goal of playing it for kicks comes across, this time around, as an oddly joyless chore."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"Rather than push this character or story forward, the film cravenly hits the reset button, doing more of the same with much less passion and skill."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"This current film smartly adds material that keeps it up-to-date with the reality of today’s sophisticated electronic surveillance. The series may become a marker by which we come to gauge the future disappearance of all personal privacy. For the sake of the series’ endurance, I hope so, but for the sake of the rest of us, I hope not."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,The movie is a by-the-numbers action film that's not nearly as strong as its Damon-led predecessors.
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"There are scenes I dug and a few set-pieces that work, and there’s an overall level of intensity that I like from director Paul Greengrass. Taken as a whole, though, this is very familiar territory, and I just don’t care when the stakes are this low and the violence is this rough."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"There’s just not a lot of weight to this sequel, at least not enough to dissuade anyone from seeing this as anything but a limpid cash grab."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,The visceral visuals make this a barely-serviceable/watchable summer popcorn picture. But the bar was set high too long ago for that to be enough for America’s Bond.
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"While a reunion between Greengrass and Damon should feel like a refreshing extension of the franchise, Jason Bourne is just another replica, and an unnecessary one. The familiar pieces are in place, but it adds nothing that Greengrass hadn’t already accomplished. Maybe its best we let Jason Bourne retire for good."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,Jason Bourne adheres to an existing format so robotically that it never manages to surprise or engage for longer than the occasional passing moment.
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,49,"Eventually, even perpetual pursuit gets dull, and Jason Bourne finds that point early, then just keeps charging monotonously forward."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,40,"Bourne used to be an anguished amnesiac. Now he remembers who he is, but this fourth episode of the franchise forgot to make him human."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,40,"While the result is an often fast-moving and very Damon-y Jason Bourne, it doesn't at all feel as original or as well crafted as the series once did."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,40,"Even when it comes to life, Jason Bourne offers very little that could stand on its own; its best scenes remind you of even better ones in the earlier films. There's a greatest-hits quality to the movie, only the band is tired and its heart isn't in it."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,40,"Once the story drags Bourne out of retirement, it's just a bunch of fights and chase scenes, only occasionally interrupted by a few lines of dialogue."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,38,"This stale, redundant story goes round in the same tight circles, revealing one piddling new secret and containing one unconvincing change of character."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,38,"One of the more admirable traits of the original Bourne trilogy is how little pleasure it takes in its violence, but Jason Bourne revels in its vicious action sequences."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,33,I've rarely seen so much effort for so little thrill.
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,33,"Simultaneously pretentious, mind-numbingly tedious, and dizzyingly incoherent from scene to scene, Jason Bourne is the definition of diminishing returns."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,25,"The character motivations are weak, and the story is poorly structured. But its camera work, possibly intended to distract audiences from the movie’s flaws, only compounds its problems. It distances the audience and makes Jason Bourne a chore to sit through."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,90,"If The Heat is about more than being a well-oiled delivery system for impressive and effective comedy, it's in part about what it means to be a good cop — including the question of how gender does or doesn't factor into that."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,88,This is one of the most entertaining movies of the year.
The Heat,6.6,159582188,80,A good cop/bad cop action comedy with the funniest two-women-above-the-title pairing in memory.
The Heat,6.6,159582188,79,"A bawdy and belligerent comedy, meant mostly for folks looking for nothing more than to enjoy a few laughs."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,75,"The Heat is violent, with some pretty gruesome moments and some questionable police work. That's part of the fun. Cagney and Lacey these two ain't. When they finally join forces, they go rogue with a gusto that is refreshing."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,75,"One character dares to open up a debate about sex roles in the workplace; because he does so indelicately, Feig expects you to cheer when he takes a bullet to the head. To his credit, he is correct."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,75,"The Heat is the best female buddy-cop movie since, well, ever."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,75,"The Heat, which provides enough opportunity for wholesale mayhem as well as laughs, is pretty much a guaranteed crowd-pleaser."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,75,"With Bullock doing a variation on her Miss Congeniality geek-tomboy-who-has-to-bloom character, and McCarthy letting her acidly oddball observations rip, the two actresses make their interplay bubble."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,75,"At its sharpest, The Heat actually moves and banters like a comedy, with sharply timed and edited dialogue sequences driven by a couple of pros ensuring a purposeful sense of momentum."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,75,"After watching the trailers, I was expecting torture, but this smart, subversive movie made me laugh. So shoot me."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,75,"If you’re going to make a dopey, bawdy, foul-mouthed, predictable lady-buddy-cop movie, you might as well make it funny. And until it overstays its welcome in the final half-hour, The Heat is shamefully funny."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,75,"As a buddy-cop movie, The Heat seems almost deliberately generic, with boilerplate plotting carried across with zero panache. It wagers that McCarthy and Bullock’s comic energy will make all the difference—a smart bet, as it happens."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,70,"At times The Heat gets messy, and the comedy is not always pitch perfect. But they're cops. They're enemies. They're friends. They're opposites. It's funny."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,70,"Breaking it down, The Heat has been engineered to deliver the laughs, and the result certainly does, despite coming alarmingly near to botching the procedural elements along the way."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,70,"The script's simpleminded shenanigans notwithstanding, the two stars sync up better than their characters do, especially with some rough-and-tumble physical slapstick, resulting in a crude, low-brow audience-pleaser that will hit the funny bones of both performers' fan bases."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,70,"If the film takes too long to wrap itself up --and hints, predictably, at a sequel -- the funky soundtrack is fun and McCarthy's South Boston relations are a scream."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,67,"When director Paul Feig — who revitalized feminine comedy with ""Bridesmaids"" — allows McCarthy's improvisational instincts to take over because, honestly, nobody else in the cast can stand up to her. McCarthy is the best thing about The Heat."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,67,"More often than not The Heat is just stupid-funny, which circles us back to McCarthy, motor-mouthing four-letter fury like an operatic aria. She sells Mullins as delightfully unhinged and fairly radiating with rage, and it’s irresistible."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,67,"McCarthy is a force of comic nature. And she and Bullock mix it up like pros. In this dead-battery of a movie, these live-wires miraculously ignite sparks."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,63,"This profanely hilarious and tonally erratic spoof of buddy movies is funny as it begins in ""Miss Congeniality 2"" territory, funnier still as it zooms into ""Lethal Weapon"" climes. But it stops dead, and I mean that literally, when it takes a U-turn into a ""Pulp Fiction"" sinkhole of slapstick violence."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,63,"With the film, Melissa McCarthy definitively cements her status as a legitimate comic talent, leaving her co-star stumbling behind in her wake."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,63,"Following the buddy-cop handbook to the letter, The Heat is derivative stuff, but McCarthy gives it the kick it needs to keep rolling along."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,60,"Scenes go on too long. Jokes outwear their welcome. The plot, though perfunctory (it’s no more complex or intriguing than the average hourlong television crime procedural), gets muddled. Even though McCarthy keeps the laughs coming, The Heat doesn’t really pack enough."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,60,"The Heat is kind of a mess, but it’s a funny mess."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,60,They (Bullock/McCarthy) deserve a much stronger showcase than this Laurel & Hardy Go Policin’ vehicle.
The Heat,6.6,159582188,60,"Every foul-mouthed joke [McCarthy] cracks, every unexpected physical gag she underplays, is so funny you forget how often we’ve seen this setup. Or, when it comes to women, how rarely."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,60,"It’s not really such a great achievement to have women cops in the movies acting as boorish and rowdy as their male counterparts, especially since the movie seems designed for a sequel. But then again, what movie these days – or at least this summer – isn’t?"
The Heat,6.6,159582188,58,"Part of the point here is to stake a claim on a genre that’s traditionally been a boys’ club, and in that regard, The Heat delivers: In a bonding moment, this odd couple goes on a bender as epic as anything in ""The Hangover."" Their enthusiasm with weapons should alarm viewers across all demographics and species."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,58,"The movie -- too much of it -- is spent testing the boundaries of how loud and obnoxious McCarthy can be. Feig doesn't hand this able comic actress the gift of freedom; he simply gives her enough rope, which isn't nearly the same thing."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,50,"What is the point of making a movie that’s just like the dopiest, broadest and most reductive grade of guy-oriented comedy, except with women?"
The Heat,6.6,159582188,50,"If this were funny, The Heat would add up to your average buddy-cop comedy. Except that it’s not funny, at least not very and not often."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,50,"The volatile chemistry between Ms. McCarthy and Ms. Bullock is something to behold, and carries The Heat through its lazy conception and slapdash execution."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,50,"Give it up for Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy. You’ll never see them work harder at a  comedy than in The Heat, a stumbling, aggressively loud and profane cop buddy picture where they struggle to wring “funny” out of a script that isn’t."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,38,"Bullock and McCarthy and the chemistry they generate are far more compelling than the movie they’re in. Too often the sketches go on too long, and the coarse, abrasive tone quickly begins to feel repetitive and off-putting."
The Heat,6.6,159582188,37,"Grotesque doesn't begin to describe Ms. McCarthy's new character. Scarily insane comes closer; repulsive occasionally applies. Mullins's insanity can be extremely funny from time to time, but her anger grows as punishing for the audience as it does for the victims of her unrestrained police work."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,100,"There’s a brisk sense of invention to the film, and it feels like it is breathlessly told, something that is due in large part to Justin Lin, who has been developing a very particular approach to blockbuster filmmaking. Yes, he’s fine with the big action mayhem that is par for the course with these films, but he understands that the thing that makes any of it interesting is making sure the audience really enjoys spending time with these characters."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,83,"Lin siphons elements of his previous gig into this one. More precisely, he accentuates the existing ""family"" dynamic of Star Trek, leading to genuinely earned lumps in Trekker throats."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,83,I do hope there will be many more future installments. I’d like to spend more time with these folks.
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,83,"Star Trek Beyond is a vast improvement from the sloppy Into Darkness, bringing it on par with the excellent ’09 reboot in terms of sheer quality and chemistry."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,"It’s not just a blast but, at moments, a thing of beauty, alive to the comic awesomeness of being lost in space."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,"Star Trek Beyond may not go where no Trek has gone before, but it’s that very fidelity to the show’s original values that will keep fans trekking to the box office."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,"It’s better to have a well-made, unapologetic action-adventure like this one than a creepy stab at replication."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,This movie isn’t just fun; it’s sincere and sweet and downright inspiring.
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,"Lin keeps this tense adventure (co-written by Doug Jung and Simon Pegg, who also reprises his role as chief engineer Scotty) from stumbling over its own excess: he knows that any good Star Trek needs wit as well as spectacle."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,"It's not only filled with the usual special-effects eye candy, but smart, fan-focused writing."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,"This is all fun all the time, a dizzying carnival of wisecracks, fisticuffs, explosions, chases and truly eye-popping effects."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,"While Beyond won't unseat 1982's thrilling The Wrath of Khan as the gold standard for Star Trek movies, it's a highly entertaining entry guaranteed to give the franchise continuing life."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,"A return to fun, and a return to form for the new version of the old Trek. The 13th Trek movie is also the second good odd-numbered instalment in a row. Lucky for some."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"With Lin at the helm, and the Enterprise crew reimagined as a family unit in the mold of Dom Toretto’s gang, the movie bounces along, hurtling its heroes over colliding wreckage and into currents of artificial gravity, pausing just long enough for a punchline or a knowing exchange of looks."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"Pine brings a measured but engaging heroism to Kirk. Quinto is perfect as the logical but charismatic Spock. Urban lends the proceedings a much appreciated dose of humor. And even with his famously expressive face obscured by makeup, Elba elevates Krall to something more than a cardboard villain."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"Despite the futuristic tilt in the title, Star Trek Beyond works best when it boldly goes retro."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"Star Trek Beyond plays like an episode of the old “Star Trek” TV series. This, I submit, is what’s enjoyable about it."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"Sometimes silly, outlandish, and sentimental in its fan service-y callbacks, Star Trek Beyond and its sense of entertaining urgency often trumps its insubstantial qualities, as illogical as that may be."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"It may not boldly go where no “Star Trek” film has gone before, but it gets there at warp speed, and with a full tank of fresh ideas."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"Even with its big-screen pyrotechnics and its feature-length running time, Star Trek Beyond plays like an extended version of one of the better episodes from the original series, and I mean that in the best possible way."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"Happily, Star Trek Beyond is much more than a mere refresh. Thanks to Lin’s steady directorial hand and knack for visualizing improbable set-pieces, the new film is bold, breathless and propulsive, a distillation of the action movie to its purest elements."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"The latest, produced by Abrams and directed by ""Fast and Furious"" alum Justin Lin, isn't quite up to the 2009 and 2013 movies. But it's still fun, you still care about the people and the effects manage to look a little more elegant and interesting than the usual blue blasts of generica."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"This episode cuts right to the core of the series’s original appeal, giving the terrific cast a chance to play against one another in a straightforward story. It’s not exactly bold, but “Beyond” does satisfy."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,70,"The film may not go boldly, but it’s a welcome homecoming for the beloved series."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,70,Star Trek Beyond is better than not-bad. By any earthly standard it’s good.
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,70,"Fun but in a careful way, the film lasts just two hours, but it can seem much longer than that."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,70,"It’s a knowing nod to the past fused with a contemporary cast confident in the present, and where the franchise might take it in the future."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,70,"The third instalment of the re-booted Star Trek franchise gets safely through its voyage, offering a strong returning cast and a familiar, if slightly tweaked mix of effects-heavy space action, cheeky humour and philosophical musing."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,70,"It’s a sturdily built movie that gets the job done, and it’s got a likable retro vibe."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,70,"Star Trek Beyond might be the Star Trekkiest film of the new, J.J. Abrams–ified Trek era. That is to say, it's the one that feels the most like a turbo-loaded episode of the original series, and has at least some of that classic spirit of exploration and derring-do."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,68,"Star Trek: Beyond does have a strength that its two reboot predecessors lacked: it puts the focus squarely on the larger Trek ensemble, rather than solely on Kirk and his relationships."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,67,The rebooted Star Trek film series finally hits a fun median between big-budget bombast and classic Trek bigheartedness with Star Trek Beyond.
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,67,"If Star Trek Beyond existed outside the arena of reboots and sequels that mandated its existence, the movie’s casual air might be downright radical for such an extensive production. Instead, it’s just a sturdy riff on the same old routine."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,63,The movie never delivers on its considerable promise because it's always in such a hurry to get to the next action scene.
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,63,"The plot, credited to Simon Pegg & Doug Jung, is pure Trek. Unfortunately, it’s also instantly forgettable."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,63,"There is plenty in Star Trek Beyond for diehard Trekkers to enjoy, and director Justin Lin (Fast & Furious) guns the action sequences."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,63,"Stark Trek Beyond emphasizes the inter-personal dynamics of the USS Enterprise, and functions best as an extended team-building exercise."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,63,Pandering? Yes. But pandering with polish.
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,63,"The galactic adventure might be an uneven one, but the combination of gravitas, a little mirth and old-school Trek themes makes Beyond a decently entertaining trip to the final frontier."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,60,"The nerd in me wants a bit more rigor, a bit more plausibility underneath the exuberant fakery. Maybe in the next episode."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,60,"In fairness to Beyond, it makes very few promises it can't keep, but also goes halfway out on every limb it can find, risking next to nothing."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,60,"Justin Lin proves a safe pair of hands at the helm of the Enterprise. Powered by a spirited sense of adventure and a nice teamwork dynamic, it’s fun, but not essential, summer viewing."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,60,"This new movie could arguably have given Elba more to do, earlier in the picture, but it is the inter-relationship of the Enterprise’s crew which is the real source of drama. An entertaining adventure."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,58,"Beyond is more fun than deep. It’s lightweight, zero-gravity Trek that is, for the most part, devoid of the sort of Big Ideas and knotty existential questions that creator Gene Roddenberry specialized in."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,50,"Freed from reality, Lin turns into a kid gifted a box of markers and glitter: Everything is manic and distracting. There’s a cool swoosh where the lens surfs behind the Enterprise as it accelerates through a tube, but mostly the tricks are garish."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,50,Action scenes are so chaotically edited it’s often difficult to figure out who’s bashing and crashing into whom.
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,50,"With Star Trek Beyond, the rebooted “Star Trek” franchise that features the original crew of the Enterprise, settles into routine sequel territory. This isn’t terrible news, and it may have been inevitable, but it’s something of a letdown all at the same."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,38,They should have called it “Star Trek Into Drowsiness.”
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,30,"Lin’s F&F films are operatically dumb, which was what makes them so much fun; maybe if Star Trek Beyond were stupider it wouldn’t feel like such a chore."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,20,"If you go out into the furthest reaches of Star Trek's filmography today, you're in for an unsettling discovery: the final frontier looks oddly familiar. It's brightly coloured eye-bait, Jim, exactly as we know it - outpacing your visual field in an attempt to convince you that something exciting is going on."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,90,The best kind of summer blockbuster -- the kind that makes you immediately crave a sequel.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,90,"It's a rich, impressive comic-book fantasy -- easily the summer's best ""blockbuster."""
X-Men,7.4,157299717,90,"The film's strength and its entertainment lie in John Myhre's production design, its generally appealing cast...and, perhaps most importantly, a canny degree of self-parody."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,90,"For diehard fans, X-Men is full of in jokes and sly references -- For everybody else, there's the thrill of the unknown."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,88,"Balances brains, brawn and heart in ideal proportions. The actors - some first-rate, all enjoyable - never get overshadowed by the special effects, which dazzle us without gory excess."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,85,"One of this year's most dazzling entertainments, not to mention one of the best comic-book movies ever made."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,83,"Singer deftly crafts a sleek, unusually tight film that balances comic-book adventure, pulp opera and the fear of being different."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,80,"When it comes to stoopid fun, X-Men could be the summer movie to beat."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,80,"Exciting mainly because anything can happen and does, the movie drags a bit as it approaches a climax set atop the Statue of Liberty."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,80,"While X-Men doesn't take your breath away wire-to-wire the way ""The Matrix"" did, it's an accomplished piece of work with considerable pulp watchability to it."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,80,"A distinctively absorbing entertainment, offering just enough popcorn thrills for mass audiences and just enough chewiness for hardcore sci-fi fans."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,"The most enjoyable piece of pop fantasy of the summer; sleek, elegant, exciting and wildly, outrageously imaginative."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,A solid action story with inventive battles (one on the Statue of Liberty) and satisfyingly gooey special effects.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,Spectacular special effects and sets.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,"Doesn't match up against the new millennium martial artistry of ""The Matrix,"" nor do the special effects - but he knows how to establish characters and relationships."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,This feast of fantasy is worth it.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,X-Men flies to the rescue with superheroes who have real substance.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,"Loaded with fine performances, traffics in audacious images and generally comports itself with a great deal more grace and gravitas than most movies with roots in fantastic themes."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,70,Nearly the perfect balance between straight-faced pulp action and amused wonder at the outlandish world of comic books.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,67,The film's greatest strength lies in its ability to view itself as a modern moral fable of sorts.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,63,"Recedes to a string of mere action exploits. These are proficiently executed but, for all their visual authority, not much more than routine."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,63,"I started out liking this movie, while waiting for something really interesting to happen. When nothing did, I still didn't dislike it; I assume the X-Men will further develop their personalities if there is a sequel."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,63,A mixed bag with the promise of a better sequel.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,60,Plays like a so-so middle chapter of an epic series rather than a fitting kickoff.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,60,"Stylish, exciting and an occasionally poignant sci-fi adventure spectacle."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,50,"The mood is awfully dark for an escapist fantasy, though, and the high-tech mayhem gets repetitious."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,50,A very odd cinematic creature.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,50,"Missing are well-choreographed action scenes, likable characters and involving plot twists."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,50,"Clumsy when it should be light on its feet, the movie takes itself even more seriously than the comic book and its fans do, which is a superheroic achievement."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,50,"When the film version isn't assaulting you with gizmos, it's an awkward, depersonalized piece of hackwork."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,38,Superhero comic book movie with a script so feeble it might have been written with crayons.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,20,"An ambitious, frustrating drag."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,10,"Isn't juvenile, it isn't even infantile. It's prenatal!"
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,80,"Watching Apocalypse, you don’t feel as if every character is being set up for his or her own spinoff. They complement one another. They need one another. The overflowing ensemble nature of the enterprise is the whole point."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,80,"This film nimbly mixes narrative exuberance and emotional depth, flamboyant displays of power with quietly terrifying exchanges. It zips along, combining the highs and lows of a real comic book – all the feeling, color, and wonder, even some of the dopiness – with gloriously cinematic storytelling."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,80,"Once again, it's Evan Peters' Quicksilver who steals the movie whenever we see his powers in action, maybe because they've found a unique way to showcase them. There's even a fun but unnecessary tangent involving another popular ""X-Men"" character."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,75,"This isn’t A-level X-Men, but it’s a visual feast, it doesn’t take itself too seriously, it’s brimming with stellar performances, it has some legitimately moving teamwork segments — and it contains perhaps my favorite scene of any movie this year."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,75,X-Men: Apocalypse is a competently made superhero action film but it’s not a game-changer and its brand of action seems a little too familiar.
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,75,"Neither resting on formula nor audience goodwill, the “X-Men” series is going deeper and getting better as it goes along."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,70,"The X-Men adventures keep getting bigger, but Singer works extremely hard to ensure that, even when they’re not always better, they continue to thrill sufficiently."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,67,"Much of what makes X-Men: Apocalypse legitimately interesting also makes it frustrating and lopsided, since Singer and screenwriter-producer Simon Kinberg remain committed to the structure of an overlong comic-book blockbuster, complete with a climax in which the world has to be saved using as many different colors of energy beam as possible."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,67,"I enjoyed the energy of the film, and the cast is pretty solid throughout, but there’s a big problem that is inherent to the idea that we have to make these films bigger and bigger to outdo things that have come before."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,67,"Apocalypse, for all its faults, has the audacity to make the MCU look small, and the conviction to make the DCU — if there even is such a thing — look foolish for confusing self-seriousness with gravity. If only these characters were allowed to be as complex as the ideas they fight for, Apocalypse could have represented a new beginning for superhero cinema."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,63,"Director Bryan Singer, who started the whole thing in high style with 2000's ""X-Men,"" returns for a fourth time. Singer shows a lot of energy, but he and screenwriter Simon Kinberg (Fantastic Four, yuck) let the movie get way overcrowded."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,63,"At times, “Apocalypse” can be great fun, even if it doesn’t know when to hand its car keys to a friend and ask to be taken home."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,63,"The action, aside from the cloudy 3D, looks impressive (particularly the destruction of the Sydney Opera House), and X-Men: Apocalypse moves along tidily, but you watch thinking that all this used to be a lot more fun."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,63,"When we have to spend time with Beast and Angel and Nightcrawler and Cyclops and Psylocke and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence, still strong), the movie too often becomes a parade of cameos. Apocalypse has no personality, merely the malevolence of a megalomaniac."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,63,"This ninth installment in the Marvel mutant superhero franchise is rife with urgent and (dare we say?) apocalyptic comings and goings, with characters and confrontations that seem at once familiar and befuddling."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,63,The issue with X-Men: Apocalypse is that Bryan Singer suggests so many possible directions to go in and still chooses the least interesting one.
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,60,"For deeply steeped Marvel Comics aficionados it will probably be fairly satisfying, and there’s no reason on earth why anyone else should even bother."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,60,"Disorganized but engaging, full of visual pyrotechnics and earnest emotion, it is diverting, if not necessarily convincing."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,60,"The biggest X-Men movie yet doesn’t scrimp on carnage, but lacks the heft of Singer’s previous instalments."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,60,"The idea of an apocalypse means every dial has to be turned up to 11 and this film certainly provides bangs for your buck, although there is less space for the surreal strangeness of the X-Men to breathe, less dialogue interest, and they do not have the looser, wittier joy of the Avengers. But the more playful episodes with Cyclops and Quicksilver are welcome and everything hangs together."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,58,"Some of the franchise stalwarts, such as Jennifer Lawrence’s Mystique, are given too little to do. Most are given too much."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,58,"X-Men: Apocalypse is sprawling to a fault, in both geography and characters to be given something to do."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,58,"There’s a same ol’, same ol’ wash to X-Men: Apocalypse that wasn’t quite as apparent in the previous two entries."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,50,"It’s a goofy, confusing mess of a sequel, a cautionary tale of what happens when a filmmaker lives too long inside his own franchise to realize that no one takes it nearly as seriously as he does."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,50,"Mostly, though, it’s the same old story: Bad mutants versus good mutants, with the fate of us humans — mostly off-screen, disturbingly expendable — hanging in the balance."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,50,"For every lively moment, there’s a reminder that the franchise is tiring."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,50,McAvoy and Fassbender appealingly reprise their frenemy chemistry. But Lawrence has little to do but look perplexed.
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,50,"Point is, the property is running on bald tires, and, for all its ear-splitting racket and lavish effects, “Apocalypse” is the barest of retreads."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,50,"It feels flat, disjointed, with too many moving parts."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,50,"Apocalypse never rises from the sum of its parts, becoming another bloated summer spectacle that rides the rail between fan service and coherent story. You can probably guess which side it eventually crashes on."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,50,"Director Bryan Singer made more hay with Marvel’s mighty mutant menagerie in the early 2000s, but the new film comes undone with too many characters and not enough nuance or freshness."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,50,"The epic effects, titanic struggles and ever-evolving line-up of characters of ""Apocalypse,"" coming hot on the heels of “Civil War” and “Batman v. Superman” and “Deadpool,” underline the exhausted ingredients of the formula these movies all use. The filmmakers strain to find something new to do with them, and watching them try too hard is wearying."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,50,"13 years later, the X-Men are bigger, and the effects used to bring their powers to life are even more convincing. But what’s missing at this point is that sense of awe and wonder from those early days. For all the fighting and blasting and bamfing, we’ve seen it all before — sometimes literally."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,50,"This one’s no gem. It’s simply large, and long (two-and-a-half hours, the usual length lately with these products). I remain unpersuaded and slightly galled by the attempts to interpolate the history, locale and tragic meaning of Auschwitz into what used to be known as popcorn movies."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,50,"Apocalypse feels like a confused, kitchen-sink mess with a half dozen too many characters, a villain who amounts to a big blue nothing, and a narrative that’s so choppy and poorly cut together that it feels like you’re watching a flipbook instead of a movie."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,46,"Not all superhero action films need the MCU's banter or Deadpool's smarm. But you can't play a symphony with a single note. With Apocalypse, Singer never gets around to varying his single, gloomy, dreary tune."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,42,"While not a disaster, it would be fair to say it is somewhere between “disappointingly serviceable” and “embarrassingly pointless.”"
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,42,"Apocalypse feels like a cog in Fox’s perpetual-motion blockbuster machine, paying lip service to the story’s allegorical potential as it grinds our interest to dust."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,40,"The problem is that Apocalypse's highlights feel like moments of serenity amidst two-and-a-half-hours of lumbering, inconsequential chaos."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,40,"Better than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, but not by an awful lot, and vastly less entertaining than Marvel’s current Captain America smash, it’s also curiously more sadistic, and seemingly less bothered about large-scale human fallout, than this once-spirited series used to be. Apocalypse isn’t quite the end of the world for X-Men fans, but it might be the end of the line."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,40,"Although the X-Men ensembles are usually large, there are simply too many characters for the action-heavy “Apocalypse” to properly juggle."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,40,"Messier and heavier than Days Of Future Past, this is not so much the next step in the X-Men’s evolution as a failed callback to past glories."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,40,"X-Men: Apocalypse provides a hint at what might one day take down the ubiquitous superhero genre: utter dullness. For all its bangs, the movie is ultimately a whimper."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,40,"There are no memorable action scenes—the closest we get is a virtual rerun of the time-freeze sequence from the previous movie. And the script is just nonsense, comprised entirely of sarcastic asides, portentous gobbledygook (""The dawn of a new age will rise!"" cries Isaac) and insider references that only the faithful will appreciate. Unless that’s you, it’s best to steer clear."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,40,"Despite the undeniable presence of a huge amount of action, X-Men: Apocalypse is decidedly a case of more is less, especially when compared with the surprising action and more interesting personal interactions (including the temporary subtraction of some characters) in other big Marvel franchises."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,30,"The previous episode, “X-Men: Days of Future Past,” was as fresh and enjoyable as this one is semicoherent and dispiriting."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,30,The movie’s top-flight cast is left in ridiculous positions.
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,155442489,25,"X-Men: Apocalypse is a confused, bloated mess of a film."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,88,Snow White and the Huntsman reinvents the legendary story in a film of astonishing beauty and imagination.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,80,"I resisted this derivative mishmash of classic fairytale and modern epic fantasy for as long as I could, but ultimately it swept me up into its geeky but manly embrace and carried me away on a white charger."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,78,"Ambitious, brutish, ruthlessly unromantic – has the right idea casting its heroine as a Joan of Arc-type crusader and its evil queen a dissertation (albeit first draft) on beauty as the most direct path to power for the disenfranchised female."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,75,"Attempts to inject a little humor via the antics of the dwarves don't work, especially since one of the little people is killed early in the proceedings. No one's going to be singing ""Hi ho! Hi ho! It's off to work we go!"" after that happens."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,75,"Yes, there are many splendid reasons to see Snow White and the Huntsman – enough, maybe, not to care that neither Snow White nor the Huntsman rank high among them."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,75,"A surprisingly fine, fantastic movie it is."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,75,"This is a violent film. It's rougher, in fact, than ""The Hunger Games."""
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,It is an absolute wonder to watch and creates a warrior princess for the ages. But what this revisionist fairy tale does not give us is a passionate love - its kisses are as chaste as the snow is white.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,"An evil spell nearly does Snow White in, but it's lifted in the nick of time. The strangest spell afflicts Kristen Stewart; she can't seem to imbue Snow White with anything more than a semblance of feeling. That spell never lifts, but it doesn't make much difference in the end because the forces of good manage to work around it."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,"Though it is an ambitious - at times mesmerizing - application of the latest cinematic technology, the movie tries to recapture some of the menace of the stories that used to be told to scare children rather than console them."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,"Rare among the recent fairy tale adaptions (from ""Mirror Mirror"" to the dreadful ""Red Riding Hood"") the invigorating Snow White and the Huntsman actually breathes new life into an old story."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,"Never quite delivers on its promise -- a dark retelling of the fairy tale in which women hold the true power, good and evil -- but it certainly is an attractive misfire."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,The movie's revisionist tone is startlingly enough to carry you along.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,67,"If you've a mind to see a classic fairy tale rendered as an action movie, and if you want to see a sizeable handful of fine English actors have grand fun playing grizzled dwarves, there are worse ways to spend two hours than in the company of Snow White and the Huntsman."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,63,"The nearly two preceding hours often feel like three, as the patchwork script keeps introducing characters and subplots and dropping them, all while rushing characters through eye-popping environments."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,63,One of those movies that makes for a fantastic trailer. Much beyond that can feel like repeat viewing.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,63,Snow White and the Huntsman is definitely a missed opportunity. Sanders was on to something in taking the Snow White tale to its most menacing extreme.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,63,Just feels like it was made from the pieces of every fantasy-action movie ever made.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"The CGI effects are so slick that they undercut the movie's shock value, and the action moves too quickly to instill a real sense of fear, but this is still visually impressive, with spectacular make-up, costumes, and cinematography."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"It's Theron who owns this film, imbuing her deliciously depraved Queen with furious pain and deep-seated fear."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"Why can't heroines just be heroines anymore, instead of micromanaged personalities who may as well have the words ""Role Model"" tattooed across their foreheads?"
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"It's hard to imagine who will thrill to this violent, gorgeous, and empty film."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"The rousing speeches and booming battle scenes are all well done as far as blockbuster spectacle goes, but you can't help but feel the filmmakers' resistance to the story's grimmer undercurrents."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"A strong visual style tussles with flaccid storytelling in this ambitious retelling of Grimm. It won't exactly have Walt Disney spinning in his secret ice chamber, but you may wish they spent more time worrying about what exactly the film is than who it's for."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"A visually inventive, deliciously dark fairytale reheat. The story's far from the stuff of legend, but Theron makes for a ferocious meanie, helping to flush away ""Mirror Mirror's"" sugary aftertaste."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,58,"Some of the fairy tale effects are marvelous; but the odyssey from darkness to light is unduly long and sloggy, and Stewart, with her contemporary edge, seems to be acting in the wrong era."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,58,A tastefully overbearing franchise fairy tale with a handful of ravishing touches.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,50,"I spent several minutes not caring what was happening with the story but just observing the patchwork illusion of oversized props, short stunt doubles and computer grafting of big faces on small bodies. Nice work."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,50,A bold rethinking of a familiar old story and striking design elements are undercut by a draggy midsection and undeveloped characters in Snow White and the Huntsman.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,50,"Handsome but hollow, Snow White & the Huntsman is easily among the stranger additions to a roster of rebooted fairy tales."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,50,"As feminist fantasy, the film is non-committal, and as a reimagining of the fairy tale, it's at best expensive-looking without seeming wantonly so."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,50,"For all this Snow White's visual ornamentation, there's no sense of narrative priority - the filmmakers can't see the Dark Forest for the trees."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,45,"What dooms Snow White and the Huntsman is ultimately not how over the top it is, but how dull it is."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,42,"There are complicated elements at work here, with threads of curdled vengeance, victim entitlement, and insanity bound together in ways it would take a much smarter film to unravel. Snow White And The Huntsman doesn't try, and the film just keeps getting dumber as it goes along."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,40,The result is tangled and overblown.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,38,"In Snow White and the Huntsman, this talented but woefully miscast actress (Stewart) is expected to rally an entire army of soldiers, even though she usually looks like she forgot the combination to her locker."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,30,"Snow White and the Huntsman, the first feature from British commercial director Rupert Sanders, has its work cut out for it if it wants to be a truly dull piece of junk - but it manages."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,25,"Suffers from a problem in its rhythm. It's not that its pace is too slow, but that it's too regular, and this lack of syncopation makes it feel slow."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,25,"Overlong, overcrowded, overstimulating and with an over-the-top performance by Charlize Theron as the evil queen Ravenna, the movie is a virtual orchard of toxic excess, starting with the unnecessarily sprawling cast of characters."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,75,Quite literally the blockbuster of the year.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,75,"The CGI effects in this film, directed by Brad Peyton, are quite remarkable and help take one’s mind off the cornball disaster-brings-families-together underpinnings."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,75,"By turns frightening, exciting and ridiculous, San Andreas is, in the end, more impressive than anything else."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,75,"Starting with a mountainside rescue setting up Ray's bravery, through cities ruined and a tsunami leveling San Francisco, San Andreas is gnaw-your-knuckle fun. Which is the roller coaster conflict that comes with the disaster movie genre, the closeness to horrific reality that attracts millions yet repels a sensitive few."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,75,"There are really no surprises here. But the action is bracing, Johnson’s performance is solid and, within its extremely narrow parameters, entirely convincing, and Gugino and Daddario are both gritty and attractive. The result is a pretty exemplary popcorn movie."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,68,"There are big, loud entertainments like “Mad Max: Fury Road” that I find myself enjoying even with my critical-thinking cap on, and then there are movies like San Andreas that somehow go straight to my lizard brain; this movie’s dumb, and its portrayal of urban devastation borders on the pornographic, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t entertained."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,67,"San Andreas shows that sometimes the fake stuff can get the job done beautifully. I don’t want to make any claims that San Andreas is a great film. It’s not. But as mindless sensory barrages go, its fakery taps into something real: It shows us just how impotent we all are to control our planet. Unless, of course, you happen to be The Rock."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,67,"The reason you go see San Andreas is to see what the state of the art looks like when you destroy an entire state, set piece after set piece, and Brad Peyton delivers on that."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,67,"It’s obvious from the start what’s going to happen, and although San Andreas occasionally makes some interesting moves (the swift offing of a character who pops up simply to be annoying is one of them), it’s mostly a paint-by-numbers affair bolstered by jaw-dropping CGI and a desire to completely flatten as much cityscape as possible."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,63,The special effects and especially the 3-D are top-notch.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,63,"I enjoyed large chunks of San Andreas, largely because the actors give it a full load of sincerity, and there's some bizarrely effective comic relief thanks to Hugo Johnstone-Burt and Art Parkinson as Brits who picked the wrong week to visit the Bay Area."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,63,What sells this formulaic corker of Apocalypse Porn is the cast.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,60,"The allure of San Andreas rests entirely on the calibre of its pandemonium, savored, ideally, with a brawling audience on a Friday night. Indeed, it is the kind of movie that makes me want to campaign for the serving of alcohol in leading cinema chains — mandatory beer, I propose, with shots of Jim Beam to toast the dialogue."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,60,"You see San Francisco and Los Angeles falling apart very loudly and dangerously, and in great computer-generated detail. But there’s nothing memorable or beautiful about the carnage; no specific moments to replay in your head once the film is over."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,"There are things in San Andreas that no one would have dreamed of seeing 40 years ago, when ""Earthquake"" (with its tacky, plaster-cracking “Sensurround”) represented the state of the art. But nothing means anything. The spectacle feels less earned than Dwayne Johnson’s biceps, which are ludicrous but not hollow."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,"Between its steroidic CGI and emotionally vacant plot line, the movie is all flex, no muscle."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,It's an orgy for disaster porn devotees.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,"Considered as pure spectacle, San Andreas is gripping and effective."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,The cringeworthy dialogue and unmoving earnestness are the biggest disasters in this mostly forgettable action flick.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,"The dialogue in San Andreas is lame, its plot both predictable and implausible, and the character development beside the point. Even Dwayne Johnson, that force of cinematic nature and rock-ribbed charisma, doesn’t have enough charm to dig this mess of a movie out of the rubble of cliche it’s buried in."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,"San Andreas doesn’t have much interest in the lives lost during its sequence of catastrophes, but it does dole out plenty of the large-scale spectacle that matters in disaster films of this type."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,"Handsomely shot by Steve Yedlin, Rian Johnson’s regular cinematographer, and boasting a typically likable Dwayne Johnson as its star, San Andreas nonetheless struggles to drum up tension or interest, even as skyscrapers topple like Jenga towers and massive tidal waves sweep through San Francisco Bay."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,The movie is at its strongest when it integrates family dynamics into the plot rather than indulging in extreme couples therapy.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,40,"Even by the non-Olympian standards of the disaster genre, San Andreas is chock-full of cliché characters, staggering coincidences and wild improbabilities."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,40,"Campy but never campy enough and far too numbingly artificial to ever drum up any real suspense or sense of awe, the film has a scale that's squandered on visual witlessness."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,40,"San Andreas' whirlwind of action and devotion to the disaster movie playbook will satisfy those looking for a loud, effects-filled ride. Those inspecting it any closer will find a cookie cutter studio blockbuster which stretches disbelief to its limits."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,40,The very earnest human drama fits awkwardly into the action and isn’t helped by some unconvincing performances and weak dialogue.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,40,"After providing some blissfully stupid B-movie thrills for its first hour, the film suffers from spectacle overkill."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,40,The cast’s likeable work falls right through the script holes.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,40,"If you crave Emmerich-esque disaster-porn with a mega body count, there’s plenty here to OMG at. But when it comes to character depth or plotting, San Andreas is a sadly familiar wasteland."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,38,"There's nothing to keep the pulse alive after the first quake. Peyton throws in a second quake and a tsunami, but after a while buildings tumbling into the ocean are just a bunch of pixels turning everything into visual mush and leaving audiences in a digital stupor."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,38,"In Brad Peyton's San Andreas, the biggest earthquake in recorded history is less natural disaster than divorce negotiation process."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,38,"Oblivious to both narrative logic and the laws of physics, the cliché-filled San Andreas doesn’t nearly have the star power of earlier, better disaster movies it borrows from like “The Poseidon Adventure,” “Earthquake” and “The Towering Inferno.”"
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,33,It’s hard to stay connected to a disaster film where the biggest disaster is the script.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,30,San Andreas changes all too quickly from satisfyingly foolish to dismayingly dumb to genuinely stupid.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,30,"The purpose of San Andreas is not to make us think, but to make us gape, to pummel us with effect and effect until we finally give in. Fair enough. Uncle. I need a Tylenol anyway."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,30,The most disturbing thing about this may be how dull and routine it seems. Computer-generated imagery can produce remarkably detailed vistas of disaster — bridges and buildings collapsing; giant ships flung onto urban streets; beloved landmarks pulverized — but the technology also has a way of stripping such spectacles of impact and interest.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,30,"San Andreas can't wait for the carnage. The problem is, it's too chicken to ask us to comprehend it. It's all big, distant, unfathomable wreckage -- all shattering skyscrapers and rippling cityscapes -- with no sense of the human cost."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,25,Run! Run for your lives! Get out of this theater now! Two hours is a terrible thing to waste!
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,25,"This is pure Disaster 101 formula, although distilled to the minimum amount of dialogue and characters possible."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,20,"San Andreas is a disaster — literally. That’s not to take a piece out of Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson. His charm and family-man-style fearlessness as the movie’s star is the only saving grace in this thuddingly repetitive, badly written crash-a-thon."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,20,"San Andreas, by its very nature, begs, borrows, and outright steals from other, occasionally better, disaster epics."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,75,"It's done with an agreeable confidence and flair, the actors all fit comfortably in their roles and the effects are fun."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,75,"Blessedly unimportant, Fantastic Four cruises along on modest yet genuine comic-book pleasures."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,70,"A funky, fun film version of the famous Marvel superhero concoction, one of the earliest of the revisionist wave of supes and in some ways the most lovable or at least the most knowable."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,63,"Frustrating because it doesn't seem far removed from a wholly enjoyable motion picture, but the tempo's off, beats are missed, and the production ends up sounding out-of-tune."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,63,"I don't think it will seriously disappoint longtime fans, but it made me itchy as I watched it unfold in ways that the comics never did when I read them in the '60s."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,63,"In a summer of low movie expectations and worse results, Fantastic Four is a not-so-bad mindless bit of camp escapism that doesn't try to eclipse its dime-store comic book roots."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,60,"Michael Chiklis (of the cop show ""The Shield"") steals the movie as the agonized Thing."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,"This clumsy, cheesy, chintzy adaptation, with its F/X that look dated the moment you see them, is like something left over from the '60s."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,"A wildly uneven, sporadically slapdash action-adventure that amuses in fits and starts."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,"This ""Four"" ain't so ""Fantastic."""
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,"Even if you can get past the acting -- and in the case of the beautiful, blank Alba, that's asking a lot -- the film just sits there, not exactly torturous, but never very exciting, either."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,"It's fun to watch superheroes who aren't quite at ease with their abilities, but ""The Incredibles"" - last year's similarly themed animated film - is livelier and funnier."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,"Fails to be anything more than a mild summertime diversion. Based on the Marvel comic book, it's a prototypical air conditioner movie."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,There's nothing terribly fantastic about this ho-hum futuristic foray.
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,"It's a waste of classic material. Rent ""The Incredibles"" and see what should have been."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,"Fantastic Four doesn't expand on, or even illuminate, anything much beyond the most basic theme of what it feels like to be an adolescent misfit. This is a comic-book movie that actually makes an effort not to go over kids' heads."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,A garish mediocrity.
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,40,"A comic-book movie unashamed of its roots, meaning it's unabashed about being silly, overwrought nonsense, which works to its benefit--so much so that you're almost rooting for it by the end."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,40,"Compared with the psychological probing and spiritual brooding of ""Batman Begins,"" Fantastic Four is proudly dumb, loud and inconsequential."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,40,A colossal snore.
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,40,Favors light action over character dynamics.
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,40,The release of Fantastic Four marks the beginning of the end for movies based on Marvel Comics' upper tier of characters.
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,40,"After this mediocrity, no one's even going to remember Roger Corman's godawful bargain-basement 1994 version. Which, on second thought, had a lot more heart that this one."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,40,"Fleetingly enjoyable in very short bursts, this is the most cynically constructed event movie in recent memory, its heart purely in its wallet. A fantastic bore."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,38,There's nothing remotely fantastic about this Fantastic Four.
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,38,"It needed a star like Clooney at its center, and a character actor like Alan Rickman as Dr. Doom. You don't expect realism from a comic-book movie, but you do want the characters to seem larger than life."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,30,"Directing seems an unduly elegant term for what Hollywood hack du jour Tim Story (Barbershop, Taxi) does here -- the action scenes are so choppily constructed that their excitement disappears faster than the Invisible Woman."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,30,"An overinflated B-movie with no grace, no subtext, no wit, and featuring beefcake/cheesecake actors who look like they've been plucked from the soaps."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,30,"The action sequences reek of drudgery rather than adventure, and with the exception of Chiklis's remarkably soulful performance beneath 60 pounds of orange Thing makeup, all of the characters are flatter than their two-dimensional counterparts."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,30,"The really good superhero movies, like ""Superman,"" ""SpiderMan 2"" and ""Batman Begins,"" leave Fantastic Four so far behind that the movie should almost be ashamed to show itself in the same theaters."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,25,"A perfect storm of wooden acting, hackneyed direction, inane scripting and laughably cartoonish special effects produces a shapeless mess more wearyingly stupid than arch-villian Dr. Doom is evil."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,25,What the movie lacks most is a real sense of adventure.
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,25,"They take on special powers that the filmmakers are incapable of making interesting, partly because the characters are ciphers, and partly because the story is listless and uninventive."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,25,"From less a purist's standpoint than a seeker of serviceable junk food, this comprehensive waste of time is too bouncy to be an ""Elektra"" bummer, but should make Marvel mascot Stan Lee think twice about burning another lucrative bridge with unintentional hilarity."
Beverly Hills Cop II,6.5,153665000,80,"Aside from the plot -- and if you can figure out the plot, the CIA's special projects unit wants to talk to you -- Cop II is a rarity: a sequel that's as good as the original, if not better."
Beverly Hills Cop II,6.5,153665000,75,"The new film has at least some of its predecessor's appeal. But it can't match the first film's novelty, or recapture the excitement of watching a great comic character like Axel Foley as he first came to life."
Beverly Hills Cop II,6.5,153665000,63,"There is an inherent problem about any sequel that too slavishly duplicates the style and substance of its predecessor; it cannot deliver the delight of discovery that the original provided. Axel made a swell first impression, but he is still living on it, perhaps not yet a bore, but not quite as fascinating as he once promised to be."
Beverly Hills Cop II,6.5,153665000,60,Part 2 seems even more like a Stallone vehicle than the first movie. I'm not even sure it's intended as a comedy. It's filled wall to wall with the kind of routine action and violence that Hollywood extrudes by the yard and shrink-wraps to order.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,75,"The Rise Of Cobra holds to a thrill-ride sensibility that’s unchallenging and more than a little goofy, but exciting and consistently well-managed."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,70,"While thesping is not the main game here, having a cast of bright young things certainly helps, and Quaid gets in a few nice John Wayne-like moments as the no-nonsense boss."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,70,"The loudest, flashiest, silliest and longest blockbuster in a summer full of long, silly, flashy, loud blockbusters (long and silly ""Transformers,"" flashy and loud ""Wolverine"")."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,63,"A brazen, earsplitting, eye-popping, oddly satisfying action extravaganza, though it veers wildly off-target in its second hour."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,63,"A loud but proficient slab of explode-o-rama summer blockbuster nonsense, perfectly entertaining if you like that sort of thing, extremely skippable if you don't."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,63,"This movie’s sole purpose is to make teenage boys high-five each other, and it’s faithfulness to that concept makes the cartoon carnage almost endearing."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,60,"The action is mostly brisk and bracing and the battleground, particularly Cobra's headquarters -- a vast network of tunnels under the polar ice cap -- are wonderfully imagined, as are the futuristic machines at the Joes' disposal. Basically, the Joes are not bad, it's just that they could have been much better with a little less conversation, a little more action."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,50,"It's hard to deny that the first two-thirds of G.I. Joe is an enjoyable film, especially when graded on the curve of lowered expectations. Compared to other big-budget movies out this summer, it's pretty mediocre."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,50,"G.I. Joe may not be beefier, but it’s cheesier and less aggravating than ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,""  the summer ’09 headbanger it most resembles."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,50,"Unlike it's ""Transformers"" cousin, the story is appealingly straightforward, and the movie is chock-a-block with breathless action sequences."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,50,"Chock full of high-tech action, with a lot of chasing and shooting and explosions."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,50,The plot feels both familiar and far-fetched.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,40,"Bond without the style and Team America without the bellylaughs. The moronic script and nonsensical plot are good for a snicker, though."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,38,"Certainly better than ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" How so? Admittedly, it doesn't have as much cleavage. But the high-tech hardware is more fun to look at than the transforming robots, the plot is as preposterous, and although the noise is just as loud, it's more the deep bass rumbles of explosions than the ear-piercing bang of steel robots pounding on each other."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,38,More toy commercial than movie.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,30,"The only collateral damage is in the audience, where, as you sit through the movie, you can feel your IQ drop minute by minute."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,30,"After nearly two hours of nonstop mayhem, the film ends on a surprisingly muted note, though pains have been taken to make sure that the hoped-for sequel has been carefully set up."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,30,"After a first hour that plays like a bad TV show, Sommers hits his groove with an over-the-top Paris chase sequence that, in turn, leads to an underwater finale that’s absurdly overproduced, momentarily diverting, and then instantly forgettable."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,30,"Loud, shiny, and critic-proof, this franchise launcher is basically Transformers minus the humanity. Dennis Quaid provides some ballast as grizzled patriarch to the troop of sexy young lock-and-loaders."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,25,"Don't go expecting an escapist night at the movies; go expecting to be cudgeled into numb, drooling submission."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,20,"G.I. Joe was not screened for critics, but that’s not because of its mindless action and nonsensical plot. It’s because G.I. Joe is the kind of movie that bludgeons the viewer into submission with its loud and constant barrage of sound and fury."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,12,"Formerly a real American hero, G.I. Joe is no longer a hero (it's a group) or American. (It's a multinational team of military superstars, though the way it does business, you'd feel safer with the Croatian navy on your side.)"
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,12,"I don't know what to say about the acting, writing and directing in G.I. Joe because I couldn't find any."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,10,"There's a way to do this kind of thing (Just witness Hasbro's other toy-turned-dumb movie franchise, ""Transformers""). G.I. Joe, though, hasn't got a kung fu-grip on what it is."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,10,"This pricey, juiceless pulp could never have been killed by critics, simply because it was already dead."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,88,The strength of Burger’s movie is the fact that a non-reader of Roth’s work can enjoy Divergent and not be confused by any aspect of the storyline.
Divergent,6.7,150947895,83,"While Burger, Daughtery and Taylor skimp on the characters’ interior lives, they do make some surprising improvements on the book."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,83,"Woodley, through the delicate power of her acting, does something compelling: She shows you what a prickly, fearful, yet daring personality looks like when it's nestled deep within the kind of modest, bookish girl who shouldn't even like gym class."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,75,"Director Neil Burger (“Limitless”) has crafted a popcorn flick that’s leaner, more propulsive and more satisfying than the bestseller that inspired it."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,75,"Divergent is less action-oriented than ""The Hunger Games"" but no less compelling."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,75,"What about those who haven’t read the book? Divergent, the movie, still offers a smart, spunky, sympathetic heroine, a hunky love interest and a sobering if rather obvious message about the value of being true to oneself rather than mindlessly conforming."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,75,A sequel needs to hit the ground running faster than Divergent does. Find more notes for Woodley's elegantly plain face to express.
Divergent,6.7,150947895,67,The ultimate irony is that a series predicated on diverse individuals rising up against totalitarian regiment falls so completely in lock step with all other post-apocalyptic young-adult franchises.
Divergent,6.7,150947895,67,"Because there’s some genuinely great ideas in the film, and some terrific character work, but it’s given such uneven attention, alternately languished upon and glossed over, that the portrait Burger creates feels complete without, well, making us feel a whole lot else."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,65,"Over-plotty, convoluted, full of unanswered questions and unquestioned assumptions — is a big part of the problem here, but director Neil Burger (“Limitless”) pulls off a neat trick here, in that Divergent is a pretty diverting piece of moviemaking pulled from a not-especially-good story."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,63,"Woodley, though, by virtue of the sheer likability of her presence, keeps you hanging on, keeps you rooting for her."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,63,"Despite two strong lead performances and a welcome dose of female empowerment, this somber tale feels too familiar and formulaic."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,60,"Loyal to the novel, but welcoming enough for newbies, Divergent does a decent if not jawdropping job of bringing its dystopian world to life."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,60,"Smart, tough and a little bit cool, this is an intriguing opening rather than a slam-dunk in its own right, but the cast - and especially Woodley - make it sufficiently diverting to merit a place in the action franchise ranks."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,60,"If you can forget what it’s saying, Divergent is fairly entertaining."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,60,"It's an acceptable, play-it-safe version of the first volume in the hugely popular Veronica Roth-written trilogy."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,"At almost 21/2 hours, Divergent is repetitiously brutal and drab, with sets that resemble warehouses and industrial junkyards; the action rarely emerges into the daylight before the climactic gun battle."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,"Woodley makes Tris easy to root for — only she and Winslet seem to be having any fun — but it's hard to become invested in the convoluted, rambling story. And at two hours and 19 minutes, it rambles for a while."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,"Divergent is almost good enough to make you forget what a cynical exercise it is on every possible level. The original 2011 young adult novel by Veronica Roth — reasonably engrossing, thoroughly disposable — reads exactly like what it is: an ambitious young author’s attempt to re-write “The Hunger Games” without bringing the lawyers down on her head."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,"This society makes no sense except as a metaphor. The social layout of Divergent was supposedly devised so as to maintain peace, but putting people into airtight factions guarantees conflict."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,"At 140 minutes, Divergent is too bloated to be consistently exciting, but it’s relatively agile between its many exposition-dumps, at times resembling an actual action movie more than a pro-forma adaptation."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,"The bestselling first book in yet another dystopic Young Adult series, Veronica Roth’s Divergent is engrossing enough to devour overnight, and flimsy enough to forget by morning light. Neil Burger’s film adaptation faithfully reproduces the same effect."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,The generic bulk of Divergent hits its marks and moves on.
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,"Divergent is a clumsy, humorless and shamelessly derivative sci-fi thriller set in a generically dystopian future."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,"Divergent, the latest outcast-teen-battles-The-System thriller, is similar enough to “The Hunger Games” that hardcore Katniss fans may dismiss it. But it’s a more streamlined film, with a love story with genuine heat and deaths with genuine pathos."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,The film transcends the déjà vu of its borrowed trappings but ironically sacrifices all momentum in favor of a long series of physical tests.
Divergent,6.7,150947895,45,"Director Neil Burger, whose last divergent character was the smart-drugged protagonist of Limitless, allocates more than enough of this overlong movie to details of life and society in future-Chicagoland. But he fails to make any aspect of the premise persuasive."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"The more you scrutinise the society Roth and these screenwriters have created, the more it seems a chintzily self-designed dystopia whose rules and entire infrastructure are pure cardboard."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"How Orwellian is college? Very, if Divergent is to be believed."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"One would be better off experiencing Woodley via her heartbreaking turn in last year's ""The Spectacular Now,"" a drama that actually has more to say about nightmarish cliques and individuality than any lackadaisical slide into future schlock."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"For a film that supposedly celebrates freethinking, there’s a woeful lack of it here."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"Too bad this would-be heir, Divergent, is so unimaginative and bland."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"Ms. Roth’s prose style is good enough and Tris appealing enough that, at least in the book, it’s easy to breeze past the plot holes. It’s harder to ignore those flaws in the movie, partly because the director, Neil Burger (“Limitless”), gives you little to hang onto — beauty, thrills, a visual style."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"It'd be easier to root for lead Tris's (Shailene Woodley, the go-to girl for drab roles with grit) quest to escape her Abnegation roots and those ghastly gray skirts to prove herself a worthy Dauntless if director Burger felt committed to the concept."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"Director Neil Burger struggles to fuse philosophy, awkward romance and brutal action. Even with star Shailene Woodley delivering the requisite toughness and magnetism, the clunky result is almost unrelentingly grim."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"By trying to cram in as many explanatory info dumps as possible, Burger neglects to tend to the elements of the film that could easily make up for any narrative deficiencies: namely, a sense of place and a feeling of urgency."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,38,"Except for Kate Winslet's fearsome turn as a villain, the only terror Divergent roused in me was that the drag-ass thing would never end. Sorry, I'm a Candor."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,20,"In all candor, and with all the amity I can muster, Divergent is as dauntingly dumb as it is dauntingly long."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,83,"If you accept that Rambo is not the same kind of movie as First Blood and watch it on its own merits, it’s a badass action movie."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,75,"It may be a dishonest, xenophobic, exploitative act of historical revisionism, but it's effective, and Jack Cardiff's cinematography lends Rambo's comic-book adventures an epic sweep."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,75,"The body count is rising, Sly's pecs are blowing up, and Rambo himself is becoming more of a brand-name than a character, a mascot for masochism and murderous self-assertion."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,60,"The charade on the screen, which is not pulled off, is to accept that the underdog Rambo character, albeit with the help of an attractive machine-gun wielding Vietnamese girl (Julia Nickson), can waste hordes of Vietcong and Red Army contingents enroute to hauling POWs to a Thai air base in a smoking Russian chopper with only a facial scar (from a branding iron-knifepoint) marring his tough figure."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,60,"Here is a film fully xenophobic, abhorrent film, touting guileless version of military honour, but with Jack Cardiff’s furtive camerawork and some excellent editing, it sucks you in to its disturbing heroic sweep."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,50,Rambo is an inane sequel to a fairly good melodrama; another example of an attempt to repeat an earlier success that goes wildly out of scale.
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,50,"To anyone who doesn't share the camera's adoration, this sort of behavior becomes so comic that Rambo turns into something of a camp classic."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,50,"The picture seems deliberately trite, blunt, and manipulative, as if the producers didn't trust their audience to respond to anything else."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,40,"All in all, it's a pretty offensive movie, especially to the Americans who fought in Vietnam."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,90,"Here's a picture that you actually want to see a second time, not for the sake of further wrapping your head around its gnarly conceptual matrix, but because of the sheer visceral charge it provides. Here, at long last, is a summer movie -- like its precursors in the Terminator canon -- worth its weight in cybernetic organisms."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,90,"This movie doesnt cop out. It doesnt go for fake, feel-good warm fuzzies, and its not for the faint of heart. Terminator 3 has guts. It has a LOT of guts. And its a rare thing for any movie  whether its a summer blockbuster or an indie arthouse flick  to have guts."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,90,"T3 delivers the goods. A hard-hitting, straight-ahead sci-fi actioner with none of the pretentions and ponderousness that have put at least a portion of the public off of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Hulk."""
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,88,"The effects in ""T3"" are spectacular, and the action sequences -- particularly the fights between the good and bad terminators -- are exhilarating."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,83,"With him (Schwarzenegger), we return to a franchise we never knew we missed, surprisingly grateful for the star's generosity -- and evident pleasure -- in strapping on the old sunglasses and blasting adversaries to hell."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,80,"An expertly paced and efficient sci-fi thrill machine, ""T3"" effectively marries impressive action sequences with persuasive storytelling and its star's uniquely appealing style of ""No"" drama -- as in no reaction, no expression, no emotion of any kind."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,80,"Tried hard to honor the spirit of the franchise, not exploit it, and take it to a new level and a surprising destination."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,78,"Reality has overtaken the movies here, which, I suppose, makes T3 all the more cathartically appealing. At least onscreen we have Arnold Schwarzenegger in our corner."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"It puts almost everything it has into its explosive set pieces, but manages to instill the audience with just enough emotional involvement. If, Ah-nold decides to come bach again, this installment should ensure he has an audience."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"Though this film doesn't have the novelty value of the first or the complex plotting of the second, it boasts the most spectacular single sequence."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"Gets the most bang for its buck by letting the camera linger on the spectacle, and allowing tension, not flashiness, to be its hallmark."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"May lack the mythic pow of the 1984 original and the visionary thrill of T2, but it's a potent popcorn movie that digs in its hooks and doesn't let go until an ending that ODs on apocalyptic hoo-ha."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"This is easily the funniest of the Terminator movies (although not, it should be stressed, the lightest). It is also the shortest and most compact."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"In a summer of comic book super-operas dense with psychological torment and sprawling well over two hours, the unpretentious efficiency of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is refreshing."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"Against all odds this ""Terminator"" deserves to be welcomed back."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"This third installment is the loudest, dopiest, and least inventive of the three. But what the movie...lacks in intelligence it makes up for in sheer doom."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,Pedestrian but appealing.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"At its screeching, wall-breaking best, T3 achieves heavy-metal slapstick."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"T3, while far from a classic, is an overachieving, mercenary sequel that's short on thrills, but surprisingly long on laughs and surprises."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"Overall it's reasonably thrilling anyway. If you're hoping for a brilliant revisionist take on the franchise, forget it."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"At its metallic heart, T3 is another chase movie -- one figure relentlessly tracking three others, mostly in cars, at high speed through implausibly underpopulated Los Angeles streets."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"Lacks the wonder, surprises and supercool attitude Cameron achieved.  ""T3"" is no weak sister, though. With Arnold Schwarzenegger back as the iconic title character and an often witty, fast-paced script by John Brancato, Michael Ferris and Tedi Sarafian, audiences worldwide will embrace the new film."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"As an action film it roars forward with agreeable, transporting energy."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"That's not to say Terminator 3 is terminally awful -- just banal, merely humdrum, more conventional horror flick than science-fiction myth, and a whole lot less than what came before."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,67,"Terminator 3 moves at not-quite-breakneck speed, and the shape-shifting, metal-melting special effects aren't exactly spectacular."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,63,The good news is that Schwarzenegger is more entertaining than ever as the Terminator T-101 cyborg.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,63,Is Terminator 3 a skillful piece of work? Indeed. Will it entertain the Friday night action crowd? You bet. Does it tease and intrigue us like the earlier films did? Not really.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,63,"Less about the characters than about the first two movies, whose best scenes it congeals into ritual or parody."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,63,"I dont mind the movies retro-ness, but I wish Mostow didn't take pulp so seriously."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,60,"Picking up some 10 years after the previous film left off, this stripped-down, intelligently conceived follow-up is a respectable conclusion to the Terminator trilogy."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,60,"Where Judgment Day exhibited the profligate sprawl of a military operation, the leaner, less grandiose Rise of the Machines has the feel of a single Hummer careening through an earthquake in downtown Burbank."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,60,"For all the hype and the inevitable box office bonanza, Terminator 3 is essentially a B movie, content to be loud, dumb and obvious."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,60,"If none of this seems particularly fresh, you're right. ""T3"" is strikingly similar to ""T2"" and ""T,"" reflecting Hollywood's reluctance to tamper with a hit series."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,60,"The villain comes back more times than Wile E. Coyote. I found it tiresome and witless and numbingly repetitive, but action mavens won't feel cheated."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,50,"Has its moments, and Schwarzenegger is as buff and tough as ever. But there's a flat feeling about this effort that's unmistakable and inescapable."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,50,"Unfolds as a thrilling piece of entertainment, but it has a third act and ending that dont work and shouldnt ever work."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,50,Begins promisingly and entertains for a stretch because you think it's leading to something more than one of the movie year's flattest conclusions.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,50,Wastes no time getting very loud and very silly and never really lets up.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,50,Pointless and mind-numbing.
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,88,"Thanks to Banderas and his Corinthian leather purr and writers who know how to use it, ""Puss"" is the best animated film of 2011."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,80,It's always a pleasure to find a family film that respects its audience all the way up the line.
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,80,"A treat to experience visually (especially in lively 3-D) and verbally, Puss in Boots is a family film where the adventure and invention never flag and the tongue-in-cheek humor doesn't linger far behind."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,80,"A perfectly diverting romp that happens to showcase some of the best 3D work yet from a mainstream animated feature. Colorful, clever enough, free of cloying showbiz in-jokes, action-packed without being ridiculous about it and even well choreographed."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,80,The results are so funny and irresistible audiences are bound to be swept away into this kitty's universe.
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,75,"Puss in Boots is essentially non-stop dazzling action scenes loosely connected by a thin, predictable story of greed versus good."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,75,"For a kids' movie, the humor, at times, strays a bit too far into grown-up territory."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,75,The story has just the right blend of child-centered silliness and winking adult humor.
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,75,"Even if they don't provide much lift, these boots were made for amusement."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,75,"Puss in Boots isn't particularly deep, nor does it take itself seriously -- it just wants to seek glory, win affection and cash in. Done, done and done."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,75,"The movie has a devilish wit that works for parent and child alike, and it moves like a bobsled. It's funny and fun, and if it's not up to Pixar level, it still represents the best of what the competition has to offer."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,75,"Puss in Boots doesn't have and doesn't strive for the soul of a Pixar film, but gets pleasure enough out of its own characters and the way they move through this cleverly realized world."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,70,"Puss has his charms, but he is not as memorable a character as Shrek or Shrek's mouthy sidekick, Donkey. Consequently the story, which involves a quest for magic beans and golden eggs, feels improvised and diffuse."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,70,A surprisingly delightful adventure romp.
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,70,"However crass the motivation for its existence, Puss' origin story could easily stand on its own -- a testament to clever writing on the part of its creative team and an irresistible central performance by Antonio Banderas."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,67,"The seductive interplay of Banderas and Hayek, the barely recognizable vocal contributions of Galifianakis, and the Southern backwoods speech of Thornton and Sedaris all keep us attuned to the events on the screen."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,60,"Like most kittens, it's not always perfectly behaved, but at least this new Puss adventure doesn't have you reaching for the cinematic spray bottle. And thank goodness the spin-off does nothing to neuter the charismatic cat's appeal."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,60,"Puss made his debut in ""Shrek 2,"" then did time in the two decreasingly funny sequels. Now he's got a movie of his own, and not a moment too soon."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,58,"As a sheer visual experience, Puss In Boots makes a great theme-park ride, a thrill-a-minute feast for the eyes and the semicircular canals."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,50,"All in all, the 3-D animations wow without gimmickry, Banderas purrs without peer - and it's a cheerful movie."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,50,"Puss in Boots is beautifully animated (with 3-D that adds nothing), but the film is so mindlessly busy that it seems to be trying to distract you from the likable, one-note feline swashbuckler at its center."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,50,"For all the fuss, it dissolves almost immediately upon contact."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,40,"The pomo thrill was already wearing thin a few ""Shrek"" entries ago; here, the reliance on self-referentiality really risks coming off like yesterday's Purina."
Puss in Boots,6.6,149260504,38,Relentlessly mediocre cartoon.
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,90,"But no, Lethal Weapon 2 is no artless, autopiloted waste of precious movie-theater air conditioning. It's fun stuff -- crackling, playfully escapist summer fare that doesn't make you feel taken advantage of later."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,88,Lethal Weapon 2 is that rarity - a sequel with most of the same qualities as the original. I walked into the movie with a certain dread. But this is a film with the same off-center invention and wild energy as the original.
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,83,"In the wake of Lethal Weapon, producers across Hollywood had started running the buddy-cop concept into the ground, which made 1989’s Lethal Weapon 2 a reminder of how to do this schtick right, with just as much emphasis on loose character interaction as on violent action."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,80,"Lethal Weapon, that BMW of buddy movies, spawns Lethal Weapon 2, a blacktop-blistering bad-guy-getter that's nearly twice as much fun."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,80,"Before it skids out of control in the final sequence, the film is so careful to preserve its successful comic-action formula that it follows the most basic law of sequels. If you liked ''Lethal Weapon,'' you'll like Lethal Weapon 2; it's almost as simple as that."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,80,"Loaded with the usual elements, Lethal Weapon 2 benefits from a consistency of tone that was lacking in the first film. This time, screenwriter Jeffrey Boam and director Richard Donner have wisely trained their sights on humor and the considerable charm of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover's onscreen rapport."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,80,"The movie overall may be routine, but Donner gives it some spark and polish."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,80,Unlike most sequels Lethal Weapon 2 is neither predictable nor conventional. It's just pumped full of juice.
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,75,"But while the story may not be especially memorable, Jeffrey Boam’s brisk screenplay and Donner’s workmanlike direction keep things moving enough to gather enough momentum in preparation for Gibson’s third-act, tear-down-the-house rampage."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,75,"Returning director Richard Donner seems to have smoothed over the few stylistic rough edges remaining from the earlier film to deliver here two hours of pure, breathless, high-impact entertainment."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,75,"If there is one thing that I've learned from Stephen Spielberg, and George Lucas it's that the easiest way to win an audience is to employ an antagonist that everyone hates, like the Nazis, or Stormtroopers. Producers Richard Donner and Joel Silver take a lesson in the first sequel to Lethal Weapon and pit Gibson and Glover against fascist dimplomatically-immune South Africans."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,75,"By concentrating on the often frustrating, funny relationship between the three men, the film gains in humour but loses some of the momentum and panache which distinguished the original."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,100,This improbably magnificent film and Michael Giacchino’s majestic score are a perfect match.
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,100,"War for the Planet of the Apes may have the body of an action film, but it has the soul of an art-house drama and the brains of a political thriller."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,100,"Reeves keeps the action moving steadily, never letting the film’s 140 minutes feel even slightly bloated, and surrounds Caesar with a visually stunning, compassionately conceived group of side characters."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,100,"There is a scene toward the end of War for the Planet of the Apes that is as vivid and haunting as anything I’ve seen in a Hollywood blockbuster in ages, a moment of rousing and dreadful cinematic clarity that I don’t expect to shake off any time soon."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,100,It would be hard to overstate just how singular this picture feels in its seriousness of purpose and in its cumulative power to enthrall and astonish.
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,100,"The effects are incredible, the action is exciting, the music is great, and Andy Serkis, once again embodying a non-human character through motion-capture technology, remains terrific. But there’s something more here."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,95,"War for the Planet of the Apes is an excellent closing act to this rebooted trilogy, but also one that does enough world-building that the series can potentially continue from here – and it’s a rare case where, after three movies, we’re left wanting more."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,91,War for the Planet of the Apes seals Caesar's place in the pantheon of movie messiahs and the trilogy's place among the finest ever.
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,91,"War for the Planet of the Apes is a formidable conclusion (if indeed it is) to one of the more well-considered modern series to date. This is a film of difficult, lingering questions and painful revelations."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,90,War for the Planet of the Apes is the rare blockbuster that’s both entertaining and full of complexity.
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,90,"War for the Planet of the Apes is a formidable achievement: not just the rare last chapter in a trilogy that maintains the high quality of the first two, but a visually lush, heart-pounding summer action movie that dares to ask hard questions about the struggle between good and evil—both on the larger social scale and within each individual—and the fate of life on Earth."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,90,"The cast is all top-notch. Harrelson can peel and eat scenery like a bunch of bananas, but he’s mostly in control here. Andy Serkis is beautifully intense as Caesar, and Steve Zahn a welcome addition as the scaredy-cat Bad Ape."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,90,"It’s engrossing every inch of the way, with casualties, infighting, character flaws, war mongering, and some delicious grandstanding from Harrelson."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,89,"A glorious, action-and-pathos packed capstone to the rebooted Apes franchise."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,88,War for the Planet of the Apes marks the apex of what has been a bludgeoning season of spectacle cinema.
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,88,"This is a vital, original, and emotionally potent chapter to one of the longest-running movie series out there. It will easily be one of the summer of 2017’s best films and, at the end of the year, it will likely find a space on many respectable Top 10 lists."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,88,"Reeves achieves visual wonders even in the stillness before all hell breaks loose. It's what makes War for the Planet of the Apes such a unique and unforgettable experience – that, and Serkis's career-high performance. Hail Caesar, indeed."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,88,"Gripping, visually assured and working far above its summer-sequel paygrade, War for the Planet of the Apes treats a harsh storyline with a solemnity designed to hoist the tale of Caesar, simian revolutionary — the Moses of apes — into the realm of the biblical."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,88,"Serkis is brilliant and memorable and sometimes absolutely heartbreaking as Caesar. The supporting players excel, with each getting a moment or two in the sun."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,88,"While it may be a few beats too long, especially in its multiple endings, it’s a shockingly memorable movie, the kind that gets better as you dissect and discuss how much it does right after the lights have gone up. And, let’s not forget this important factor for summer movie dollars, it’s wildly entertaining."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,88,The satisfying and heart-wrenching climax is a last reminder that Caesar’s new adventure is one of this summer’s best.
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,83,"The film could have been improved by dropping a few battles, and I wish Caesar were not the only ape with the power of human speech. I, for one, would love to hear what Maurice the orangutan sounds like spouting the King’s English."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,83,"Like Caesar and company, the films seem to be getting more intelligent and human as they evolve."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,83,"Brimming with emotional intelligence, the human texture Reeves delivers in Apes separates his film from the rest of the tentpole pack."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,83,"With War for the Planet of the Apes, technological wizardry and first-rate storytelling combine into a bracing action-adventure that concludes the best science fiction trilogy since the original trio of “Star Wars” movies."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"Foregoing breadth in favour of depth, War is at its core a character study disguised as a science fiction epic."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"This movie takes big risks, and many of them pay off. War for the Planet of the Apes proves that big movies aren’t incompatible with big ideas."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"Flawed but impressive, War for the Planet of the Apes finds its place comfortably, and near the top, of a surprisingly satisfying summer season. It’s a smart take on the old films, making this a series that can stand alone in its own right."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"The monkey business is somber, brutal and utterly persuasive in this dazzling third entry of a sci-fi series that's only getting better."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"It’s not going to change the summer-blockbuster landscape single-handedly, but at least it comes by its thrills honestly: This is a spectacle that trusts us to think."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"The fact that a genre entry of this nature, with no intrinsic need of being philosophically nuanced, goes out of its way to endow even its ostensible villains with comprehensible motives rates as a notable achievement."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"The conflict here is one of morality, identity and the boundaries of humanity; all the guns and napalm, while present, are secondary to War’s purpose."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"Reeves marshals more than his fair share of battle scenes and sweeping set-pieces, but never forgets the flicker of a face can provide all the spectacle that cinema requires."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"It’s an engrossing, forthright adventure."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,"Apologies to Charlton Heston loyalists, but War for the Planet of the Apes is a good example of how today’s movies sometimes beat the hell out of the oldies."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,"In the new film, War for the Planet of the Apes — the best of the series, by far — the series’ viewpoint comes into focus, and it’s a lot more intricate and enlightened than some unthinking death wish."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,"War for the Planet of the Apes plays like a mash-up of about five different movies, but at least one of them feels like a masterpiece."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,"The contributions of the actors now blend more seamlessly with the animation to create digital characters, and the characters are being integrated more successfully and believably into the landscape — director Matt Reeves works on a big widescreen canvas of sweeping, picturesque exteriors."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,"What we’re left with in War for the Planet of the Apes is an absorbing, intelligent finale. The film builds to an ending that, although not particularly surprising, feels appropriate—even inevitable—considering all that’s come before."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,"Serkis again proves that in the highly specialized realm of performance-capture acting, he has no peer."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,"The end result is too boxed in by the demands of the franchise era and the usual restrictions of a PG-13 rating to qualify as art. It can’t show morally troubling violence or embrace hopelessness, and its day trip into the heart of darkness has to end with a ray of sunshine—“The horror, the horror...” in quotation marks."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,It’s not just the CG that’s visually impressive here; “War” boasts some extraordinary set pieces.
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,The psychological wars that have made the prequels simmer with tightly wound tensions are given their most cutting treatment yet.
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,70,"The main problem with War for the Planet of the Apes is that, although it rouses and overwhelms, it ain’t much fun."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,70,"While War for the Planet of the Apes's third act is a bit hairy, the sequel helps cement the franchise as one of the more exciting mainstream properties worth watching."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,60,"This solid if unspectacular finish to the Apes trilogy features an A-game Andy Serkis and incredible VFX, but its darker excesses threaten to suffocate at times."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,58,"War of the Planet of the Apes has all the bombast and sense of finality seemingly required for the end of a trilogy, but there’s an underlying emptiness that nags with each scene."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,50,"War for the Planet of the Apes manages to be both alienating and sappy, and the biblical finale seems to come from a different universe altogether. It’s an awesome, dull movie."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,50,"To me, it’s just another “Jurassic World,” technology and production design on a whole new plane, story, dialogue and characters that we’ve seen before (too often), the entire hyped and over-rated enterprise half-forgotten before it hits Netflix."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,50,"It’s fitting that the visual effects have advanced so dramatically since 2011, as it allows the series to suggest that its ape protagonists have evolved to an equivalent degree, and yet, “War’s” story is beneath their intelligence."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,90,"After undergoing some unfortunate mutations in recent years, a beleaguered Marvel movie property gets the smart, stylish prequel it deserves in X-Men: First Class."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,88,"In this cheerfully perverse origin tale of Magneto, Professor X and their mutant team, Vaughn delivers a fireworks display of action, smarts and fun, plus a touch of class from actors who can really act."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,88,"Most of the actors live their roles, and Fassbender (Rochester in the last ""Jane Eyre"") is superb as the wolflike, undisciplined assassin."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,83,"McAvoy and Fassbender are a casting triumph. These two have, yes, real star magnetism, both individually and together: They're both cool and intense, suave and unaffected, playful and dead serious about their grand comic-book work."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,80,"It's not the artistry of X-Men: First Class that's particularly striking; though it's finely crafted, the film feels less the product of a visionary director than of the Marvel movies machine working at maximum efficiency."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,80,"This prequel draws new energy from supersmart casting, plus the shrewd notion of setting the beginnings of the X-Men saga in the early 1960s."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,80,"Audacious, confident and fueled by youthful energy."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,"At least Erik/Magneto, as played by Michael Fassbender, is, well, magnetic."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,"That's partly why X-Men: First Class is such fanboy fun, as the script departs from official Marvel lore to invent a whole new ""origin story"" for the mutant ensemble."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,"This X- Men is indeed first class: an exciting, bold and thoroughly enjoyable summer blockbuster."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,First Class happily delivers on the escapism and rich narrative texture the best of its predecessors have promised.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,"Fassbender plays Magneto as a supercool assassin with a completely understandable set of beefs. I spent most of the movie rooting for him, and would watch a ""Magneto, 1960s Nazi Hunter"" sequel in a second."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,Another crowd-pleasing comic-book film designed to bring in new fans while gratifying the old ones.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,An uncommonly polished and sophisticated superhero movie.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,"Director Matthew Vaughn, who did last year's delightful ""Kick-Ass,"" doesn't do witty this time around, but he does keep up a spiffing pace while making the action blaze."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,"Perfectly fine summer folderol, epic enough on its own terms if not quite big enough to expand beyond its genre and matter to people who find it difficult to care about characters who spit gobs of flaming phlegm. I realize there are fewer and fewer of us, but we're a hardy band and stubborn."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,"X-Men: First Class still sings the praises of Marvel Studios' marvelous quality control of comic book movies. It's good, clean summer movie fun where the money they spend is up on the screen - with actors and effects - so that we won't mind spending our money on it."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,70,"So while X-Men: First Class at first takes its source material with just the right amount of self-deprecating seriousness, it founders in the second half, when it becomes overburdened with squirrelly plot mechanics and an excess of self-evident dialogue."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,70,"With its spy-on-spy globetrotting, old-fashioned villains, flirty but prematurely swinging minis and fan-boy bits (look for an eye-blink-fast tribute to ""Basic Instinct"" and a cameo from the cult actor Michael Ironside), the whole enterprise has an agreeable lightness, no small thing, given its rapidly moving parts."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,70,"X-Men: First Class isn't anywhere close to being a genre classic like ""Spider-Man 2"" or ""The Dark Knight,"" but it is good enough to rejuvenate a franchise stuck on idle."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,70,"What the film does well, however, is grasp the tone and rhythm of the original comic books."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,67,"It's all vastly superior to Brett Ratner's scorched-earth ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" of course."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,63,The easiest way to summarize my reaction to X-Men: First Class is with a shrug.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,63,"X-Men: First Class is a mutant movie, half fun and half fearsome. For those who have developed an immunity to fanboy hype, the contradictory traits may seem to weaken rather than strengthen this beast, but readers of the ""X-Men"" comics will hail an origin story as satisfying as ""Thor."""
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,63,"An elaborate origins story with more datelines than an issue of Condé Nast Traveler (Oxford! Miami! Argentina! Poland!), X-Men: First Class has some fun trying to explain how Professor X, Magneto, and all those mopey mutants came to be."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,63,"X-Men: First Class is competent weekend entertainment. It is not a great comic book movie, like ""Spider-Man 2,"" or a bad one, like ""Thor."" It is not in 3-D, which is a mercy."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,63,"Still, the deadliest single element in this film can be traced not to Bacon's character, but to composer Henry Jackson, whose music seems determined to kill us all with waves of dramatic nothingness."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,60,"Like Bryan Singer's X2 (2003), this fifth entry in the X-Men franchise is noteworthy for its gay-rights subtext and for its noted actors delivering comic book dialogue with Shakespearean portent. Otherwise it's indistinguishable from most other recent blockbusters."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,60,"It's big, bright, savvy, and so expansive you'll undoubtedly leave feeling you got your money's worth."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,60,"All you'd expect from an X-Men film (or spin-off, or prequel), but not all you'd hope for. It smacks of rush and compromise, but there's thankfully enough to make you feel optimistic about the series' future once more."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,50,"Uneven, occasionally silly, true, but it's also an improvement over 2006's ""X-Men: The Last Stand."""
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,50,These ludicrous but endearing moments of bro-bonding are all that sets this otherwise stock-issue superhero movie apart from its mass-produced brethren.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,50,I was startled to look up the running time and discover that X-Men: First Class is only 104 minutes; the second half is so clunky it feels much longer.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,40,Too bad that First Class torpedoes its lofty intentions with flights of idiocy so wrongheaded as to be almost endearing.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,40,It's just another franchise nonstarter to toss in the superstore superhero deal bin.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,40,A tedious two-plus hours. There were such possibilities in the origins idea.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,38,"Despite his apparent comfort with F/X-heavy projects, the obligations of duty to the brand are too much for Matthew Vaughn's strange, singular voice, which rarely has the chance to shape the film unmolested by a curiously bland script."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,30,"A cameo from an old-school X-Man only serves to remind how stylish and witty the first installment was a decade ago. Lacking a single memorable joke or striking image, First Class is as perfunctory and passionless as would-be franchise resurrections get."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,100,"Director James Cameron always works on a mega- canvas, yet he's brought off something unique here."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,90,Much of the appeal of True Lies comes from the smooth grafting of battle-of-the-sexes comedy onto a high-tech action picture.
True Lies,7.2,146282411,88,One of the best things about True Lies is that it's genuinely funny.
True Lies,7.2,146282411,88,"On the surface, True Lies is an affectionate homage to James Bond movies, ratcheted up to meet the action/adventure expectations of today's audiences."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,83,True Lies is so eager to give you a giddy good time that you're more than happy to let it work you over. It's a likably disposable pop cocktail.
True Lies,7.2,146282411,80,"The net result is unbeatably good fun, helped along by that inherent fantasy that one man can create global mayhem without stopping to worry who's going to clean up afterwards."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,80,"The director, James Cameron, is a master of action (he worked with Schwarzenegger on ""Terminator 2""), and when he's doing his thing, no one does it better."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,75,"The comedy is extremely broad (with Curtis eliciting almost as many laughs as Schwarzenegger), the action sequences are as well crafted as one can expect from Cameron, and the meaning is as root basic as anyone would wish."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,70,This mixture of comedy and super-agent spectacle works well at first. But when Schwarzenegger's family and working worlds link up -- an inevitable development -- the plot becomes increasingly ridiculous and overwrought.
True Lies,7.2,146282411,70,"The catch is, once you get past the stunning special effects and the mind-numbing stuntwork, there's not all that much there."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,60,"Deceptively labeled a domestic epic by writer-director James Cameron, the $100 million movie is, in fact, a weird hybrid of action juggernaut, buddy cop caper and reactionary soft-core pornography."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,50,For a viewer sympathetic to Schwarzenegger's and Cameron's best selves -- the ironist with muscles and the mordant fabulist -- True Lies is a loud misfire. It rarely brings its potent themes to life.
True Lies,7.2,146282411,50,"Yet even with its ribald laughs and spectacular action sequences (clearly seeking to up the ante on the latter front), the movie gets mired in a comedic midsection that wears the audience down, sapping their energy before the film shifts to a chaotic third act that just doesn't know when to quit."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,50,"The tale begins and ends in a flurry of joke violence; Cameron has decided to spoof what he used to take seriously, and the result, though bright and deafening, feels oddly slack -- he loosens the screws, and our interest drops away."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,90,"Fabulous mental escape. It's fun and playful, rather than dark and foreboding. And there doesn't seem to be an original cyber-bone in the movie's body. But it's put together in a fabulous package."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,88,"The perfect sci-fi movie for a post-9/11 world, in that it tells us we're afraid of threats hiding in plain sight."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,88,"This is a movie to restore the faith of those who had given up on science fiction after ""The Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions."" By adeptly combining action and ideas, it proves that Hollywood can still produce astonishing entertainment."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,80,"The effects, arguably the best of the year, only add to the thrill."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,80,"Once this movie gets going, it works, and it works well. It has a slow buildup, but its final third manages to generate some eye-popping thrills."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,80,"Smith makes it look easy, but underneath the physical high jinks and slick veneer of I, Robot lies a performance of real discipline and intelligence."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,75,It's a high-tech thriller that really works.
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,75,"Less ambitious than ""Blade Runner"" but more coherent than ""Artificial Intelligence: A.I.,"" which it vaguely resembles, I, Robot is best during homely moments when Smith shows his human side."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,75,For its first two acts this flashy vehicle is an anodized titanium streamline baby. Then comes a robot rumble that brings the action to a crashing halt.
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,75,"Although I, Robot provokes thought, it doesn't exactly deliver thought, despite the occasional Cartesian reference to ""ghosts in the machine."""
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,75,"Moves along with great speed and verve, and it's got just enough of a sci-fi sheen to make things interesting, if not provocative. Philosophers and true believers may be disappointed, but for movie fans, I, Robot mostly delivers the goods."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,75,"Hollywood's umpteenth tale of robots run amok is surprisingly smart, cool-looking, nicely paced and well-acted."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,75,"A summer action movie that has a brain and doesn't let it atrophy? Fan me, I'm fainting!"
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,70,"It's much more of an action flick than either ""Metropolis"" or ""Blade Runner,"" but there's a provocative and visionary side to this free adaptation of Isaac Asimov's SF classic that puts it in the same thoughtful canon."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,67,"A routine Will Smith cop-on-the-hunt thriller at heart, I, Robot lacks imaginative excitement."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,67,"It dares to test the audience in several ways: It may not be Asimov but its plot is truly labyrinthine, it works a specific theme (the very real possibility that robots will evolve on their own) and it's happy to end itself in a shroud of enigma."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,67,"Proyas does a jaw-dropping job, particularly in the opening scenes, of depicting Chicago in the year 2035."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,63,"A movie of its kind and of its time -- functional, professional, slickly manufactured and slouching toward consciousness -- I, Robot is a perfect slave to mechanical convention."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,63,"A slick, shiny video game of a movie bursting with computer-generated chase scenes and cool gadgets."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,60,"Lacks both the intellectual rigor and the soulful sublimity of ""A.I.,"" but it nonetheless allows some genuine ideas and emotions to pop up amid the noise and clutter."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,60,"While not a classic by any means, is still a mostly entertaining experience."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,60,"Although Sonny is computer generated, Tudyk supplied his voice and body language -- provides the story's emotional core, an irony Asimov would surely have appreciated."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,60,"In the end, I, Robot is just an assembly-line product of a not very advanced model."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,60,"A cluttered, awkward blockbuster that's just smart enough to get itself into trouble."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,Proyas creates a futurescape that's snazzy in a Blade Runner lite sort of way and one or two of the film's effects are eye poppers.
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,Proyas merely assembles a mess of spare parts from better movies.
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"Performances, plot and pacing are as mechanical as the hard-wired cast."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"A humans vs. robots saga that feels machine-made, I, Robot looks to have been assembled from the spare parts of dozens of previous sci-fi pictures."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"It walks and talks and moves very fast, but it never lives."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"The film works best as a kind of mindless, action-packed B-movie. But on the A-level at which recent science fiction/fantasy films operate -- meaning the ""Spider-Man,"" ""Harry Potter"" and ""Terminator"" series -- this movie falls woefully short."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"A stylish, watchable, very familiar future-cop action thriller. What was once original is now almost completely derivative."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"The plot is simple-minded and disappointing, and the chase and action scenes are pretty much routine for movies in the sci-fi CGI genre. The robots never seem to have the heft and weight of actual metallic machines, and make boring villains."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"If you subtracted from the story and style components recycled from landmark sci-fi films of Hollywood past, youd be left with Will Smith wisecracking over a box of unformatted floppies.  I, Unimpressed."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"I, Robot strives to be so many things that it ultimately falls away to nothing, a heap of expensive metal parts."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"More disturbing, yet another robot, or maybe two, seems to have written a Hollywood script and hijacked a major studio production. Given the film's assembly-line screenplay and mechanistic storytelling, no other explanation seems viable. Certainly no one with a heartbeat or taste would blow so much talent, time and resources on such rubbishy writing."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,40,"The films accumulation of unnecessary complications, bad visual choices, one completely superfluous character (LaBeouf), and tonally inappropriate quips makes us distractedly ponder the limits of human rather than artificial intelligence."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,40,"If you see it, the sequel will be your fault."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,75,"There are elements in the movie that make it worth seeing, and that set it aside from the routine movies in this genre."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,75,What this sequel delivers is still the kind of high-speed roller-coaster action that producer Joel Silver's films often do so well.
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,75,"Lethal Weapon 3 is all about chases and comedy schtick, and in this case the sum of the parts really adds up to more than the whole."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,75,"If you like fast food movies that you digest and then 10 minutes later forget what you had - or if a simple evening’s entertainment is what you’re after, this will certainly do the trick."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,70,"Lethal Weapon 3 picks up where Lethal Weapon 2 left off, with the same gags and tough-guy dialogue but things are starting to wear a bit thin."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,70,Lethal Weapon 3 isn't that much worse than the two earlier films.
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,63,"The movie zips around without any true forward momentum. The stars carry you along, though."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,60,The third film has way too many moments that push too far toward the absurd.
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,60,"More of the same, but it's now so far removed from any sense of reality, and done with such ham-fisted insistence, it's become a clumsy parody of itself."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,60,"A wham-bam encounter, it gives you everything you (presumably) want, sets itself up for another sequel, and it makes sure you don't recall a thing about it in the morning."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,58,"It's bigger, but it ain't necessarily better."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,58,"More of the same, though a lot coarser than its immediate predecessor, and the characters and situations have now calcified to the point where they're simply sitcom staples."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,50,"Lethal Weapon 3 is pretty much the same as ""Lethal Weapon 2,"" which was pretty much the same as ""Lethal Weapon."""
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,50,"Lethal Weapon 3 offers mediocrity wielded by experts. It's not a movie, it's a machine."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,91,"A singular look, an exemplary vocal cast, and a narrative arc like a caress. That'll be the Kung Fu Panda franchise's legacy, the idea that shouldn't have worked but did, beautifully and with its own chi."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,88,"I think the secret to the appeal of the entire “Kung Fu Panda” franchise is the enormous affection we feel for Po, that seemingly bumbling good guy who also can rise to the occasion and showcase true heroism and mystical power."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,88,"Martial-arts action, excitingly mounted, is all part of the package as Po battles a glowering, green-eyed bull (J.K. Simmons) and tries to whip peaceable pandakind into a fighting force to defeat the villain. One-liners fly as fast as kung-fu fisticuffs in this sweet and satisfying picture."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,88,"It's easy to mistake the simplicity of plot and theme here for simple-mindedness - this isn't Pynchon or Proust. Kung Fu Panda 3 has the economy of a Zen koan, not to mention its inner harmony and wisdom."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"The stakes are upped and character count doubled, but this doesn't mean attention to detail is spared. The visuals are sublime with different animation styles used to tell different stories."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"All the best parts of the movie are transitions and montages, jazzing up the video-game-ish plot with mock-heroic exuberance. The summer ahead is looking madly stuffed with talking animals, but Po has jammed his bulging frame through first, and done it with style."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"Animated with exceptional depth and beauty by co-directors Jennifer Yuh and Alessandro Carloni (and given epic new heft by Hans Zimmer in the orchestra pit), it's a rare ’toon franchise that can grow up so quickly and still giggle at its own butt jokes."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"Rather than the cynical ‘one last grab’ of the series, Kung Fu Panda 3 might actually be the best. Also, and this is so rarely the case that it’s worth mentioning, it deserves to be seen in 3D."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"Mostly, Kung Fu Panda 3 is just fun."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"A beautifully rendered, lovingly constructed action-comedy that's sure to please kids and adults alike."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"Lots of comedic fight scenes break up the story’s more somber stretches, and the animation, especially in 3-D, is simply gorgeous."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"It’s cohesive and cathartic enough to make a fourth entry unnecessary, but at the same time, it’s entertaining and gorgeous enough to make the prospect of same something to welcome."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"Emotionally, dramatically and perhaps most of all visually (it’s worth seeing in 3D), this delightful trilogy capper is almost as generously proportioned as its cuddly warrior hero, restoring a winning lightness of touch to the saga while bringing its long-running themes of perseverance and self-knowledge to satisfying fruition."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,75,"The stunning visuals in DreamWorks Animation’s Kung Fu Panda 3 surpass the high standards set by its predecessors, but storywise, the latest adventures of goofy Po the panda break no new ground."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,75,"Directors Jennifer Yuh Nelson and Alessandro Carloni deploy a gorgeous color palette for the Chinese countryside, using vibrant, swirling shades of green, blue and red for the panda hideaway....The directors also make sure to let Po stay the charming bumbler he’s always been. That’s what makes him such an earnest, lovable hero."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,75,"In spite of its abundant action — and for all the interspecies mashups, this is as much an action-adventure animated movie as it is a funny-animal animated movie — is a pretty relaxing experience for the adult viewer."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,75,Just complicated enough to reward steady viewers and just simple enough for parent escorts to enjoy without much prior knowledge.
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,75,"It finds a benefit in its genre affiliation, evenly distributing its action in quick bursts of fluidly animated fight choreography."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,70,"If directors Alessandro Carloni and Jennifer Yuh don't reinvent the panda-as-martial-artist wheel, they avoid making the story seem stale. The terrific animation helps, of course."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,70,"While the storyline, in which Jack Black’s dumpling-downing Dragon Warrior is reunited with his biological father, doesn’t quite fulfill its prophecies, dramatically speaking, visually speaking it’s all quite impressive — one of those very rare animated features that completely justifies its 3D glasses."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,67,"This is a visually stunning picture, a rhapsody of saturated color and contrasting texture, from the painstaking detail of coarse panda fur to the painterly dreamscape that is the spirit world."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,63,"Like most sequels, it pacifies its core demographic by offering “more of the same.” To that extent, it can be said to be successful."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,63,"The movie's story and cute characters are geared toward the younger crowd, per usual. But while it lacks the wonder and nuance of earlier Pandas, there are enough new faces and wowing, Asian-influenced style to also keep parents amused for an hour and a half."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,60,This is a visually sumptuous kids’ film that will also charm adults.
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,60,"Visually though, Kung Fu Panda 3 is a candy-colored 3-D treat."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,60,"Fitfully amusing and certainly heartfelt, this latest chapter in the likeable animated saga will work best with younger viewers, but its life lessons and emotional beats feel slathered on rather than deftly woven into the storyline."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,58,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is Kung Fu Panda minus a dramatic arc, but with way more pandas."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,50,"From a sympathetic perspective, let me say that sequel No. 3 shows how difficult it is to keep these franchises fresh while remaining true to their initial charm."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,50,"Plays as a franchise out of ideas, out of jokes and more naked about its real place in the film firmament –as panda pandering to the enormous Chinese movie market."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,50,"In Hollywood’s franchise game, sequels are seldom the best they can be. This one isn’t, but it’s pretty, perfectly pleasant and good enough."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,50,A story that builds toward Po training an army of his panda brethren fails to deliver exponentially greater fun.
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,50,"Kung Fu Panda 3 has a moment or two for everyone, but no chance develop any character beyond a single dimension."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,50,The movie undercuts its own undercutting.
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,40,"Once upon a time, Black's charisma might have been enough to carry the movie."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,70,"Deep Impact confines much of its horror to television news reports and has a more brooding, thoughtful tone than this genre usually calls for."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,67,Leder establishes a syncopated rhythm unlike anything we're used to in a catastrophe spectacle.
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,63,"You can enjoy the way they create little flashes of wit in the dialogue, which enlivens what is, after all, a formula disaster movie."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,63,"Deep Impact, a triple-strand ensemble disaster flick, has a few good opening minutes, the biggest tidal wave you've ever seen in the closing minutes, and a cluster of little meandering melodramas in between."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,63,"Unfortunately, an A-list group of actors doesn't mean a lot when there isn't much of a script."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,60,"While the film is flawed, lacks desperately needed humor and is filled with cliches, the attempt to explore the human cost of all those cool explosions and destruction is an admirable one."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,60,"The latest in Hollywood's almost biblical procession of disaster films, Deep Impact tries with moderate success to be more than just the sum of its special effects."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,60,"You may feel safe in your bed, but be warned: even as you sleep, Earth is under threat from a vast, overheated surplus of character actors."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,50,"To its credit, the movie eschews cheap dramatics, but at times it eschews dramatics altogether."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,50,"This Paramount-DreamWorks collaboration, with Stephen Spielberg credited as executive producer, is competently made, strongly focused on its characters' relationships and surprisingly light on special effects."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,50,"The season's first comet-targets-Earth special effects extravaganza is spectacular enough in its cataclysmic scenes of the planet being devastated by an unstoppable fireball, but proves far from thrilling in the down time spent with a largely dull assortment of troubled human beings."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,40,"Deep Impact takes the high road and offers up more tearful reunions than actual fireballs and more egregious, sappy dialogue than you can shake a tsunami at."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,40,"If director Mimi Leder is really guilty of anything, it's of wasting three first-rate actors (Morgan Freeman, Vanessa Redgrave, and Robert Duvall)
 in underdeveloped roles while allowing Leoni's shell-shocked, unconvincing turn to become an embarrassment."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,40,"Deep Impact is the work of someone crass enough, and in some essential way mad enough, to try to turn the apocalypse into a tear-jerker."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,40,"A three-hankie weeper in disaster-movie drag, and its tear-jerking bull's-eyes are separated by long stretches of tedium."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,30,"The film is often unintentionally silly, and it might have been better if it tried to be."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,20,"Michael Tolkin and Bruce Joel Rubin's straightforward script and Mimi Leder's toneless direction make this attempt so boring that the titles counting down the months, weeks, and finally hours to impact are best used to gauge how soon the movie will be over."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,20,"These folks are so blase, you'd think that scientists had predicted pennies from Heaven instead of world's end within the year."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,10,"Mimi Leder shows none of the vigor she exhibited when directing for E.R., and screenwriters Michael Tolkin and Bruce Joel Rubin betray a real 
aptitude for hack work."
Deep Impact,6.2,140464664,10,"For a suspense drama, Impact is a slack, oddly enervated and mawkish soup of largely lethargic performances."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,70,"At the risk of eternal damnation on the Internet, I admit to laughing at -- even feeling momentarily touched by -- Rush Hour 3."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,67,"Ratner, who has been accurately dubbed a ""fauxteur,"" does an OK job keeping the action swirling, especially in the finale atop the Eiffel Tower."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,63,Rush Hour 3 reminds us that Tucker is an utterly strange entertainment phenomenon: He exists only in the world of these movies.
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,63,"By no means is it a great movie, but it is great slapstick fun, one of summer's guilty pleasures."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,60,Chan is still the Gene Kelly of martial arts.
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,60,"Crass, stupid and crudely made. It's also, in places, weirdly brilliant, a picture that plays to the largest possible audience with mechanical efficiency but also, here and there, betrays glimmers of self-deprecating cleverness, as if it were striving, perhaps even unconsciously, to transcend its own dumbness."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,58,It's a jerry-built kick-ass insult machine assembled entirely out of secondhand parts.
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,"In its third time out of the gate, Rush Hour 3, reuniting Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan, hits the ground stalling."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,"The latest picture to feature one of the movies’ oddest crime-fighting tandems nevertheless stays true to the franchise formula of East-West fusion action, broad cultural comedy and international intrigue, this time largely in Paris."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,"Though the movie's a shade shorter than the first two, it feels longer."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,"Once you realize it's only going to be so good, you settle back and enjoy that modest degree of goodness, which is at least not badness, and besides, if you're watching Rush Hour 3, you obviously didn't have anything better to do, anyway."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,"Strangest of all, Roman Polanski shows up to torture our heroes with a Paris phone book, then subject them to a full-cavity search. A gratuitous nod to ""Chinatown""? Who knows? Who cares?"
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,"The best scenes belong to Tucker and director Brett Ratner keys in to his timing, whether it's a Chinese twist on ""Who's on First"" or a seduction scene in which Tucker blurts out every impulse."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,"Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker have been through a lot together. To be exact, ""Rush Hour"" ""Rush Hour 2"" and now Rush Hour 3. Are they tired? Perhaps not, but their antics and action sequences certainly are."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,There's precious little that is fresh or new about the movie.
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,Feels as desperate and static as being trapped in a traffic jam.
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,It's actually surprising that Chan is as engaging as he is. He's a canny performer in a canned-goods movie.
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,"Chan shows he still has the chops during a showdown at the Eiffel Tower, but you'd think the movie's reported budget of $140 million might have bought Tucker at least one side-splitting gag."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,"This may be the best-looking film in the series; certainly, the Paris setting, with a climactic battle among the girders of the Eiffel Tower, keeps the visuals interesting. Better you buy a postcard."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,"If you like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing you'll like."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,"It works primarily because of the chemistry between Chan and Tucker, which is at its combustible best this time out."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,It's the same package with new wrapping.
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,"For a series devoted to giving audiences exactly what they want, it'd be pretty damn appropriate."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,50,"The first Rush Hour was a pretty good movie, the second one pretty lame. The threequel is somewhere in between: nothing special but with a high amiability quotient. The two stars know they click; it's no crime for them to extend and exploit that good vibe one more time."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,38,"Dull, uninspired, and redundant."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,38,"Chan still sounds silly talkin' jive, the action sequences are peppy if not exactly memorable, and the gags have been sitting out long enough to make penicillin."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,38,"If ""Casino Royale"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" represent the new breed of 21st century action, then Rush Hour 3 is Stone Age stuff. The movie aims for irreverent, but delivers irrelevant instead. Let's hope the Rush Hour series stalls here."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,38,"""Rush Hour"" was acceptable. It was to ""Rush Hour 2"" what McDonald's is to White Castle. ""Rush Hour 2"" is to Rush Hour 3 what White Castle is to cat food."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,30,"The junky, clunky, grimly unfunny follow-up to the marginally better “Rush Hour 2” and the significantly finer “Rush Hour,” isn’t the worst movie of the summer. But it’s an enervating bummer nonetheless, largely because it shows so little respect for its two likable stars and its audience."
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,25,Rush Hour 3 is DOA.
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,20,It just signals a series that's plainly out of gas.
Rush Hour 3,6.2,140125968,10,"The biggest loser in all of this is Chan, whose legacy over here won’t be his 20+ years as a martial arts pioneer, but rather his playing straight man to the likes of Tucker and Owen Wilson."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,91,"No, it doesn't exactly re-create the magic that made the original such an instant classic, but it's faster and more involving than ""Reloaded"" and it rounds off the premise and themes of the trilogy in a surprisingly satisfying way."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,80,"The trilogy ascends and soars with the two combatants and ends not with a whimper but with a blast of light. Thus the fabulous original film has found an honorable way to sign off. For those who didn't bother to join the early crowds, The Matrix Revolutions is a definite might see."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,75,"To the degree that I was able to put aside my questions, forget logic, disregard continuity problems and immerse myself in the moment, The Matrix Revolutions is a terrific action achievement. Andy and Larry Wachowski have concluded their trilogy with all barrels blazing."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,75,"Revolutions, the final installment in the trilogy, parcels things more neatly. You get 45 minutes of the Wachowskis' patented theosophical bong water, followed by an hour of the most muscular, hard-core special-effects rama-lama yet to hit the screen. Only then does Jesus show up."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,70,"Though theyre full of undeniably spectacular moments, great production values and unusual ambition, a simple thing has gotten lost in these sequels: theyre not much fun."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,70,"No less than the rankest demagogue, The Matrix Revolutions insists on the primacy of faith over knowledge. Once it locks and loads, however, the triumphant visuals short-circuit anything resembling abstract thought."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,67,"Its an impressive closing to the cycle, and, frankly, one that arrives not a moment too soon."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,63,"Represents a disappointing way for the science fiction trilogy to bow out. Overlong and underwhelming, The Matrix Revolutions reinforces the thinking that its a rare movie series in which the final chapter is the strongest."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,63,"On the plus side, there are these super-scary mechanical octopus-type things with a billion eyes and metal tentacles that fly in great awful swarms and look like the non-organic versions of the flying-brain-and-spinal-cord monsters that made the otherwise laughable '60s sci-fi flick ""Fiend Without aFace"" so cool."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,60,Everything about the sequel feels bloated.
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,60,"Ending with neither a bang nor a whimper, the finale falls somewhere in between. It's an improvement over its concurrently shot, babbling predecessor, but it ultimately fails to capture any of that jaw-dropping sense of exhilaration that made the original such a must-see event."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,60,"It neither works as a stand-alone film nor captures the thrilling sense of somber, pulpy mystery that made ""The Matrix"" so compelling. Nevertheless, It brings the saga to a satisfying close, and relies less on the clumps of pop-mystical cyber gobbledy-gook that gummed up the gears of ""Reloaded"" and more on the powerful emotional bonds that bind Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, Niobe, Link and Zee."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,60,"The result is visually slick, almost shockingly simpleminded, kinda redundant and only adequately satisfying. Alas, for their dramatic wrap-up the Wachowskis' storytelling now feels less intriguing than merely dutiful."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,60,"Shot at the same time as ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" this last installment is the shortest of the bunch at 129 minutes, but I still succumbed to special-effects hypnosis in the last hour."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,60,"The Year Of The Matrix will be remembered as an indulgence for fans, while the original movie will be affectionately held as a separate entity by a bigger crowd, much as the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy hasn't really been tainted by divisions over Episodes I and II."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,60,"Among its better tricks, Matrix Revolutions finally gets the love-story subplot of Neo and Trinity in the right proportion."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,58,"You can virtually see the mystique peeling away while beholding the turgid melodrama, patchy plotting, windy dialogue and, yes, spectacular combat effects of this grand finale."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"At the risk of understatement, The Matrix Revolutions sucks."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"Mostly feels as hackneyed as the first film felt fresh. It's a loud, puffed-up exercise in computer-generated heroics and battles that follows a pattern."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"Unless you're seriously into the post-""Matrix"" culture, which includes books, games, animation and interactive Web sites, or you believe the Wachowskis have a philosophy worth wading through, the two-part sequel adds nothing indispensable to the first story."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,How did something that started out so cool get so dorky?
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"Sets out to answer all sorts of cosmic questions, though the one most frequently asked is more mundane: Is it better than ""Reloaded""? The answer is a matter of degree."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"The Matrix Revolutions blends feather-brained, starry-eyed camp and rock-'em-sock-'em spectacle -- so it's at least more entertaining than the second Matrix film, which hung in the air like a noxious cloud."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"It's a testament to the personalities of the actors, as well as the foundation laid by the original film, that we retain an emotional connection to the main players in Revolutions."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"There are, to be sure, some impressive special effects here, and whoever Warner Bros. hires to make the new Superman movie should take notes."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"Now The Matrix Revolutions is here, and a verdict is justified. The death penalty seems a little strong, but can we lock this franchise up and forget where we put the key?"
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"Isn't a terrible movie, but it is a tremendous disappointment."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"Written and directed by the clever Wachowski brothers, this is a sequel that only a die-hard fan could love. But those fans will love it very, very much."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"Nearly wall-to-wall climax -- an unwieldy, two-plus-hours third act of a movie, guided by the principle (incubated by ""Reloaded"" and fully grown here) that too much is never too much."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"There is very little that is tantalizing or suspenseful. The feeling of revelation is gone, and many of the teasing implications of ""Reloaded"" have been abandoned."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,40,"Revolutions isn't as stupefying as ""Reloaded""--and, of course, our expectations have been drastically lowered. But it's an abysmal anticlimax all the same."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,40,"This final installment jettisons most of the Zen mumbo-jumbo from the first two movies in favor of lots of very loud explosions. Since I didnt take the mumbo-jumbo seriously to begin with, my letdown was minor, but aficionados may feel like theyve been played for suckers."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,40,"Once the dust clears, it's hard to think of a film saga that's wound down with such a profound anticlimax. It's a whimper in bang's clothing."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,40,"This (hopefully) final chapter's interminable first hour...showcases some of the clunkiest dialogue and wooden acting since the most recent ""Star Wars"" movies."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,38,This come-down of a series capper is so arch and pompous amid its clanks and collisions that you can only snicker at the verbal wind that obscures the din of marauding machinery.
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,38,"Without a philosophical payoff, without characters whose relationships resonate in our hearts, without explanations for situations that beg for explanations, what are we left with? To quote another great writer of battle scenes: ""a tale full of sound and fury, told by an idiot, signifying -- nothing."""
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,38,"The film is a soggy mess, essentially a loud, wild 100-minute battle movie bookended by an incomprehensible beginning and a laughable ending."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,30,"The Wachowski brothers have rendered their chronicles into banality, as if trying to imitate the qualitative tailspin of the ""Star Wars"" series."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,30,Dismal final installment.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,75,Bay's movie is also a confident mega-production that feels it doesn't need to lean on its visual frills if it has Smith and Lawrence -- it's a natural-born buddy flick.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,75,"Watching a Bruckheimer with natural comics like Smith and Lawrence makes it all go down easily. If you like this type of movie, that is."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,70,"The bigger-than-big, rambunctious spectacle is way too much of a questionably good thing."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,70,"It may be the most winning, smile-inducing Hollywood action flick of the summer."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,70,"However masterful, the first-rate stunt work, effects, action cinematography and cutting (by no less than three editors) lose impact through sheer repetition."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,67,"Though the picture has a generic quality, it also has an ingenious amount of anything-goes that's amusing and frequently exciting. You'll laugh out loud, you'll hide your eyes -- but you'll roll them. too. Nevertheless, it's a fun, if blood- and sun-soaked, ride."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,67,Bad Boys II proves that it's possible to pack a movie with so much popcorn that it leaves the audience overdosed.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,63,"The kind of movie that gives sequels a bad name, even though, strangely enough, it's better than the 1995 hit that spawned it."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,63,"Beyond turbocharged. It whooshes along at warp speed. And still, despite some awesomely choreographed stunts and the two stars' pedal-to-the-metal appeal, the movie seems endless."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,60,"But damn it if the film doesn't work as what it's supposed to be: a big, brainless blast o' boom at the box office."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,60,"In general, Bad Boys II is Bay unleashed. This is a good thing when it comes to action sequences--fans of excessive spectacle will definitely dig the car chases that involve flying cadavers. It's a bit less of a good thing between said moments of spectacle."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,50,"With a body built for action and a smile made for comedy, Smith eases through his scenes -- cool but never scary, a touch hip-hop and thoroughly audience-friendly. And unlike Lawrence, he can act. Smith's ability to put over a scene, combined with his matinee charm, goes a long way to making the film's violence palatable."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,50,Just too much of a mediocre thing. It didn't have to be that way.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,50,Might be considered three action sequences and four comedy routines in search of a story.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,50,Martin Lawrence's Marcus is the Costello to Smith's Abbott.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,50,"The best moments come when Mr. Smith and Mr. Lawrence are permitted to pause from their action-hero duties and run their funny, unpredictable mouths."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,50,"Just like ""Bad Boys,"" only louder, longer and the stars get paid more."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,40,The movies length forces our suspension of disbelief for at least an hour more than is comfortable and pushes mindlessness to a dangerous longevity.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,40,"Resembles a full-length promo for itself. The action, virtually nonstop, is a series of can-you-top-this? set pieces."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,40,"As overblown as it is overlong, Bad Boys II is an enervating case of more is less."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,40,"If you think you're tough enough, go ahead and sit through the endurance test that is Bad Boys 2, a brutal, 2 1/2-hour display of production overkill."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,38,"Smith and Lawrence enjoyed some amusing chemistry in the '95 original, but their molecules sure aren't jibing here. It's a full hour into this behemoth before there's anything resembling a belly laugh."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,38,"The apotheosis of adolescent junk. Every sequence spews or splats carnage-filled effects. It's over-the-top, but not pleasurably so -- it's calculatedly over-the-top. The only way to get off on it is to revel in its prodigal waste of materiel."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,38,Appallingly mean-spirited.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,38,Bad Boys II is the rare case in which escapism involves leaving the theater.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,30,"Another Jerry Bruckheimer-Michael Bay demonstration of spectacle -- noise, stunts, the aforementioned incoherent editing -- taking precedence over story and character... by far the most brutal American picture released this summer."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,30,The movie is so choppy in its nervous editing that a lot of the time we're simply watching senseless kinetic action.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,25,"It's basically the longest (a butt-numbing 21/2 hours), the most expensive (a reportedly obscene $150 million), most vulgar and by far the stupidest episode of ""Miami Vice"" ever."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,25,The vilest film of the season.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,25,"There's at least one ending too many, Union regularly vanishes for long stretches of the movie, and director Michael Bay's unmitigated pandering to viewers who whoop with glee whenever someone gets it between the eyes is genuinely distasteful."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,20,The only thing as bad as bad comedy is bad action. Bad Boys II has plenty of both.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,12,"Bad Boys II has everything. Everything loud, dumb, violent, sexist, racist, misogynistic and homophobic that producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay can think of puking up onscreen."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,0,"This putrid action flick crawls along for two and a half hours before expiring in a septic field of bad one-liners, halfhearted catchphrases, obliterated cars, vicious slow-motion bullet penetration, graphic corpse mutilations played for laughs, and shamefully hollow bonding scenes between its two dyspeptic megastars."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,88,"You need to see this one on the biggest screen possible, and let it wash over you as if you had stepped inside the most incredible video game experience ever created — one in which events in the manufactured universe can have lasting and serious real-world consequences."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,83,"It runs too long and drags a bunch in its final third, but make no mistake: This is Spielberg’s biggest crowdpleaser in years, a CGI ride that wields the technology with an eye for payoff."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,81,"The sheer dynamism and energy of the movie are compelling, even when the character drama isn’t."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,80,"Its plot is complexity itself, but its ""kids save the world"" soul is simple and earnest as opposed to earth shattering. With apologies to Bill and Ted, it's an excellent adventure, and let's leave it at that."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,80,The movie is crammed with excitement and good humor.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,80,"Spielberg has seemingly done the impossible: balancing sugar-rush nostalgia with an involving story to create a pure, uncynical, cinematic ride that recaptures the magic of his early films."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,80,"A rollicking adventure through worlds both bleak and fantastic, Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One makes big changes to the specifics and structure of Ernest Cline's best-selling novel but keeps the spirit and level-up thrills intact."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,76,"I don’t know how he does it, or for that matter why, but Spielberg turns Ready Player One into something that’s both nostalgic and new, something impersonal yet uniquely his. It is not one of his better movies; it’s probably not even in the top half. It’s way too long and packed with too much extra junk. It is still, somehow, a gas."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Although Ready Player One is nowhere near as memorable as “Jaws” or “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” it demonstrates that the director is fully capable of adapting to the times. What the film lacks in substance, it makes up for in style."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"My main beef is with Spielberg’s choice to leave out his own work, both as producer and director: “I didn’t corner the ’80s market,” he told Entertainment Weekly. But yeah, he kind of did."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"A loving ode to a few decades that Spielberg made his own, Ready Player One’s an entertaining nostalgia trip that wears its influences proudly but throws them at such dizzying force that sometimes you feel like you’re buried under Chuck E. Cheese tokens."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Never mind the director’s still-prodigious work ethic, the big-screen adaptation of Ernest Cline’s giddily overstuffed, ’80s-saturated best-seller is, in a way, a movie that couldn’t be more bespoke to Spielberg. After all, so many of that decade’s most indelible touchstones poured directly from his brain. It’s the perfect marriage of fabulist and fable."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"It’s good to see Spielberg, at 71, still finding new forms of cinematic language with which to express his humanism. It also should be said that though Ready Player One wears a cheerful face, there are none of the usual heartwarming, classic Spielberg moments. That’s because, second to “Munich,” this is his most pessimistic film."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Spielberg has invested massive creative capital into Ready Player One and the resulting production has all the ingredients viewers expect from potential blockbusters. Whether it achieves the level experienced by Spielberg’s biggest successes remains to be seen, but it is without a question one of the year’s most energetic, visually rewarding, and ultimately exhausting motion pictures."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,Spielberg's visual inventiveness is unflagging.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One, a rollicking virtual-world geekfest flooded by ’80s ephemera, doesn’t just want to wade back into the past. It wants to race into it at full throttle. For those who get their fix through pop nostalgia, “Ready Player One” is — for better or worse — an indulgent, dizzying overdose."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Spielberg’s control of pacing, rhythm, action dynamics and tonal juggling is so astute that the story of Wade never quite gets lost in all the fly-by jokes and references. Sheridan’s highly skillful, as is Cooke."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Ready Player One, based on the bestseller of the same name, is a pandering, crassly commercial victory of intellectual property law that’s also, in its best moments, a grand popcorn entertainment, made with skill and wit and even sincerity."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Dazzling in form and a chase film at its heart, Ready Player One is exhilarating, but it also can’t sit still. Fitting to the content perhaps, the movie still arguably suffers from troublesome A.D.D. with its hyper fast cutting and its tendency to wander narratively."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Everything in Ready Player One ties together into an action-packed, upbeat, hero’s journey that keeps the film moving along at a thrilling pace. While it’s not particularly emotional and I was disappointed by how many questions are left open by its shallow visits to the real world, it’s still a lot of fun."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,70,"Ambitious, sweet-spirited."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,70,"There’s not much wrong with the movie on its own terms. But there’s nothing great about it, either. It doesn’t have the breathless exuberance, the highs, of Spielberg’s best “escapist” work, maybe because everything is so filtered, so arm’s length."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,70,"Visually, the movie is amazing — jaw-droppingly so. This is as technologically impressive as anything Spielberg has done, if not more so. The story, on the other hand, based on the bestselling novel by Ernest Cline, doesn’t just allow for narrative shortcuts; it practically demands them."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,70,It’s an accomplished and intermittently hypnotic movie. Yet you may feel like you’re occupied more than you are invested.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,67,"Spielberg wants us to drop the techno-gadgets and join hands, but it’s the VR world that really juices him. He’s the ultimate fanboy making a movie about the need to move beyond being a fan."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,67,"And yet, for all those weaknesses, this is a Steven Spielberg film, of the kind only Steven Spielberg can make. Big, raucous, heartfelt, referential, and unabashed in celebrating the culture he has always loved."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,65,"Rather than dig into the mind-boggling, byzantine inner workings of the OASIS, Spielberg spends time with the flashier stuff. He is, even in this later, moodier phase of his career, still an entertainer first and foremost."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"It overuses ’80s nostalgia as shorthand for genuine emotional involvement, and it presents us with a rapturous digital wonderworld only to sternly lecture us that reality is the better value."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One is competent, occasionally rousing entertainment that nonetheless left me a little bummed."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"Ready Player One is at once familiar in its fabric and forward thinking in its technology, with a combination of gritty live action and glossy CGI. It’s an ambitious mix that can be thrilling while it lasts, and yet it fails to linger for long afterward, leaving you wondering what its point is beyond validating the insularity of ravenous fandom."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"If Ready Player One is tedious at times, it’s also oodles of fun at others."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"I didn’t dislike “Player One,” even if I rolled my eyes at the low-hanging fruit one-liners and cloying characters, the on-the-nose soundtrack tunes (Van Halen?), the cringe-worthy avatars from your favorite horror movies, all introduced to the giggles and applause of an audience sure it’s in on the joke. Because the movie was concocted to elicit just that reaction."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"It's a boldly attempted strike against the monolithic corporatization of fan service, and arguably one of the few films that defines dystopia as nothing less than a marketplace of trademarked, cross-promotional intellectual property. In other words, our here and now."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"I saw the film in IMAX, and a week later I’m still waiting for the safe return of my optic nerves, but it was the meagre emotional charge that shocked me most. Toward the end, as in many Spielberg movies, there are tears, but, for once, they feel unearned."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,Ready Player One is set in a dystopian future. But it seems to have no idea how dystopian it really is.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"It misses the point to ask, as some have recently, whether he’s still able to have fun at the age and status he has attained. Sure he is. He must have had great fun making this immense Tinker Toy of a movie, but there’s a fundamental mismatch between artist and material."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"It’s a film in which Spielberg’s traditional reverence for the wonder and idealism of youth has had to compromise with wised-up survivalist toughness of the new YA mode. But what extraordinary visuals this films conjures up, with images that appear and disappear like quicksilver memes."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"Ready Player One is entertaining enough, and it’s certainly well-made, but what truly stands out is the filmmaker’s prevailing-present sense of bemused disgust at the way his offspring are spending their time. He can’t go home again, and he knows it."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"Mr. Spielberg, a digital enthusiast and an old-school cineaste, goes further than most filmmakers in exploring the aesthetic possibilities of a form that is frequently dismissed and misunderstood."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"Spielberg asks audiences to fondly remember their childhood, and to fall back in love with characters, songs and stories long forgotten. At the same time, there is a didactic notion that reality is always better than a synthetic replication. You can’t comfortably have both."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"It’s a CGI-heavy fantasia that will pop your eyeballs, but giddy as it is, it never quite sells its characters or gets much purchase on your emotions."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"Once the initial thrill wears off, it’s a hollow kind of fun, which is almost certainly the point."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,Ready Player One isn’t slick enough a commentary worth getting riled up about or distracting enough to hide glaring structural issues underneath a barrage of “HEY I KNOW THEM!” cameos like dangling keys in front of a dog.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,58,"It’s a theme park ride but not the rollercoaster Spielberg hopes. More like It’s a Small Virtual World, careening through gamer nirvana, jerking viewers to and fro among everything Gen X retro."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,58,"In spite of how visually dazzling and legitimately entertaining it is, Ready Player One is at its heart, a celebration of the gormless rube. It is a paean to the schmuck. To celebrate it uncritically is to become one."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,"So much of Ready Player One is assembled from the detritus of our past that it is less a film and more an overstuffed cultural recycling bin. A shiny, expensive, well-cast and professionally assembled recycling bin, sure, but a trash heap all the same."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,"The scenes of millions of things happening at once are skillfully made, to be sure, but they’re still visually busy to the point of numbness instead of energization. The action has verve but no soul."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,"Ready Player One has no obligation to be a rigorous intellectual exercise, even if it amounts to a wasted opportunity to explore who else might steer tech, and society, toward greater equity. But it doesn’t have to be so facile, either. Maybe next time the screenwriters shouldn’t set the difficulty mode to “easy.”"
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,The emphasis here is on the splashy spectacle with those insider-knowledge elements jammed together in a frenetic hodgepodge.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,"This film, mostly shot in the UK, is technically suberb. But splitting the pleasures of virtual and reality, Ready Player One never fully satisfies on either front."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,"Because Spielberg seems as eager as Wade to get back to the digital fantasy world he’s created, a lot of the human element is elided or glossed over."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,45,"Overall, the movie left me feeling bombarded with images, bored by the lack of an interesting story, and irritated with my own cultural past."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,42,"The joy of Ready Player One does indeed come from its world-building and kaleidoscopic mashup of pop culture—what Spielberg would likely dub its “movie” elements.... At a certain point, though, Ready Player One wants to be appreciated as a film as well as a movie, no matter what Spielberg says. And that’s where it begins to falter."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,40,"Those who come away cheering for Ready Player One will likely have enjoyed the film’s many references, the story’s breakneck speed and playful visual design. Others may want to unplug from the paint-by-number characters and shallow plot."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,30,"With Steven Spielberg behind the camera, Ernest Cline’s book had potential to transcend its source material. It’s disheartening that the finished product is little more than the cinematic equivalent of a pop culture mashup tee, which takes cherished icons of film and coats them in garish CGI while clumsily smashing them against one another like a child playing with action figures."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,100,"Mr. Howard has made Ransom in the same clean, swift, logical style that sent his ""Apollo 13"" into orbit, resulting in a spellbinding crime tale that delivers surprises right down to the wire."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,90,"The 1996 kidnap drama Ransom traverses the parameters of public life in America, from the image public figures present to us to the image they never intended us to see. Neither one tells the whole truth. Luckily, Ransom isn't content with surfaces.."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,90,"Although the story is built around the automatically emotional situation of an imperiled kid, scripters Richard Price (who appears briefly as an uncomfortably handcuffed victim of Sinise in the early going) and Alexander Ignon and director Ron Howard largely steer clear of milking the easy melodrama."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,80,"Its major sin--a certain ineluctable improbability--is pretty much offset by the moments of winsome humanity Gibson finds for his freebooter; by the rich, nicely tuned portrayals of the other actors; and by director Ron Howard's smoothly professional mastery of yet another genre that is new to him."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,75,"The movie would have benefitted from a tight rewrite (it is too ambitious in including plot threads it doesn't have time to deal with), but Gibson's strong central performance speeds it along."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,75,"Ransom isn't a bad thriller, it's just not a great one. There's a little too much pointless running around, a subplot that leads nowhere, and a certain creeping predictability that argues for a shorter running length."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,75,"Slick thrills and the star's blue eyes are enough to make Ransom the fall's monster hit. Instead, Howard and Gibson stake out a Moclock side in all of us that won't be banished, not even by a happy ending. I'll be damned."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,75,"Ransom is every bit as taut and expertly directed, and it's another in the emergency genre, one in which Howard excels."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,75,"Until the disappointingly conventional ending, in which dad and the head baddie go it mano a mano on the streets, this dark drama -- based on a 1956 Glenn Ford picture of the same name -- negotiates its narrative twists and turns with professional aplomb, even daring to make the hero an arrogant schmuck."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,75,"There are more climaxes in here than in a Swedish blue movie. This is not to say you won't be thrilled, charged up and put through the ringer at times, but your intelligence will need to be shoved under your seat like warm, flat soda."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,70,"Though the film gleams with Howard's customary spit polish, there's no denying that the story is pitted with plot holes."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,70,"Ransom has some clever and exciting moments, but in scene after scene it teases you with gamesmanship only to pummel you with contrivance."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,67,"Since ""To pay or not to pay"" is banal, the plot takes the popular path of excess to a brain-boggling twist (to be specific would be to ruin what fun there is), then spirals off in a series of ever more unlikely gyrations, until a heretofore decent picture has gone completely south into fantasy-land."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,50,"Gary Sinise is chilling as the villain, and the screenplay by Richard Price and Alexander Ignon shows some interest in class hostility and other social issues, although this doesn't extend far enough to allow the women of the story a chance to shine in their male-dominated surroundings."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,50,"A persuasive thriller for most of its length, it stumbles in its attempt to become an upscale version of ""Death Wish"" and other vigilante dramas and ends up derailing with a soft thud."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,50,"Director Ron Howard makes too much of camera and editing tricks, as if momentarily confusing us about where a character is or which character's point of view the movie is taking will somehow deepen the narrative."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,50,"Beneath the handsome production values, the steady motor of Ron Howard's direction and the solid acting of Mel Gibson as a flashy airline tycoon whose son is abducted in Central Park, Ransom is pure poison: the kind of hang-'em-high rouser that feeds off our basest impulses and prods us into cheering the hero on as he commits grisly, retributive acts of violence."
Ransom,6.7,136492681,40,"A reprehensible movie from just about every perspective, Ransom tries to justify the behavior of its lead character as something grounded in principle, but make no mistake about it: This is the act of a man who can't bear the thought of losing, a man who will turn the tables on his enemy at the risk of a beloved's death."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,90,An expertly designed theme park ride of a movie that packs nonstop thrills.
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,70,"The plot is about as ridiculous as you'd expect, but for the most part its absurdities are tolerable."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,60,"Despite all the flash and filigree, this monster movie is curiously -- and conspicuously -- lacking in heart."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,58,"There are some clever and exciting sequences, but this $120 million epic of reconstituted Atomic Age trash lumbers more than it thrills."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,50,"Size really is about all that this tedious, underpopulated beanbag of an epic has going for it."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,50,Godzilla is so clumsily structured it feels as if it's two different movies stuck together with an absurd stomping finale glued onto the end.
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,50,This Godzilla is lacking both the awesome spirit of the original and the sublime silliness of the more recent Toho outings.
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,50,"It probably would have benefited from a 20- to 30-minute trim and, certainly, a smarter script, but the special effects truly are amazing."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,50,"The movie is of minimum interest; the story of the movie, however -- or, rather, of the way in which it has been engulfed by its own publicity -- is bound to fascinate connoisseurs of cultural meltdown."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,40,"The year's most eagerly anticipated green-eyed monster finally rears its ugly head, not with his trademark radioactive roar, but a deafening yawn."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,40,"Casting aside the forgettable ragbag of a cast, tiptoeing round the leaden script, and avoiding the story's many pot-holes (how come he only breathes fire twice?), Godzilla does provide plenty to look at. But that, for fear of sounding ungrateful, is all."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,38,"A big, ugly, ungainly device to give teenagers the impression they are seeing a movie."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,38,"The script isn't just ""dumbed down,"" it's lobotomized."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,30,"They do it up big, but their frame of reference -- mostly old sci-fi movies and TV shows -- is pint-sized."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,30,"For the single-digit age set, Godzilla is sure to be the greatest movie of all time."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,25,"When a movie is nothing but relentless action, there's little chance for dramatic tension to develop."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,25,"An overblown action monstrosity with no surprises, no exhilaration and no thrills."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,25,"The dialogue is dumb ('zilla has the best lines, ""arrrrrggh"" and ""maaroarrr""), New York is waterlogged, and Godzilla isn't on screen enough."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,20,The makers of Godzilla obviously devoted so much manpower and time and energy and money to the admittedly fabulous special effects that they apparently had no budget left over for actors.
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,10,"Overlong, neither funny nor scary movie about a big lizard."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,10,"While the special effects are impressive, countless films have already proven that if you sink enough money into a project, you can at least make it look good. Unfortunately, good looks are all Godzilla has going for it."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,10,"Size vanquishes both substance and subtlety in the overhyped, half-cocked and humorless resurrection of dear old ""Godzilla."""
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,0,Watching inept American actors and wishing they were badly dubbed into Japanese isn't any fun at all.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,80,"It’s not simply cashing in on the popularity of the TMNT cartoon, but is actually a thoughtful, emotional, and challenging movie about the loss and reconstruction of family. It’s got lots of hilarious one-liners and ninja action too, making it one of the most well-rounded comic book movies that’s not afraid to hold reverence to the source material while also having some fun with it."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,80,"A well-rounded, unpretentious, very funny, knockabout adventure - subtly blended so that it's fun for all the family."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,75,"High-spirited martial arts and comedy, with heavy doses of Star Wars and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,75,"Barron concentrates on keeping the action moving at a brisk clip, drawing on his music video experience to serve up an entertaining series of odd camera angles, gratuitous camera movements and complicated lighting schemes. The results are lively and funny enough to keep adults enthralled as well as kids."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,75,"The most interesting part of the film for a non-Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle fan is the production design - the sewers and the city streets above them. Roy Forge Smith is the designer, and seems inspired by a low-rent vision of Batman or maybe Metropolis."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,63,"The script is peppered with clever lines even the transformation (and expansion) of cartoon violence into the live arena is achieved without resorting to realism. To balance the fighting, Splinter waxes philosophically on loyalty, perseverance and anger."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,63,"while many reviewers were put off by Splinter's rheumy-eyed philosophizing and the Turtles' ninja antics, the movie's youthful target audience squealed with delight."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,63,"This film debut of the carapaced comic-book heroes features solid animatronic effects and a straightforward approach to superhero adventurism that should appeal to young Ninja Turtle fans, who should be pleased to see the terrapins brought so faithfully to the screen. However, a long-winded plot, broad characterizations and barely adequate fight scenes will prevent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from generating any breakthrough business."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,63,"Jim Henson's Creature Shop has created splendid animatronic characters (including a four-foot talking rat), though extra distinguishing marks between the turtles would be appreciated. Between the dubbed dialogue and the dark visuals, the cumulative effect is curiously dislocating."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,60,"The only thing this film has going for it is its improbable title and title song about four fighting turtles changed into upright, man-size creatures by exposure to radioactive wastes."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,60,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles never rises above its marketing-hook origins. It's a product, a commodity, a toy tie-in, a trailer for the comics, an advertisement for the cereal. It's a naked sell."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,60,"Parents can vaguely console themselves, however, that amid the kiddie pollution available on Saturday morning TV, the Turtles rank slightly better than the rest. At least they care about each other and fight crime for other than fortress-destroying, fascistically gratifying reasons. And maybe, just maybe, this will make them curious enough, one day, to check up on the real Michelangelo."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,50,"Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles was directed by Steve Barron, who has a number of music videos to his credit, and shows off the skills of Jim Henson's Creature Shop, without which there would have been no film at all."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,50,"Children will undoubtedly enjoy the ninja flick a lot more than their parents will, and it probably won't even give most kids nightmares. But couldn't a steady diet of this sort of thing help to desensitize very young children to real violence? If so, that's awful - not awesome - dudes."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,50,"When a kids’ flick has nothing to offer but cute special effects, it’s easy to think the filmmakers are patting themselves on the backs for their technical ingenuity. That’s not comic fantasy — that’s marketing."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,67,"For 100 minutes, I didn't think about anything else at all. And sometimes that small relief is the best thing a movie can give."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,67,"A pleasant, snappy, by-the-numbers buddy comedy."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,63,"Ride Along is a strong recommend when Hart is talking, but merely a mediocre attempt at a movie when he’s not."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,63,"Hart is much like Murphy: fast-talking, mischievous and irresistible. He's so confident and good-natured that we see how Angela fell for her pint-sized slacker."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,63,"Hart is clearly working overtime; there’s nothing effortless about his histrionic delivery, but it works."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,63,"Hart’s clowning here is that rare case where louder is, in fact, funnier."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,60,"The plot twists are easily guessed, and the film goes on for one predicament too long, but there are some good laughs."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,60,"This is time-worn, overly familiar material, indifferently directed by journeyman Tim Story, but Hart’s manic comic invention and textured persona elevates it somewhere beyond the level of pleasing mediocrity onto the slightly more distinguished realm of the agreeable-enough time waster."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,60,"Turns out to be something like a comic riff on ""Training Day."" Leaning more toward Hart's brand of slightly raunchy humor rather than Ice Cube's equally popular family-friendly fare, the PG-13 film exhibits broad appeal."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,58,"Many Jerry Lewis staples, including bratty children and imposing tough guys, are present and accounted for; at one point, Hart even childishly leaps into Ice Cube’s arms, Lewis-style."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,58,"Hart's exasperated dervish shtick has moments of real live-wire anarchy, including one priceless gag at a firing range. Will it be enough to make Hart a household name? Maybe. But both he and his fans deserve better."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,50,"Nothing in the movie makes sense, but I prefer to think that Ride Along is just a badly told joke, rather than an insult to its audience."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,50,"At its best, Ride Along is tolerable. At its worst, it borders on insulting."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,50,"It all mostly works, but you can’t help but wonder at times if it could have been a lot funnier if it had just a bit more edge."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,50,"Ride Along really isn't much of a movie, but the quality that makes it mostly watchable, and occasionally enjoyable, is the fact that it seems to know that it isn't much of a movie, and doesn't push against that fact too much."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,50,"Kevin Hart hits the vicinity of humor with a few of his drive-by wisecracks, but the movie itself has nothing under the hood."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,50,"Ride Along sabotages itself, although I suppose that doesn’t really matter — there are already plans in the works for Ride Along 2."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,50,A lazy and listless buddy-cop action-comedy that fades from memory as quickly as its generic title.
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,42,"He (Fishburne) rips into his dialogue like steak, savoring every word as if he were paid by the syllable. For a moment, we’re in a different movie, one where someone has decided to singlehandedly deconstruct a cliché. It’s a very short moment."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,40,"Director Tim Story (Fantastic Four) locates the right blend of humour and action in a couple of taut sequences, but Ride Along is saddled with an uninvolving plot, and largely content to coast on cop-movie clichés."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,40,"Here's a film that tries to strike a ""Beverly Hills Cop"" balance between crime drama and screwball comedy -- but that balance, it should be noted, isn't an easy one to strike."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,40,"Story and his four screenwriters don’t exactly strain themselves to find a new angle in this mismatched buddy comedy. Picture “Rush Hour,” and then imagine Hart as the annoying kid in “Are We There Yet?” You’ve basically just watched the entire movie in your head."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,40,Too bad that Ride Along never makes it to Ordinary; it sinks into sub-. This is a movie you keep watching only from lethargy.
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,40,"This rote buddy-cop action comedy is instantly forgettable. We’ve seen it all before, and worse than that, we’ve seen it done far better in films ranging from last year’s ""The Heat"" to Eighties classics such as ""Midnight Run"" and ""Lethal Weapon."""
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,40,"You can practically see Hart straining to break free of the script and let loose with a wild improvisational rant, and you never lose hope that he might. (Spoiler alert: He doesn’t.)"
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,38,"Ride Along is a film so casual in its conception and execution, it should be titled Drive Thru."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,38,"Time and again, Ride Along comes up with a clichéd setup — and then blows the payoff."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,38,"A little Kevin Hart goes a long way in Ride Along, a dull buddy picture engineered as a vehicle for the mini motor mouth and the perma-sneering Ice Cube."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,38,The film refuses to openly engage the isolationism and hardened cynicism that's often part and parcel of being a career police officer.
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,30,"The laughs here are lazy, and any sense of logic is definitely on the lam."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,30,Forget going soft — Ride Along proves Ice Cube's got bigger image problems than kiddie movies and Coors Light commercials.
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,25,"A collection of moldy gags that director Tim Story tries to polish. Not with these turds, pal."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,25,"Ride Along tries to be a comic version of “Training Day,” only there’s nothing in it as funny as Denzel razzing Ethan. There’s nothing much funny in it at all."
Ride Along,6.2,134938200,20,"Ride Along, set in Atlanta, gives shoddiness a bad name."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,100,"Either Live Free or Die Hard will go down as the summer's best action blockbuster, or it's going to be one exceptional summer."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,91,Easily the best in the series since the first one.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,90,It's simply old-school stunts and movie magic.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,90,"Though the movie's at least 20 minutes too long, it's deeply satisfying, full of old-school buddy banter and the kind of action sequences that make you burst out laughing at their sheer audacity."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,80,The sheer quantity of often outrageous stunts should help overcome franchise mustiness to entertain.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,80,"A slick and efficient piece of action entertainment, fast moving with energetic stunt work and nice thriller moves."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,80,"Does it herald a renaissance in the action genre? Not really, but it's a welcome throwback to good old-fashioned, '80s-style lunkhead violence, and no one takes a punch, kick, elbow, or bullet quite like John McClane."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,80,"Provided you don't think too long or hard about it (and why ever would you?), Live Free or Die Hard is infectious good fun, and a tremendous encouragement to the middle aged."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,80,"This fourth iteration of a series that first burst upon the world in 1988 turns out to be terrific entertainment, and startlingly shrewd in the bargain, a combination of minimalist performances -- interestingly minimalist -- and maximalist stunts that make you laugh, as you gape, at their thunderous extravagance."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"Early in LFODH, a villain taunts our hero, calling him ""a Timex in a digital world""; McClane, characteristically, takes the dig as a compliment. Two hours, countless butt-kickings and hairbreadth escapes later, we know why."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"The film's action doesn't disappoint; if anything, it ups the adrenaline ante considerably."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"Willis, who at 52 looks great in an intensely physical role and can still spit out wisecracks and insults with the best of them."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"Director Len Wiseman, confidently stepping up from the smallish budget ""Underworld"" films to mega-budget Hollywood mainstream."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"The action in this fast-paced, hysterically overproduced and surprisingly entertaining film is as realistic as a Road Runner cartoon."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"Surprisingly effective, rousing entertainment, which boasts plenty of old-school, at times jaw-dropping stunt work done the manly way."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,An enjoyable pop projection of post-9/11 anxiety.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,70,"At a time when the action genre has come to be dominated by sleek, matte surfaces and set-'em-and-forget-'em computerized effects, Live Free or Die Hard seeks to remind viewers of the simple, nostalgic pleasures of watching stuff get blown up and bad guys get smoked."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,70,"Bruce Willis is ready to earn our love again by performing the same lovably violent, meathead tricks as before."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,70,"Willis' John McClane, with that sly, sideways smile, is like an old acquaintance you don't mind running into. He may be older and balder, but he's none the worse for the wear. And he can still take a punch."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,67,"Superior in every way to 1995's ""Die Hard With a Vengeance,"" Live Free or Die Hard's goofy generation-gap gambit pays off decently and proves, again, that nattily dressed terrorists are no match for Willis, the once and future Patron Saint of Bang."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,Gets the action job done and you better believe that Bruce is still the man.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,"The key to enjoying the fourth installment in this testosterone-fueled franchise is accepting that it's a live-action cartoon that makes no effort to conform to the laws of gravity, plausibility or common sense."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,"In the moments at his disposal, Smith almost steals the flick. He's so wittily government-phobic that I found myself hoping for a climax that would blow Bruce Willis away and promote Kevin Smith to saviour-of-the-free-world. Now that might be a sequel worth rooting for."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,"Sorry, boys. After two decades, the first film still does more with one skyscraper than Live Free or Die Hard does with an entire country."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,"Directed in workmanlike style by Underworld: Evolution's Len Wiseman, has its share of wild stunts and spectacular carnage, but it feels pokey and predictable, too."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,"An unexpectedly retro throwback to '80s actioners and '90s hacker movies, totally preposterous in both its heroic near-death escapes and abstract tech-jargon explanations for how anyone with geeky inclinations can remotely override any computer system with a few easy keystrokes."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,I can safely say I've never seen anything as ridiculous as Live Free or Die Hard. I'm not saying my 10-year-old self didn't enjoy a lot of it.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,Take away Bruce Willis and this is straight-to-video material.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,60,Yippee-ki-yay! Willis still has the goods.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,58,A middling contender in this summer of gigantoid sequels.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,58,"Willis does everything short of donning a cape and reversing time by orbiting the Earth at light speed, and the air of cheerful ridiculousness recalls Luc Besson-produced action films like ""Transporter 2"" or ""District B13."""
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,50,"Diverting enough if you want to see plenty of fast-paced action sequences, some heart-stopping chase scenes and plenty of things blow up."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,50,"Maybe McClane, in '80s action parlance, is too old for this s---."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,50,"The physical stunts by Maggie Q as a lethal martial arts expert and Cyril Raffaelli as a Eurotrash sniper who rappels buildings are more thrilling than the over-the-top chase sequences, so contrived as to verge on self-parody."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,100,"This over-the-top, ultraviolent, hyperkinetic action thriller pretty much has it all."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,90,"It takes about an hour after it's over for the heart to slow, the brain to recalibrate, and the nonsensicalness of the thing to sink in."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,83,"Bekmambetov revs it up furiously and unleashes one bit of hyperactive, dazzling invention after another. The result is a throwaway wrapped up in the coolest packaging imaginable, which is acres better than the opposite."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,83,What's bleakly hilarious about the whole movie is that Bekmambetov directs the nonaction scenes just as hyperbolically.
Wanted,6.7,134508551,80,"Like it or not, Wanted pretty much slams you to the back of your chair from the outset and scarcely lets up for the duration."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,80,"Not as dark as its source material, Wanted works exceptionally on its own terms. McAvoy crashes the A-list, Jolie finally gets to be as big a star on screen as she has been in print, and Bekmambetov proves the most exciting action-oriented emigré since John Woo."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,80,The summer's zazziest action movie.
Wanted,6.7,134508551,80,"For all of its shortcomings, Wanted is a strangely enjoyable flick."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"If you're looking for memorable dialogue and gripping drama, then you better get in line for another flick. But if it's spellbinding special effects and high-wire acts you crave, Wanted should be at the top of your list for big budget thrill rides."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"Brutal, sexy, built to thrill and minus a scintilla of redeeming social value, the movie -- based on a series of comic books by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones -- explodes like summer fireworks."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"The way to enjoy this film is to put your logic on hold, along with any higher sensitivities that might be vulnerable and immerse yourself as if in a video game."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"Jolie steals the film from nominal star McAvoy in the wild gunfight and dynamically absurd chase that kick Wanted into high gear. Her wicked moves and seductive smirk brand her immediately as a true believer who really, really loves her work."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"His movies are thrilling and ridiculous in equal measure, and I often laughed with incredulous approval as he wreaked havoc."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"Best of all, there's a lot of Jolie, barrels blazing. The star's fearlessly sexy hauteur is unique in the biz today. And when she works it in Wanted, she kills, bullets optional."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"There are times when the film is flat-out silly (such as the spinning car assassination), but that's part of the movie's charm. At its worst, Wanted is never boring. At its best, it can be damn close to intoxicating. One word, written without apology, describes it best: fun."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,This is a blockbuster busting out of the block; this is a Hollywood staple served up on a European platter; this is summertime fare with a wintry verve.
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"Wanted is like a 12-armed heavy-metal drummer after a case of Red Bull, flailing and thundering through two hours of impossible action."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"In the end, Wanted may be most notable for cementing the connection between superhero movies and the cinematic craze they have temporarily supplanted, torture porn--both genres that, like ""Fight Club,"" address our ambiguous fascination with being powerless and invulnerable at the same time."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"With its pounding, bloody violence, foul-mouthed language and putrid worldview, Wanted isn't comic book-y on a par with ""Iron Man"" or ""The Incredible Hulk."" Rather it's an example of revenge of the nerds at its nastiest and most vulgar."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"Before Wanted reaches the end of its wild course, the violence that's been nothing but oppressive becomes genuinely if perversely impressive; the ritual carnage becomes balletic carnage (railroad cars included); the Walter Mitty-esque hero, Wesley, played by James McAvoy becomes a formidable enforcer of summary justice, and Mr. McAvoy, most memorably the young doctor in ""The Last King of Scotland,"" becomes a certified star."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"Wanted's hyperkinetic antics are sometimes weighed down by a surfeit of adolescent misanthropy. But the adrenaline-overdose strategy works for viewers as well as hit men. As long as Bekmambetov keeps the pedal to the metal, you don't notice the rotten scenery outside."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"Fast-moving and bloody, enjoyable even within its unapologetically generic limits. But McAvoy is its real secret weapon: With his X-ray blue eyes and lips that look bitten with anxiety, he has the miraculous ability to fool us into thinking there's really something at stake here."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"A compendium of bedside erotica. I don't know when I've seen a mainstream movie that so explicitly caters to the S&M niche. And the chemistry of the central couple, which seemed destined to bring the movie down, is instead the hottest thing in this effects-laden but ultimately empty film."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,67,Wanted is a queasily unapologetic power fantasy about becoming a better person through violence.
Wanted,6.7,134508551,63,The thrilling stunts and hyperkinetic action scenes are the undisputed stars of this surprisingly entertaining film.
Wanted,6.7,134508551,63,"Wanted is head-spinning stuff, and it's easy to get caught up in its masterfully manipulated mayhem. Visually, and viscerally, it's pretty awesome."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,63,"Slick, stylish and super-violent, but also oddly dull."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,63,"Preposterous, luridly entertaining."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,60,"As nonsense goes, this has a certain gusto and glee, and what dismayed me was that Bekmambetov felt the need to spice it with the addition of coarsely chopped violence."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,60,"There's barely a frame that doesn't look stretched, smashed or otherwise harassed. Imagine ""The Matrix"" on speed, and you're halfway there."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,50,"Wanted has one good plot twist in store (though it makes little sense), and its sense of humor about its own silliness keeps the fantasy afloat for a while. But as the body count rises, so does the portentous tone, and the relentlessness of Bekmambetov's overamped style becomes oppressive."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,50,"What are Jolie and Freeman and McAvoy doing here, besides acting cooler than Clive Owen in ""Shoot ’Em Up""? Cashing a check, that's what. Bekmametov may have talent, but the arrested-adolescent ""escapism"" of this picture emits a pretty bad odor."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,50,"Things happen in Wanted, but no one cares. You could call that nihilism, but even nihilism requires commitment of a kind and this, by contrast, is a movie built on indifference."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,50,"Either a go-for-broke action movie or a sick, sick movie for a sick, sick public."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,50,"The film hardly aims to be serious entertainment, and, to its credit, it's never uninteresting visually."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,42,"Violence in the movies, no matter how many CGI effects are utilized, can't help but be far more luridly realistic. And, in the case of Wanted, to what end?"
Wanted,6.7,134508551,30,"Big, cruel, stupid actioner."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,20,"With every bit of sliced flesh and every punctured skull I found myself wondering who exactly this movie is for. Its unflinching violence has earned it an R rating, meaning its desired demographic – teenage boys – is out of contention. That raises the question: Are there really adults who want to sit through this kind of mindless, bullying mayhem?"
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,Manages to capture the pure heart and spirit of this comic book Americana.
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,"Boasts a smart screenplay by Robert Benton and David and Leslie Newman, striking cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth (especially in the Smallville sequence), bright comic turns by Margot Kidder and Gene Hackman, and of course, that winning performance by Christopher Reeve in the title role. Believe a man can fly? You bet!"
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,"Superman is a pure delight, a wondrous combination of all the old-fashioned things we never really get tired of: adventure and romance, heroes and villains, earthshaking special effects, and -- you know what else? Wit."
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,"Estimates of the movie's costs range between $35-and $70-million; whatever the price, it was not too much to pay. As gods go, Superman is one of the godliest; his movie is one of the best."
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,"Magnify James Bond's extraordinary physical powers while curbing his sex drive and you have the essence of Superman, a wonderful, chuckling, preposterously exciting fantasy."
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,"A movie that is pure escape and good, clean, unadulterated fun."
Superman,7.4,134218018,88,"There's no doubt that it's a flawed movie, but it's one of the most wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made."
Superman,7.4,134218018,88,"Effective both as Superman and as the bumbling Clark Kent, Christopher Reeve still seems ideal for the part, if for no other reason than his ability to summon up a convincing sense of intensity when charged with saving the world."
Superman,7.4,134218018,83,"Despite a lull here and a lapse there, this superproduction turns out to be prodigiously inventive and enjoyable, doubly blessed by sophisticated illusionists behind the cameras and a brilliant new stellar personality in front of the cameras -- Christopher Reeve."
Superman,7.4,134218018,80,"it's the simple, earth-bound quality of the film that makes this comic-book fantasy soar."
Superman,7.4,134218018,80,"Superman is a bastion of blockbuster innocence, a movie that’s a studio product, certainly, but also something that could have grown from one of Smallville’s sun-kissed cornfields."
Superman,7.4,134218018,80,"The film is best when it takes itself seriously, worst when it takes the easy way out into giggly camp--as it does, finally and fatally, when Lex Luthor enters the action; Gene Hackman plays the arch-villain like a hairdresser left over from a TV skit."
Superman,7.4,134218018,75,"Superman is good, clean, simple-minded fun, though it's a movie whose limited appeal is built in."
Superman,7.4,134218018,70,"A highly entertaining, though undemanding mixture, of sci-fi, romance and comedy, which could hardly have come off at all at any lower artistic level, nor without such a happy choice for the central part as Christopher Reeve."
Superman,7.4,134218018,70,The film allows naiveté and knowingness to coexist. Only when it goes all out for cold Batmanesque villainy in the second half does it narrow its focus and lose its way.
Superman,7.4,134218018,60,"The film burdens itself with too many story lines and an overlong (though beautifully photographed) prologue, but things really get moving when Reeve takes the screen."
Superman,7.4,134218018,60,"Superman doesn’t have enough conviction or courage to be solidly square and dumb; it keeps pushing smarmy big emotions at us—but half-heartedly. It has a sour, scared undertone."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,88,"A first-rate, slam-bang action thriller with a lot of style and no little humor."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,88,It's a popcorn-movie deluxe.
The Rock,7.4,134069511,78,"The Guy Movie to end all Guy Movies, a ridiculously overblown summer testosterone blowout right down to the Wagnerian strains of the soundtrack and its stunningly high body count. It's also a hell of a lot of fun."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,75,"The borrowings from other movies, going all the way back to the car chase in 1968's Bullitt, are heavy. But Bay has three leads to lend weight and dimension to characters who are hardly original and flatly written."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,75,"Although not as expertly-crafted as ""Die Hard"" or ""Speed,"" The Rock is exhausting in its own right -- and that's just one of several convincing reasons to see this film."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,75,"A raucous, in-your-face, commando-style action thriller that makes provocative use of Alcatraz as a lunatic's lair and San Francisco as a sitting duck."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,75,"Bay has two great assets in Connery and Cage. The special effects give The Rock a James Bondian feel so Connery's wry, world-weary devil-may-careishness looks right at home here."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,70,"Slick, brutal and almost human, this is the team-spirit action movie Mission: Impossible should have been."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,70,"High-octane nonsense but gives both the actors and the audience all that's needed to make this diverting--car chases, wisecracks, narrow escapes, explosions."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,70,"Seldom is it clearer that a film is nothing more than high-gloss jokey escapism, or that when visual cliches are this relentless they become weirdly fascinating in their own right."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,70,"This is a pure popcorn picture that benefits heavily from its trio of highly skilled, charismatic leading thesps, an unusual setting that provides plenty of visual stimulation, and a confrontational standoff that actually stems from a legitimately provocative premise."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,67,Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage inject tasty bits of personality into their roles.
The Rock,7.4,134069511,63,"Connery and Cage are a compelling team and redeem the film from ruin despite the mechanical plot, an excessive body count and a miraculous recovery (you'll know it when you see it)."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,63,[Cage] cracks wise throughout the third act and is almost entertaining enough to make this absurdly energetic movie recommendable.
The Rock,7.4,134069511,50,"Cage proves his versatility as the reluctant hero (designed by way of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan character), bringing his comic timing and droll face into perfect pitch. His first scene with Connery is giddy fun. He steals the entire picture."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,50,"Slick and forceful, largely unconcerned with character, eager for any opportunity to pump up the volume both literally and metaphorically, The Rock is the kind of efficient entertainment that is hard to take pleasure in."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,50,"The presence of Connery is pure balm, purring those Celtic tones like smoky single-malt Scotch."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,50,The Rock is just typical big American dumb fun.
The Rock,7.4,134069511,50,"If it's not the most awful thing I've ever seen, it's close enough to make me wince."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,40,"A violence-intoxicated, far-fetched, morally corrupt drama."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,40,"It's an action junkie's angry fix -- 130 minutes of sound and fury, signifying nothing but big bucks and boundless contempt for viewer intelligence."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,40,"If, at odd moments, The Rock is better than tolerable, it is usually because of its stars."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,30,"Can a mild-mannered toxicologist and an eccentric Alcatraz veteran stop him before it's too late? Learning the answer means sitting through more than two hours of violence, vulgarity, and all-around excess, served up with high-tech trimmings by director Michael Bay."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,83,"Yes, it's fundamentally business as usual, but it's the best kind of business as usual, and it finds everyone working in top form. Abrams imports and enlarges ""Alias'"" smooth, stylish, yet remarkably visceral approach to action, and the actors pack a satisfying amount of drama into the moments between action scenes."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,83,"A gratifyingly clever, booby-trapped thriller that has enough fun and imagination and dash to more than justify its existence."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,83,It's an expertly engineered popcorn movie - hold the butter substitute - but it also tries (and fails) to be a love story for the ages.
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,80,"It's all poppycock, of course, but it's done with such vim and vigor and both narrative and visual flair that you care not a jot. Summer has arrived."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,78,"Bury the nostalgia. Like the rap twist Kayne West puts into the film's classic theme, this movie is best when it stirs it up."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,Against sizable odds -- a sense that the franchise is played out and its star over-exposed -- Mission: Impossible III delivers.
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"The supporting cast, including Ving Rhames, Laurence Fishburne and gorgeous Maggie Q, is underused, but the movie delivers the goods."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"In Mission: Impossible III, we find out whether it's still possible to look at Tom Cruise and not see a weirdo. The answer is yes, but a complicated yes, because it takes time."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"The end result is the very definition of a summer movie: breezy, undemanding and a carefully balanced blend of the familiar and the not-quite-what-you-expected."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"It's overwrought and overplotted, but it's plenty of fun."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"Big and fast and silly, but it's never dumb, and it's certainly never boring, either. The summer movie onslaught has begun on a high note."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"Unlike the previous two films in this series, Abrams is more concerned with his hero's heart than with his hardware. The result is a pulse-racing thriller that restores the human factor to the franchise, and to its producer-star."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"Though Abrams doesn't possess a fraction of the visual pizzazz of the two previous MI directors, Brian De Palma or John Woo, his incarnation is, from a narrative perspective, better made."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"In his feature debut, ""Lost"" creator J.J. Abrams, who got the job on the basis of ""Alias,"" takes the driver's seat with both feet on the accelerator."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"For all its far-fetched formulations, this new entry maintains more of a dramatic throughline and has the bonus of a villain played with unsparing meanness by Philip Seymour Hoffman."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"Cruise is probably the most graceful physical performer to occupy the screen since Burt Lancaster, and in this sort of action role, he's just about peerless...He may not be a great actor, but to find a greater movie star would be a nigh impossible mission."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,Hoffman is so proficient in this role that he just about overmatches Cruise and makes the wait until he speaks again in the second half of the film hard to endure with any patience.
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"Abrams keeps the action clicking along in 5/8 time, and Cruise is at his scowling/smiling best as he jumps, shoots and leaves. (See Tom run! Run, Tom, run!) Best is Philip Seymour Hoffman as the baddie; the film's best sequence features him playing Cruise playing him at a swank party in Vatican City."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"In the world of bloated movie-star vehicles, it's not unusual to see an ego trip of these dimensions. What’s rare is when one hits its marks so smoothly."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"M:i:III accomplishes its mission: to run smart variations on dumb tropes. After all, summer movies are not for students but for thrill consumers. Devour and enjoy."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"A film that climaxes in Shanghai shouldn't go down like a meal in Shanghai. But an hour after you see M:i:III, you may be hungry for a real movie."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"Shallow to its core and as propulsive as a runaway locomotive, it's the most blatantly summer movie-ish of the Mission Impossibles. And also, surprisingly, the most viscerally entertaining."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"Mission: Impossible III hasn't the kinks or the oddball Continental chic of the first ""Mission: Impossible,"" but it's less pretentious and obsessively pretty than the second movie."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,67,"Though dated and unsophisticated compared to the much cooler Bourne spy thrillers, M:i:III will probably hit the sweet spot at the box-office - and give Cruise a whole new reason to start jumping on couches."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"One of Cruise's most deeply cherished ambitions is to be a great actor, and this movie goes to great lengths to let him do that--sort of. You'll understand what I mean during the sequence in which there is more than one Philip Seymour Hoffman on the screen."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"Maybe it's foolish to be disappointed by a pure popcorn movie, but as I walked out of this film, I felt it had failed in its mission of pure entertainment."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"The real objective of all the ""M:I"" movies is to provide a clothesline for sensational action scenes. Nothing else matters, and explanatory dialogue would only slow things down. This formula worked satisfactorily in ""M:I,"" directed by Brian De Palma, and ""M:I II,"" directed by John Woo, and I suppose it works up to a point in M:I III, directed by J.J. Abrams, if what you want is endless, nonstop high-tech action."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"Only theoretically, though, is this exciting. Mostly, it all feels like a lateral move that keeps alive a franchise without breaking new ground."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"An inspired middle-hour pumped by some solid action gives you an idea how good the franchise could be, but we now live in a post-Bourne, recalibrated-Bond universe, where Ethan Hunt looks a bit lost."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"The movie raises your pulse, it has visual wow. But I suspect that audiences will emerge into the light feeling more battered than entertained."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"Producer-star Tom Cruise handed this one to alumni from the TV spy drama ""Alias,""  and the result is nearly as good as the series' best, Woo's Mission: Impossible 2."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,60,"M:i:III, like many blockbusters, would be nothing without its star."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,60,"While all the ""Mission"" plots are convoluted and slightly preposterous -- the keyword in the title is ""Impossible"" -- the latest is just this side of insultingly stupid. The longer you think about it, the less sense it all makes."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,60,"Absent the real sense of creepiness and highly honed film craft of De Palma, or the strong visual and emotional sensibility of Woo, M: I III feels like one of the more forgettable James Bond films -- saddled, moreover, with a star who's sliding into self-parody."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,60,"Clearly designed to be an action thriller with emotional underpinnings. But you can't get blood from a stone, no matter how hard you squeeze. And so Cruise, a huge box-office star, is the single bright, blinking emblem of the failure of Mission: Impossible III."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,60,"Mr. Hoffman enlivens Mission: Impossible III, which otherwise droops, done in both by the maudlin romance and by Mr. Abrams's inability to adapt his small-screen talent -- evident in his capacity as the television auteur behind ""Alias"" and ""Lost"" -- to a larger canvas."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,58,"Watching this movie is like sitting on your couch for two hours to catch a little network prime time: you may be mildly entertained, but damned if you’ll remember any of it five minutes later. On the plus side, you probably won’t care."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,58,"Aside from a single jazzy image of Hunt taking a nosedive off a Shanghai skyscraper, Abrams' movie is too oppressive, too enamored of its brutality to deliver anything like real thrills; its deeply unpleasant tone nearly makes you long even for Woo's cartoon absurdities."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,88,"A refreshing summer cocktail of action-movie staples, The Wolverine combines the bracingly adult flavor of everyone’s favorite mutant antihero — tortured, boozy X-Man Logan, a.k.a. Wolverine — with the fizzy effervescence of several mixers from the cabinet of Japanese genre cinema: noirish yakuza crime drama, samurai derring-do and ninja acrobatics."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,83,The movie's a solid fish-out-of-water thriller that just happens to be populated by a few folks with adamantium skeletons or poison saliva on their résumés.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,83,"If comic book movies are the last place you look for a soulful, serious performance, The Wolverine should be your first."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,80,"Taken on its own terms The Wolverine is the cleanest, least pretentious and most satisfying superhero movie of the summer."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,80,"The Wolverine boasts one of the best pulp-inspired scripts yet. It’s still full of corny dialogue...but there’s a genuine elegance to the way it establishes Logan’s tortured condition and slowly brings the character around to recovering his heroic potential, methodically setting up and paying off ideas as it unfolds."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"As a consolidated character piece threaded with a popcorn-munching action picture, The Wolverine is solid."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"The post-conversion 3D is more distracting than anything else, but the rest of this surprisingly fun entertainment is as sharp as the hero’s claws."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"Mangold front-loads the action, but near the end there’s a first-rate fight atop a bullet train between Wolverine/Logan and some especially pesky ninjas. It puts the train fights in the recent “The Lone Ranger” to shame."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"It has such a strong aesthetic about it, it's almost as if The Wolverine functions as its own stand-alone film, rather than as a piece of the ""X-Men"" mythology."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"Whether or not this flies in the unforgiving fan world remains to be seen. But for those less intemperately invested, The Wolverine will come as a welcome and bracing surprise: An almost human-scaled superhero movie about a guy who goes to die in Japan and ends up beating his way back to life."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"The Wolverine is one of the better comic-book movies of 2013, thanks in large part to an electric performance by Hugh Jackman."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"The Wolverine shows that, while originality would be nice, a little novelty and enthusiasm in the presentation of the familiar can be quite enough."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"Apart from Khodchenkova, who displays the acting acumen of a runway model and gives new meaning to the term Russian mole (she's the villainous vixen of the tale, suited up in high heels and slinky, scaly couture), the cast of The Wolverine is uniformly good."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,Finally - a superhero movie that doesn't feel like every other superhero movie.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"It's simply a more focused scenario than usual, full of violence done up with a little more coherence and visceral impact than usual."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,Jackman spends enough time compellingly playing stranger in a strange land that you’ll put up with a few unwanted doses of the old familiar.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"Now here’s a comic-book movie. In a summer that’s delivered one overstuffed Phase Two sequel and a bloated reboot designed to establish a whole new universe of interconnected franchises, The Wolverine has a self-contained efficiency that’s hard to resist."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,70,"As much as director James Mangold’s cinematic interpretation had going for it prior to pre-production, it’s a pity it only seldom succeeds—largely due to the decisions made way back before Darren Aronofsky was attached to helm."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,70,"A modest superhero picture may sound like a contradiction in terms, but really it is a welcome respite."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,70,Let all Marvel franchises have as long a life as Logan. But could Singer let Jackman sing a few numbers as the knife-fingered mutant? They could call it Les Scissorables.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,67,You have to hand it to Marvel for managing to leave audiences breathless in anticipation of a sequel after making them sit through two-plus hours of merely satisfactory storytelling.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,63,"An intermittently exciting action film anchored by a strong performance by Jackman, who embodies Wolverine like no one else could."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,63,I liked that The Wolverine (which saves a nifty twist for a surprise scene in the middle of the end credits) turns down the volume on the usual din of colliding mutant superpowers.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,63,"This pissed-off man of Adamantium claws is stalking new ground (Japan), and his fight with yakuza on top of Tokyo's speeding bullet train is a wowser."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,63,"This may be the year's best superhero movie because, for a sufficient amount of time, it doesn't feel like a superhero movie at all."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,63,"This Wolverine gets our hopes up, and falls short."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,60,"Unsurprisingly, Jackman is as perfect for Wolverine as he was when he first played the character 13 years ago. Convincing whether going berserk on a troublesome ninja or showing Logan's inner turmoil, he's a commanding presence throughout and, as you might expect, is the film's engine."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,60,It exists in fits and starts: a Blade Runner–esque moment of rainy contemplation on a hotel balcony; some weird sexual tension with a lizard girl (statuesque Svetlana Khodchenkova) who steals away Wolverine’s healing powers.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,60,"The Wolverine is an erratic affair, more lumbering than compelling, an ambitious film with its share of effective moments that stubbornly refuses to catch fire."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,60,The lack of plot coherence is a lingering irritant in a film that otherwise seems to be trying to improve on its cinematic-series forebears.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,60,The filmmakers work at creating a new take on an old protagonist and then don’t really have much new to do with him once they’ve achieved that. It’s a good effort. Just not an entirely successful one.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,60,"Until a third act that collapses in a harebrained heap, the director largely succeeds in keeping the more cartoonish aspects at bay, roughing up the surface with organically staged fight scenes and, crucially, raising the stakes by stripping his hitherto indestructible hero of his self-healing powers."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,60,An improvement on the last outing for Jackman’s not-so-merry mutant. If only it trusted enough in its unique setting to forgo a descent into aggressively awful formula.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,60,"It’s a step up from the garbled silliness of Wolverine’s first solo outing. Unlike Origins, the storytelling is more sharply focused here, ignited by flashes of stylised superheroism."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,50,"Slapped with the generic title The Wolverine, the fifth feature-length appearance of Hugh Jackman’s X-Man John Logan is basically ""The Bad News Wolverine Goes to Japan"" and is not especially world-shaking."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,50,"I'd like to credit Mangold, along with writers Christopher McQuarrie, Mark Bomback and Scott Frank for their good intentions; the smaller scope and lighter tone of their film is a tonic after bloated doom and gloom of ""Man of Steel."""
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,50,The mediocre mushy stuff isn’t alleviated by enough action.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,50,"The Wolverine—despite being an improvement on Gavin Hood’s muddled 2009 X-Men Origins: Wolverine—isn’t worthy of Jackman’s gifts. It’s a reasonably engaging summer diversion, a semi-rousing adventure that doesn’t make you feel robbed of two hours of your life."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,50,"This is Jackman’s show entirely, and he’s as forceful and charismatic as ever as the walking, talking hurt that is Wolverine. If only he had something more interesting to do here."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,42,"It’s rare that a movie stops making sense before anyone speaks a line of intelligible dialogue, but The Wolverine is a rare movie."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,42,"The Wolverine wants to have it both ways: a dark character story and an action-packed superhero film. But it never reconciles the two notes, and thus becomes more and more atonal as it wobbles towards its symphonically jarring ending."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,40,"Good thing the Aussie star has the role down to a science, since the rest of  The Wolverine is a howler."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,40,"This turgid return papers over the previous film’s narrative, but creates little in the way of a fresh character arc."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,40,"The flat hammerblows of The Wolverine bear little relation to the zing and pop of Matthew Vaughn's colourful treatment. Inconsistency is inevitable in a world that's constantly being dug up and done over, but it leaves us no time to fall in love with anything being flung at us."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,40,"The previous X-Men film, First Class, was secure enough in its own skin to embrace its comic side. Mangold’s picture affects a pubescent snarl instead: that’s the difference between comic and daft."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,31,"The Wolverine reveals itself to be a film in desperate need of a point, in dire need of consequences and in a wandering search of any semblance of emotional weight."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,88,"A movie likely to rally huge audiences who want to take another roller coaster ride. And though it may disappoint a few of them, it's also a film that gives you something to think and feel sad about. It smashes you -- gently."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,88,"A heady stew of psychological disorders and classic tragedies, borrowing from Shakespeare, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and the Greeks."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,88,"Hulk represents the most involving superhero motion picture since ""Superman"" soared skywards in 1978. By taking its time to develop characters and situations, Hulk does what so many action/adventure movies fail to do -- allow us to really feel for the protagonists."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,80,"The result is perhaps the most elegantly shot, and certainly the most disturbing, of the recent fantasy films."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,80,"Where so many comic-book movies feel as disposable as Kleenex, the passionate, uncynical Hulk stamps itself into your memory. Lees movies are built to last."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,80,"Hits on all cylinders -- a smart blend of acting, direction, editing, design, costumes and effects."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,78,"No one has ever succeeded with anything approximating the sheer energetic brilliance of what Lee has managed here. For all intents and purposes, this is a comic-book movie in the very truest and most vibrant sense of the phrase."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,75,"The Hulk has a split personality: Two-thirds come from director Ang Lee, one-third from '60s comic book creator Stan Lee."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,75,Ang Lee has boldly taken the broad outlines of a comic book story and transformed them to his own purposes; this is a comic book movie for people who wouldn't be caught dead at a comic book movie.
Hulk,5.6,132177234,75,Lees use of split-screens and dynamic transitions makes the process of actively interpreting his monstrous vision a fresh and unrivaled experience.
Hulk,5.6,132177234,75,"Lee's technique is impeccable, but he's chasing more inner demons than one creature feature can handle. No wonder the audience cheers when TV Hulk Lou Ferrigno shows up for a cameo. It's a reminder of a time when it was easier being green and a Hulk could just get pissed off and bust shit up."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,75,"Always energetic and sometimes cockamamie enough to be genuinely fun, Hulk is the blockbuster to beat this season."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,70,"The real star is the splendid computer-generated Hulk, though his King Kong-like story is compromised by the need to keep him around for the inevitable sequel."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,70,This impeccably crafted piece of megabuck fantasy storytelling aims to pull off the tricky feat of significantly reworking the superhero format while still providing the expected tentpole-type entertainment thrills for the international masses.
Hulk,5.6,132177234,70,"The Hulk is a beautiful movie, but it's unlikely to win points as a monster flick -- it's too elegant, too whimsical."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,70,"Takes the form of a wounded behemoth, battling to negotiate a compromise between a strong artistic vision and franchise expectations. It doesn't fully succeed on either count, but its integrity and substance stand out like an oasis in a field of cotton candy."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,67,"Director Ang Lee displays enormous verve and flair. He creates ingenious transitions between scenes, deploying split-screens in a clever variation on comic book panels and, as ever, drawing coolly impassioned performances from the cast."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,63,"Whereas the psychology is surreal and wonderfully fluid, the action is too real and surprisingly listless, displaying little of the kinetic zip, or the sheer lyricism, that Lee brought with such memorable effect to ""Crouching Tiger."""
Hulk,5.6,132177234,63,"I wanted more. I expected more. The filmmakers said it was going to be smart - really smart - like all of Lee's movies. Instead, it's big, dumb and fun."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,60,"However nifty, Lee's Cubist gambit fails to capture the graphic tension that makes great comic-book art jump off the page and great pop movies jump off the screen with pow, zap and wow!"
Hulk,5.6,132177234,60,"In the end, we don't know what we're watching, an art-house superhero film or a computer-generated ""King Kong."" By trying to please both sensibilities, the filmmakers have pleased neither."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,60,"Some Marvel fans and die-hard devotees of Lou Ferrigno, the bodybuilder who played The Hulk on television (and who does a brief walk-on here), may find Ang Lee's whole enterprise grandiose and, given its not-always-successful attempt to fuse brains and brawn, a little bit silly."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,60,"Folks read comics for enjoyment, not to admire how well the pictures are drawn, and the same axiom can be directed here with audiences likely to admire the work thats gone into this film -- rather than joyously enjoying the film itself."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,60,"As this all plays out -- and basically segues into ""King Kong"" -- the movie wins its biggest gamble: its entirely computer-generated monster works."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,58,"The main problem with The Hulk, really, is that there isn't enough Hulk in it."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,50,"More thoughtful and pleasing to the eye than any blockbuster in recent memory, but its epic length comes without an epic reward. It's a slow ride to the same old place, nonstop action, accelerating in scale, culminating in the smirking promise of a sequel."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,50,"Nolte's exploding patriarch jacks up the story's antisocial wish fulfillment into a Nietzschean-anarchist's wet dream, but one can only vainly hope that the preordained sequel will head in that dastardly direction."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,50,The entirely computer-generated Hulk is a surprisingly expressive creation  it certainly gives a better performance than Connelly  but the action is late in coming and feels like a long set-up for the inevitable sequel.
Hulk,5.6,132177234,50,"There's a fine line between darkness and glumness, one that ""Spider-Man"" bounced off buildings to avoid. The Hulk lumbers across it."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,50,"To answer your first question: like a cross between Shrek, the Frankenstein monster, and a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,50,"Unlike your average comic-book blockbuster, The Hulk isn't a bad cartoon. It's a bad modern Greek tragedy. It's a swing at the moon that looks (and smells) like green cheese."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,50,"A comic-book superhero has seldom squandered so much screen time being conflicted about his heritage and destiny -- and I don't mean conflicted in a sexy, Wolverine-y, ''X-Men'' way, either; a big-budget comic-book adaptation has rarely felt so humorless and intellectually defensive about its own pulpy roots."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,42,"Lee must have thought he could work a similar magic on this clunking, clanking machine. But despite a few witty wipes and split-screen tricks, he fails. Hulk is no better than hulking."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,40,"This messy, disappointing, self-important and utterly humorless version of the Marvel comic book character may be the toughest flick with a green protagonist to sit through since ""The Grinch."""
Hulk,5.6,132177234,40,"Belabored, ostentatious, overlong behemoth."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,38,"The Hulk goes on for two hours and 20 minutes and there's not a stirring or exciting moment in it...At last, a comic-book movie that National Public Radio listeners can be proud to take their kids to see."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,30,"The movie is bulky and inarticulate, leaving behind a trail of wreckage and incoherence."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,30,In future Lee can best serve his versatility by never doing anything like this again.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,"This is the kind of pure entertainment that, in its fullness and generosity, feels almost classic."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,"May show both director and star working at their professional peaks, but I don't think it's as good as that underappreciated masterwork ""A.I."" It's not as resonant and daring, not as full of magic and marvel. Spielberg stretches himself technically here but not emotionally."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,A heart-pounding experience that makes you think and contains a gallery of characters that will haunt your nightmares for years to come.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,"It affirms that, even in the 2000s, movies do not have to be brain-dead to be exciting. When the season is over, Minority Report will more than likely stand out as the best picture to grace multiplex screens during the Summer of 2002."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,"This film is such a virtuoso high-wire act, daring so much, achieving it with such grace and skill. Minority Report reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,"Stripped of all bravado, Cruise delivers a raw and probably detractor-proof performance. Spielberg does what he did right in creating a novel milieu for ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence,"" but this time the writing is fresher and anything but unwieldy."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,91,"A happy surprise: a timely antidote to the comic-book mindlessness of ""Spider-Man"" and repetitive space fantasy of ""Star Wars,"" and an encouraging bid from the top of the A-list to once again reach very high and spit in the face of the gutless formula filmmaking that rules Hollywood."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,Few directors are capable of marrying ideas and entertainmentone is often sacrificed for the otherbut Spielberg peppers one gripping action setpiece after another with trenchant details about a near-future robbed of the most basic freedoms and privacy.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,It's a dark and dazzling spectacle.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,"Where Minority Report succeeds is by dishing up a little bit of everything  to see no one leaves the theater disgruntled. There are helpings of science fiction marvel, theres some interminable tension and a real human story underneath it all. The specials effects are damn impressive to boot."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,"Terrifically entertaining specimen of Spielbergian sci-fi, incomparably better than ""A.I."" and as dark a movie as the director has made since ""Schindler's List."""
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,"This is a fiendishly complicated whodunit -- or, to be more precise, a who-done-what-to-whom-and-when -- told within the confines of thoughtful, speculative science-fiction."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,The film moves swiftly and unerringly to its conclusion. Spielberg remains under Stanley Kubrick's directorial spell.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,"The most compelling question dangling at its end is, ""Didn't Steven Spielberg used to know how to bring a movie to an end?"""
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,88,"Spielberg takes assured control. In his hands, Minority Report is a classy, chilly quasi-Hitchcockian affair."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,88,"The first 20 minutes are masterful, as Cruise hunts down a killer-to-be; the last 20 are mediocre, as screenwriters Scott Frank and Jon Cohen untangle the mystery they've grafted onto Dick's story. In between lies a conventional but expertly realized cop-on-the-run drama."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,83,"Spielberg's dark side may not be where everyone wants to live, but it's somehow encouraging to know that he has one."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,80,"May be a shade too serious and contemplative to completely enchant the thrill-seeking masses, while simultaneously seeming too mainstream-minded and genre-bound to be entirely embraced by highbrows."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,80,"It's not the crowning achievement in Steven Spielberg's oeuvre, but Minority Report stands on its own sturdy sci-fi legs, and there's no sign of that little imp Haley Joel Osment, to boot, thankfully."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,80,"Taut entertainment that juggles brainy ideas about perception, predetermination and free will - and drops things in a messy third act where the vintage noir gets bathed in a bit too much Spielbergian glow."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,80,"Cruise will never be a master thespian, but there's no one better at putting across the charisma of control, and the opening sequence of ''Report'' is an astonishingly fluid demonstration of his gifts."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,78,"Its most vivid scenes -- a visit with an insane ophthalmologist, a showdown at Anderton's supposed crime scene -- have the kind of anything-goes creativity that set ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" apart from the crowd last year."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,75,"The mechanical beauty and android possibilities of the future excite the filmmaker, and that's where Minority Report becomes an alluring postcard from the edge. But it's an edge over which Spielberg never seems to want to step."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,75,"Whose idea was it to turn Minority Report into a mushy declaration of humanism? It ends up as less of a warning about an Orwellian police state than a protest that Pre-Cogs are people, too. It's Dick-less."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,75,"Though he can still deliver an amazing scare, Mr. Spielberg's interest now leans more toward exposition rather than the anticipatory. He is explaining the fun away."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,75,One of the glummest and most forbidding thrillers ever.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,70,"It's not the kind of work that wins awards, but without Cruise's intensity almost willing our interest in Spielberg's unrelentingly dark world, Minority Report wouldn't have nearly as much life as it does."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,70,More humdrum than horrible. It isn't futuristic film noir; it's just everyday film beige.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,70,"We'll never know what might have been, as eye candy and food for thought replace real thrills in the cool but cold Minority Report."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,70,"Miscast, misguided, and often nonsensical, Minority Report is nevertheless the most entertaining, least pretentious genre movie Steven Spielberg has made in the decade since ""Jurassic Park."""
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,70,"Give Steven Spielberg some dinosaurs or a cute, funny alien and he'll spin populist sci-fi till the Arcturan cows come home. Give him a philosophical story about technology changing what it means to live in this world and he'll craft a hodgepodge of shallow and unexplored ideas."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,75,It's almost a surprise that the sequel is actually better - much better - than the original.
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,75,One of the most enjoyable pictures of the season.
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,67,"As summer franchise superhero flicks go, it's tolerable."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,67,What keeps the Fantastic Four franchise alive is the Human Torch's emotional fire and the Silver Surfer's melancholy ice.
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,67,"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, is . . . well . . . not terrible. In fact, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is roughly 300 percent less cringe-inducing than its predecessor."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,63,When will the people who adapt comic books into films realize that less can be so much more?
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,63,"Doesn't quite live up to the billing, but it improves mightily on the original. And the superhero family can thank its new addition for the upgrade."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,63,"Like its predecessor, this is a basic bungalow of a flick, where low-maintenance superheroes take their ease and you can pay your (dis)respects painlessly enough. In short, okay to visit, wouldn't want to live there."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,63,It's a decent comic-book movie that delivers its goods with good humor and a minimum of bloat.
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,60,"At a time when tortured superheroes like Spider-Man, Superman and Batman would benefit from some serious psychotherapy, it's almost refreshing to see a comicbook caper as blithe, weightless and cheerfully dumb as Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,60,"Bigger, better and more polished than the first, with a quite satisfactory ratio of action set-pieces and a lot of juvenile japery squarely aimed at its PG and fanboy audience."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,60,"It's miscast, underwritten, muddily shot, and slackly paced, but there's something captivating about its unabashed shittiness."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,50,"The script, credited to ""Twin Peaks"" co-creator Mark Frost and longtime ""Simpsons"" writer Don Payne, unsuccessfully strives for hipster irreverence."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,50,"It is passable comic book stuff, dumb and loud. Loud. LOUD."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,50,An improvement of sorts over the lifeless 2005 edition.
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,50,"Diverting, at times even visually impressive,  but has neither the spirit or style of ""Spider-Man"" nor the ambition of ""X-Men."""
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,50,"Earnest, gee-whiz and foursquare, this simple and intentionally inoffensive sequel gets points for being easy to take and scrupulously avoiding obvious sources of irritation."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,50,The result is strictly for those who like their comic-book movies short and stupid.
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,50,Good fun -- more fun than in the original -- punctuated by some lines of admirable awfulness.
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,50,"The silliest sci-fi movie since ""An Inconvenient Truth."""
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,50,"The early dilemma in ""Rise of the Silver Surfer "" is this: Save the world or marry Jessica Alba . Your conscience says, ""Save the world."" But the Maxim reader in you knows better."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,50,"A better-quality sequel, but that wasn't really too difficult. The original was one of the worst movies of 2005, and while ""Rise"" won't win any awards, it's (mostly) less offensive than its predecessor. Faint praise, but I'll be damned if I go any further than that."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,50,"Even within the context of the superhero universe, the Silver Surfer initially makes for -- let's face it -- a somewhat silly-looking creation."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,50,"The closest FF:ROTSS gets to wit is when Johnny convinces a reluctant Reed to attend a bachelor party, after promising the uptight groom-to-be that there won't be any ""exotic dancers."""
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,50,"More ambitious than its predecessor. It's also more cluttered and less fleet: The light, pleasingly casual quality of the first picture has evolved into something forced and metallic."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,42,"Purists will balk at a pointless--and boring--revamp of a major villain, but that's the least of the film's worries. Only a few isolated shots of the group striding together as a team make Surfer feel like a Fantastic Four movie."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,42,"The dialogue aims young and low, and sounds translated from comic-book Esperanto."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,38,"A tedious, incoherent bore."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,30,"This existentially and aesthetically unnecessary sequel to the equally irrelevant if depressingly successful ""Fantastic Four."""
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,30,Relentlessly dull and curiously bombastic.
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,30,"This sequel to ""Fantastic Four"" (2005) drags in the Silver Surfer, who looks like a gigantic hood ornament and, given voice by Laurence Fishburne, has about as much personality."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,25,"The perfect summer movie, that is if you're eight years old or under. For the rest of us, the sequel to the first ""Fantastic Four"" that miraculously amassed more than $150 million in 2005, is a plotless, brainless, witless bore."
4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,5.6,131921738,20,"Surely the dullest of Hollywood's many comic-book-derived summer movies, ""Silver Surfer"" is drearier than corn dying in the Iowa sun, slower than molasses in Antarctica."
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,80,"The characters remain funny and likable, and they all live on Earth."
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,80,"The quintessence of the buddy cop pic, ""LW4"" is big on action, playful banter and just enough plot to keep our attention from wandering."
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,75,"One could argue about which ""Lethal Weapon'' is the best, but No. 4 is certainly the funniest, warmest and most idiosyncratic."
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,75,I think the script by television writer Channing Gibson (no relation) is the funniest of them all.
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,75,"It's a calculated formula for success, and makes for entertaining viewing, but those expecting something with the spark of the first two pictures may be disappointed."
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,70,"The old hands still seem to be having a good time, so why the hell shouldnít we?"
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,63,"This movie is exceptionally brutal, cruel, savage and without conscience -- and that's just the comic parts. In contrast, the violent action sequences are quite entertaining."
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,60,Richard Donner's sequel is more than eager to please -- it's desperate.
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,60,Danny Glover and Mel Gibson make a gently contrasted (and nicely self-reflexive) odd couple in this action-comedy sequel.
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,60,"Part 4, to its credit, is the noisiest. Disappointingly, it's also the worst: not bad, just not as good."
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,50,"Lethal Weapon 4 has all the technical skill of the first three movies in the series, but lacks the secret weapon, which was conviction."
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,50,"Don't get your expectations up, but ""LW4"" is a decent enough date film."
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,50,"At the Lethal Weapon plant, what you see, after 11 years, are the rusting remnants of a once innovative model."
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,50,"The movie has homophobic touches, though, and with so many Asian characters, some viewers may wonder why every single one is portrayed as either a hapless victim or a wicked villain."
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,40,"It's take-the-money-and-run filmmaking, with the actors practically winking their dialogue at each other, and it's all supposed to be tongue-in-cheek fun. It isn't."
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,20,"Cynical and contemptuous of its audience, this lazy sequel oozes an insufferable air of self-satisfaction."
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,10,The most lethal weapon of all turns out to be the script.
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,10,It's a dead end to a franchise that should have been put to rest two movies ago.
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,0,"The result is a calculated, cynical piece of business that epitomizes the creative bankruptcy and contempt for the audience that infects so much of the blockbuster side of Hollywood."
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,0,"Not only is the franchise growing hoary, by now it's become downright laughable, leaving Lethal Weapon 4 feeling more like a bad Fox sitcom than anything else."
Lethal Weapon 4,6.6,130444603,0,"A stupid and violent delicacy, congealed nachos and Mountain Dew for the Beavis-and-Butt-head set."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,88,"For those looking for non-stop action, pretty dazzling special effects and solid acting by the young protagonists, Insurgent will not disappoint."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,75,"Taken for what it is, Insurgent is a vast improvement over the franchise’s first installment, mostly thanks to expansion in two arenas: budget and scope."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,70,"A more effective, adult-friendly film than its predecessor."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,70,"The second installment of the Divergent series shows some symptoms of middle chapter-itis but in the end makes the most of a strong returning cast led by Shailene Woodley, slick direction from Robert Schwentke, impressive effects and a closely guarded plot twist."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,67,"Schwentke keeps things lively and loud, with a mildly alarming body count, smashing glass and gunfire."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,63,Watts' Evelyn is a tricky character - it should be entertaining having her around in the cloven-in-two-to-cash-in-at-the-box-office final installments.
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,63,"There is, however, a certain urgency to the action that will prevent most people from noticing the film’s flaws."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,63,"It’s a sequel that sticks to more routine territory of action, angst, and dystopian gloom — mostly a sound approach, thanks to the consistent strength of franchise lead Shailene Woodley and a mix of intended and inadvertent surprises."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,63,"Directed by action specialist Robert Schwentke (“Red,” “Flightplan”), Insurgent surges along with capable set pieces but less meaningful human interaction than in “Divergent.”"
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,63,The actors are more or less saving this franchise's bacon. Insurgent is a tick or two livelier than the first one.
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,60,"A competent rather than classic follow-up. If the action feels generic at times, the addition of Watts, more Winslet and the strength of Woodley are worth watching."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,60,"At least [Teller's] presence, along with Woodley's, makes Insurgent good, if not great. And it's not too late to keep improving."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,60,"Once you swallow the giant pill that is the premise, it just about makes sense, and Woodley sells it with all her conviction."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,60,"There’s no question that the feature is a leaner, meaner affair than its predecessor. That’s not enough, though, to counterbalance the often oppressive self-seriousness (though Miles Teller gives it a welcome shot) or to plaster over the holes in the premise."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,50,Insurgent exists primarily to either validate or defy the imagined depiction of events in the heads of countless teen fans.
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,50,"Visually uninteresting, dramatically inert, and remarkably silly no matter how seriously it tries to play things straight, Insurgent is franchise management and little more."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,50,"In the battle between dystopian science-fiction movies about butt-kicking young heroines, the new Divergent movie, Insurgent, is actually slightly more believably glum than the third Hunger Games movie, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1."""
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,50,"Insurgent would be a much worse movie if the good parts were all at the beginning. But they are saved for the end, and they leave the viewer with a feeling of, “Well, that was OK,” even though most of it wasn’t."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,50,"Insurgent is more clumsy than bad, but it disappoints because it wastes the world-building of Divergent, which set the stage for something more momentous than what the sequel delivers."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,50,"Surprise is lacking. Ditto humor, though Miles Teller (Whiplash), as a thorn in Four's side, gets in a few fun licks by not staying on the film's draggy tempo. Otherwise, Insurgent stubbornly fails to surge."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,50,"Unfortunately, Insurgent can’t quite live up to its intriguing set up. Even if you’re curious about it, the movie is often plodding and frequently nonsensical, with action that never feels novel or exciting."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,50,"Steeliness comes naturally to, say, Jennifer Lawrence, but when Woodley unleashes the occasional voice-cracking battle cry, it generates tension between her desire for revolution and her utter believability as a teenager with more earnest ideals than ruthless training."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,50,A Little Golden Book version of drastically simplified socialism accompanied with a healthy dose of warmongering bravado.
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,50,The sequel to “Divergent” is the cinematic equivalent of the KFC Famous Bowl: a nutritionally devoid mishmash of elements and past films that somehow manages to be less than the sum of its parts once cobbled together.
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,50,"The fights are well-staged, the chases dull. But as Insurgent wraps up, it picks up speed and depth, and gives you hope that maybe this series won’t wrap up as the copy-and-paste “Hunger Games” it has felt like, from the moment the books were word-processed onto the best seller lists."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,50,"Considering that Insurgent is meant to represent the series’ great civil war, it all comes across feeling like a tempest in a teapot: a glorified rehash of what came before, garnished with the promise of what lies in store."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,40,"Insurgent is not a very good movie, but it’s better than it needs to be."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,40,"It’s wandering, not urgent, while indicating that all-Shailene-all-the-time can be too much of a pretty good thing."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,40,"Tighter, tougher and every bit as witless as its predecessor, The Divergent Series: Insurgent — the second segment in the cycle — arrives with a yawn and ends with a bang."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,40,What a waste of Shailene Woodley the Divergent franchise is turning out to be.
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,40,"It plays like a listless mash-up of every Young Adult franchise movie you’ve ever seen – domineering rulers, anguished, system-smashing teens, and all the purposeful striding through rubble you can handle."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,40,"Take everything annoying about a cobbled-together, overly familiar YA adaptation, add the built-in wheel-spinning of a sequel, and you’ve got Insurgent, a film that works best when it places its heroine inside virtual-reality situations — at least then it has an excuse for eschewing logic and context."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,38,"This second installment, based on Veronica Roth's series of YA novels, feels cobbled together and less focused than 2014's Divergent, and lacks tension and excitement."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,33,"If you think you've seen this movie, you have. Once it had a male protagonist and was called ""Harry Potter."" Then it starred Jennifer Lawrence and was called ""The Hunger Games."" Now it stars Shailene Woodley and goes by ""The Divergent Series."" Same thing, only worse."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,25,"You know you’re in for a long haul when Kate Winslet’s clipboard-wielding Jeanine, leader of the Erudite faction, comes off less like a Hillary Clinton than a weary Applebee’s supervisor at the end of a 14-hour shift in this plodding sequel to “Divergent.”"
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,20,"It doesn’t make any sense, but Insurgent demands its audience play along anyway. The problem is, the film doesn’t do enough to earn viewers’ trust, or reward it once it’s given."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,20,Every scene is entwined in clunkiness.
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,10,"Insurgent opens new horizons of repetitiveness, dramatic shapelessness, self-seriousness and a generalized oppressiveness that flows from all of the above as well as from visual clutter, cheerless color, 3-D dimness and plain old bad acting."
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,10,Insurgent is so vapid it seems impossible that there's enough story left for another sequel.
Insurgent,6.2,130179072,0,"There is such a thing as an infinitely bad movie, and this is it."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,80,"If you’re not staggered by the technique on display here – the stuff that sets Bay’s work miles above the Fast & Furiouses, X-Men: Apocalypses and Tom Cruise-chasing Mummies of this world – you’re not paying attention."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,75,It’s been reported that this “Transformers” sequel had a $217 million budget. The special effects — especially in IMAX 3-D — on the screen make you believe it.
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,60,"Clangorous and nonsensical, the fifth installment of the toys-to-world-saviors franchise still has a spark of grandeur that could only come from one director."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,60,"For the first time, the messy hyperactive form and nihilistic crunched-metal content seem to reinforce each other."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,58,"Monster metal, mass destruction, Anthony Hopkins saying “dude.” This is your brain on Michael Bay—a cortex scramble so amped on pyro and noise and brawling cyborgs it can only process what’s happening on screen in onomatopoeia: Clang! Pew-pew! Kablooey!"
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,50,Bay makes a lot of familiar moves here.
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,50,"The absolute tastelessness of Bay’s images, their stultifying service to platitudes and to merchandise, doesn’t at all diminish their wildly imaginative power."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,50,"If the film’s trio of new screenwriters (replacing series mainstay Ehren Kruger) have seamlessly upheld the crass and juvenile “Transformers” sensibility, then Bay’s visual sensibility has, if anything, matured, to the point of demanding and earning your exasperated surrender."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,50,"The more striking moments of The Last Knight—this is an ostentatious Michael Bay movie, after all—speak just as loudly to its director’s indifference to both source material and visual scale."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,50,"It’s an unabashed freewheeling mess of CGI explosions, fast-talking strategies and shiny metal monstrosities clashing in epic battles. And it’s actually kind of fun, in an infuriating sort of way, to watch the most ridiculous Hollywood movie of the year do its thing."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,50,This film’s sense of action geography and tactics is atrocious.
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,50,It's the little pleasures in mediocre movies that mean a lot.
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,50,"The fifth Transformers movie, The Last Knight, is far from the worst in this continuing experiment in noisy nonsense based on Hasbro toys. That is thanks largely to two words: Anthony Hopkins."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,43,"It’s beautiful, bombastic, and nearly indistinguishable from those that came before it."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,40,"Bay’s genuine determination to give you a good time still doesn’t result in fun. Overlong, overstuffed and soulless, for fans who grew up with Optimus and Co, The Last Knight will sting like a bee."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,40,"It’s all an overstuffed mess, but that was true of the previous entries as well, and audiences obviously don’t seem to mind."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,40,"By now you know exactly what to expect from a Transformers film: undeniably epic action spectacle at the cost of character, logic or genuine drama. Predictably formulaic."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,40,"The Last Knight is not, in any conventional sense, entertaining or good, although parts of it are spectacular."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,40,"Bay's latest Transformer title is a daunting behemoth of a film and you can feel every ounce of dead weight, as sins of the past are committed without any signs of stopping."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,40,"There’s fun to be had in The Last Knight, if you can find it among the chaos — and if you can remember it after the fact."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,40,The Last Knight is the loudest and most explosively dull installment yet.
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,38,"This is Bay’s world, and when faced with the end of the world, there’s only one message to be gleaned from this supposed finale of the “Transformers” franchise: The Mack trucks and the muscle cars will outlive us all."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,38,"For better or worse (emphasis on the latter), it was unlike anything else on the multiplex landscape. In 2017, it’s becoming difficult for Bay to distinguish his brand of brain-dead spectacle from the brain-dead spectacle of many other sequels, prequels, and remakes."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,38,"When words fail in The Last Knight, the crunching and crashing and KLANKing of the special-effects scenes take up the slack. Punishingly overwrought in every aspect, Last Knight is a KLANK! KLANK! KLUNKER."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,38,"The rhythmic assurance of truly bracing screen action, even if it's just a bunch of metal beating up a bunch of other metal, or clobbering humans, never gains traction. The cross-cutting suggests the editors took care of things via group text."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,30,"The Transformers movies are a favorite object of critical scorn, and narratively, The Last Knight remains barely coherent. But it’s more fun than ""Age of Extinction,"" though both movies are so drunk on money and effects they accidentally go weird."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,29,"All the signature Bay Movements are here, the slow-motion hero shots, the scale so vast that even planets look small and modest, the aggressively dorky jokes, but they all have a perfunctory feel, like even Bay couldn’t muster up much enthusiasm this time."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,25,"Watching “Transfomers” is like sitting in a car that’s revving its engine while stuck in the mud. It sounds like it’s getting somewhere, even though all it ever does is spin its wheels."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,25,"It’s easily the worst installment in this endlessly awful series, probably the worst movie of the summer."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,25,"Bay swipes elements from other popular movies and TV shows, such as “The Da Vinci Code,” “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” and “Game of Thrones.” This director’s motto? Throw everything at the wall and then blow that wall sky-high!"
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,25,The plot is a canvas on which to bludgeon the audience with action sequences that have been shot for maximum overstimulation.
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,25,It’s all about as exciting as watching two drawings fight each other on a computer monitor.
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,25,"Even if you love alien robots punching each other while tossing out insipid one-liners, it’s a painfully long two and a half hours where the biggest problem isn’t a lack of plot but way too many of them."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,25,"From the very beginning, this is an incoherent mess."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,20,"This series’ tone-deaf humour and dull nods to selfless heroism have become toxic irritants — a sensation not helped by the film’s collection of clattering, joyless robots and dopey humans."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,20,"It's bigger and louder and, if not longer (checking in at a mere two hours and 28 minutes), certainly stupider than ever before."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,20,"The final explosive showdown seems to be competing with Marvel movies for spectacle. But Marvel brings wit and fun. As far as those factors go, the Transformers franchise is in very short supply."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,20,"If you’re here for the director’s trademark chaos editing (where fights go from points A to D to Q), toxic masculinity (and female objectification), comedy scenes rendered tragic (and vice versa), and general full-volume confusion, you’ll get all those things in abundance."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,16,"While the flagrant product placement is dialed back (at least on Bay’s curve) and there’s mercifully 100% less discussion of sexual consent laws this time around, the latest outing suffers from arguably the most fatal flaw a movie about giant fighting robots can: it’s brutally and relentlessly boring from start to finish."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,16,"The Last Knight is like a Red Bull-charged Bay yelling “I regret nothing!” as he jumps out of a plane backwards with no chute, detonating a megaton nuclear explosive while firing Uzis at his skydiving pals above him because hell, dude, that sounds like a wicked fond farewell.

Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,91,This is a case of all the elements lining up and pushing a potentially good film into the great category because of just how well executed it is.
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,91,"Vaughn and his collaborators have taken a crude and disposable property and turned it into something more – a thoughtful, exciting, whip-smart spy adventure that doesn't let its smart-ass post-modernism overwhelm its playfulness or its heart."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,90,Kingsman: The Secret Service is a spy movie made by James Bond devotees who know the genre so well that they can have a good time with it while also paying it respect -- and taking it to someplace new entirely.
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,90,"Those more devoted to the genre can debate whether Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman is the best comic-book movie of the last few years. What's beyond argument, however, is that Vaughn has whipped up the most interesting one, the only to make ferocious, unsettling art out of the great contradiction of superheroic fantasy: jolly do-goodism and its brutalizing sadism."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,88,"Firth is brilliant. He’s playing a veteran super spy in a very violent but very silly movie, but even when Harry is explaining why there’s a dead stuffed dog in his bathroom, Firth gives a disciplined, serious performance."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,80,"A brazen, subversive send-up of 007, Kingsman: The Secret Service also has the high-octane excitement to work as a spy film on its own merits."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,80,"Things go from far-fetched to insane before it's over, and Vaughn wisely keeps the pace at a healthy clip. But never underestimate his power to floor you."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,80,"Firth might appear like an odd choice for an action hero, but he makes a surprisingly convincing one in the Roger Moore mold, the sort of unflappable British gentlemen who can kick your ass without wrinkling his suit. He’s a great straight man for Jackson and some of the movie’s sillier elements as well; Firth has this unshakeable dignity and poise that even the most vulgar moments in Kingsman can’t puncture."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,80,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is so well served in terms of gags, action and style that it bodes well for another savvy spy franchise and even more so for the star potential of Taron Egerton."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,80,"Injecting fun and fairground thrills back into the spy movie, Kingsman is a blast. Firth is sensational, Jackson rules and newcomer Egerton surprises. Mission accomplished for Matthew Vaughn."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,80,"Despite the presence of grandfatherly Michael Caine, Kingsman’s tone is about as far from the Christopher Nolan-style superhero film as you can get. Verisimilitude is frequently traded in for a rich laugh. The action scenes delight with shock humour."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,80,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is a startlingly enjoyable and well-made action film leavened by humor and slicked along by style, made by, for, and about people who’ve seen far too many Bond films."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,80,"Perhaps the riskiest mainstream movie in years, Vaughn’s love letter to spy movies may be uneven in places, but it’s ultra-violent, envelope-pushing, and fun enough to overcome the flaws."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,78,"Kingsman: The Secret Service may lack the sophistication of its peers, but damned if it doesn’t know how to have a good time."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"At heart, “Kingsman” is a comedy, though granted, one with abundant dismemberments and literally mind-blowing violence. And I mean “literally” in the very strictest sense of the term."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"Kingsman is as violently kinetic as anything Vaughn has made, a list including Kick-Ass (the good one) and Craig's U.S. breakthrough, Layer Cake. But Kingsman is also wildly uneven, often slowing its roll to stiff-upper-lip pacing necessary (or not) to create a new British secret agent movie mythology."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"Fast-paced with a morbid sense of humor and copious pop culture references, Kingsman breezes along at a nice clip until it gets a little bogged down during its final third."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"A lively, dashing and amusing motion picture that smartly spoofs and slyly celebrates the James Bond spy-film franchise."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"It’s also a movie that further establishes Vaughn as one of the edgier and more underrated genre voices of the moment, and that makes us wonder why Colin Firth hasn’t indulged in an action sideline all along."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"Kingsman delivers on its promise of escapist fun, with a touch that alternates between Galahad’s old-school polish and Eggsy’s roguish charm. Like the rookie who knows that you have to make a few mistakes while following the master, the movie shrugs off its missteps with a wink and a smile that makes them easy to forgive."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"Mashing up satire, subtle social commentary, clever gadgetry, keen wit and high-octane style, this spy saga — based on the comic book series The Secret Service — is bolstered by a terrific cast."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"OK, got it. It's a spy movie spoof, ""Austin Powers"" with more violence and less camp, a Bond parody that zeroes in on the Roger Moore era, when the sets and gadgets got bigger and the stories got dumber."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"Kingsman is all over the place, sometimes to its detriment. But you won’t want to miss the surprises it delights in springing."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"Speaking of young men, newcomer Taron Egerton, playing Harry’s protégé, delivers a star-making performance flush with the kind of charm and unexpected gravitas that no amount of flashy filmmaking can fake."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,70,"It's a lot of fun. But there's also something very bizarre about Kingsman. Namely, its politics are incredibly strange, wildly vacillating between a kind of egalitarian progressivism and the equivalent of shrugging wildly and saying, ""Who cares! The status quo is fine!"""
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,70,"Kingsman is full of elaborately orchestrated violence and acrobatic stunt work, shot in fast, sinewy, CGI-enhanced long takes that push and pull our perspective this way and that. It’s all very silly and not really meant to be taken seriously, but as the story gets more and more brutal, something strange happens: We start to care for these cartoonish characters and this absurd scenario."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,70,"Directed by ""Kick-Ass"" action specialist Matthew Vaughn with slightly more vigor than necessary and a shade less restraint than needed, it's a bit too too to be ""brilliant,"" as the Brits say. But it's not half bad either."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,70,"Director Matthew Vaughn strikes an energetic balance between cartoonish action and character-driven drama... The mix grows less seamless and the story loses oomph as it barrels toward its doomsday countdown, but the cast’s dash and humor never flag."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,70,"While seriousness has overtaken the Bond franchise in recent years (hardly a bad thing, mind you), Kingsman runs no such risk. Vaughn welcomes details that might seem silly in another director’s hands, such as a bulletproof umbrella or tiny microchips that can make one’s head explode, presenting everything playfully enough that plausibility isn’t a factor."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,67,"Camping it up, Jackson is hilarious."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,67,"A live-action Hammacher Schlemmer catalog of pseudo-retro novelties, spiced up with self-aware asides and over-the-top violence — slick entertainment, provided the viewer turns off whatever part of their brain is responsible for recognizing and parsing subtext."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,60,"The film never entirely figures out what it wants to do with the myth of the superspy, but at least it has fun along the way."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,60,"Never less than slick, precision-tooled multiplex entertainment, Kingsman hews close to the formula Vaughn and his co-writer Jane Goldman established in their superficially similar ""Kick-Ass"": hyperspeed action, pithy one-liners and grotesque ultraviolence."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,58,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is a modestly entertaining romp that will probably delight those who like to see a genre turned upside down so all its lunch-money lands on the ground, and purveyors of kinetic and no-holds barred gore will also get a treat."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,50,"Director Matthew Vaughn’s latest film, Kingsman: The Secret Service, is an attempt at finding a balance somewhere between Austin Powers and James Bond that doesn’t quite succeed."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,50,"On many levels, Kingsman has the makings of a sure-fire hit. Yet, this is one spy story even the most dedicated addicts of the genre would do well to miss."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,50,"It sounds fun in theory, I guess, and there are some entertaining moments of rude irreverence here and there but the giddiness gets a bit tedious after a while."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,50,"Mr. Firth gives his all, and then some. He’s very funny, even touching, when the material allows him to be. Yet the production, directed by Matthew Vaughn (“Kick-Ass,” “X-Men: First Class”) from a screenplay he wrote with Jane Goldman, can’t contain its centrifugal force."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,50,"It tries to get by on charm, and like a lot of movies, and people who make that attempt, “Kingsman” does have charm — just not enough."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,50,"As February comic book movies go, this works well enough to make you glad they didn’t cook up another “Ghost Rider.”"
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,50,"This is pitiful stuff, and, like the violence, it eats away at the blitheness for which Kingsman strives, leaving an aftertaste of desperation that the Connery of “Goldfinger,” say, would not have dreamed of bequeathing. The sadness is that Firth, alone in the film, does raise the spectre of those days, radiating a lightly amused reserve amid the havoc."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,40,"The problem is that Mr. Vaughn has no interest in, or perhaps understanding of, violence as a cinematic tool. He doesn’t use violence; he squanders it."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,40,"Half amusing and half appalling, Matthew Vaughn’s shameless spy caper Kingsman: The Secret Service is ultimately done in by its own hypocrisy."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,40,"Yet for all Vaughn’s attention to stylized details, I noticed a number of obvious continuity errors throughout to which Vaughn seems blind."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,38,"Kingsman is like a high-speed collision between a Jaguar and a jaywalking soccer hooligan. It’s ridiculously out of balance, and when you’re stuck in the middle, it doesn’t seem so funny."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,38,"Silly, sadistic and finally a little galling, Kingsman: The Secret Service answers the question: What would Colin Firth have been like if he'd played James Bond?"
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,25,"Kingsman: The Secret Service borrows the tone, story, characters and humor of “Kick-Ass,” only this time in a 007 world instead of Batman’s. Nearly everything it does, it does poorly: This one is “Weak-Ass.”"
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,25,"Expensive, derivative and boring as mattress ticking masquerading as designer fabric."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,25,"It's tructured in familiar, safe terms, plays for very low stakes, and appeals to no one so much as white, male teenagers with chips on their shoulders."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,20,"The more calculated Vaughn’s films are to appeal to his surprisingly rabid fan-base, the more they seem custom-built to repel everyone else."

Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"This is a great movie, but it needs a sales job because it's in Mandarin."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"Soaring and romantic, wild and serene, feminist and gutsy, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the best movies of the year."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"Transcends its origins and becomes one of a kind. It's glorious, unashamed escapism and surprisingly touching at the same time."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"The landscapes are so gorgeous, the philosophy so richly appealing, the narrative so epically sweeping, and the characters so intense."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,This is a waking dream of truly operatic dimensions.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,The class act of action movies.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,Brilliance of the action and effects are supplemented by a consistently superior and resourceful score by Tan Dun.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,The picture is more fun than it has a right to be.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,My first viewing left me dazzled but slightly confused; a second deeply impressed; a third rhapsodic. I wish I hadn't needed to rediagram it in my head to turn it into the masterpiece it so obviously wants to be.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"Crouching Tiger's blend of the magical, the mythical and the romantic fills a need in us we might not even realize we had."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,The first Ang Lee film I've seen that I've liked without qualification.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,Magnificently nonchalant about its magic.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,Has the sprawling canvas of an epic and the emotional heat of classical melodrama.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"A masterful synthesis of generic conventions and creative imagination, a sublime amalgam of some of the best tendencies and talent our times have to offer."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,The film satisfies on both visceral and emotional levels.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,90,Crouching Tiger's dramatic line is so blurry that the central character is only a bystander to the climactic fight between forces of good and evil.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,90,"There's so much dreamy beauty in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon that it's almost like a narcotic."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,90,"What about Ronny Yu's 1992 masterpiece ""The Bride With White Hair,"" of which Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a decent facsimile?"
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,90,"The film may be too talky for action-minded viewers and too fantastic for more serious spectators, but it brings appealing twists - including a feminist sensibility - to the venerable martial-arts genre."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,88,"The best thing about this movie is that you believe in the relationship. Hart and Johnson are a classic comedy duo in the tradition of Abbott & Costello, Bob Hope & Bing Crosby and Gene Wilder & Richard Pryor."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,75,"Central Intelligence is genuinely funny, intriguingly plotted, and quite frankly one of the biggest surprises of the year."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,75,What makes Central Intelligence appealing in appalling times is volcanic chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,70,"Central Intelligence won’t blow you out of the theater, but you might be surprised at how well it works — how genuinely funny it is — given the familiarity of this concept."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,70,"Central Intelligence is dumb in all the right ways, and also a bit smarter than you might expect."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,67,"Central Intelligence manages to be a far more coherent comedy than I would have expected, and it’s a worthy representation of the genre."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,63,Central Intelligence is actually funny.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,63,There’s such a genuine sweetness to Johnson you can’t help digging the shtick.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,63,"Central Intelligence won’t win any points for originality, but that doesn’t make it any less funny."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,63,"It dawdles between action beats and big laughs, and in the third act, that lets much of the wind out of it."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,"There may not have been such an awkwardly homoerotic bromance-seduction on film since Jim Carrey molested Matthew Broderick in The Cable Guy, but it’s one of Central Intelligence’s redeeming features that it’s generously forgiving, rather than nastily phobic, of Bob’s quirks."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,This is a much better comedy than it is an action movie.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,"You come to this movie hoping that Johnson and Hart make you laugh. Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don’t. The hit-to-miss ratio is higher than you might expect, and both actors could accurately be described as pleasant, if not especially creative."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,"Thank the movie gods for Dwayne Johnson, who delivers a performance of such charm, such unexpected goofiness that the screen practically glows every time he appears."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,"The result, while instantly forgettable, is a fundamentally pleasurable experience."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,"Central Intelligence demonstrates an above-average interest in story and character, and tries, if not always successfully, to craft real comic situations and action sequences. It's been made with a certain level of polish and professionalism. And it capitalizes on the chemistry between Hart and Johnson."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,58,"Nearly (but not quite) redeemed by its good nature and the megaton charisma of its two stars, Central Intelligence is a dopey blockbuster diversion that will surely keep United Airlines passengers entertained during the dog days of summer."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,58,"While not necessarily a diamond-in-the-rough itself, Central Intelligence proves that Johnson has always been at the center of his own ring, in more ways than one. It just took the rest of us (and Hollywood) a little longer to notice."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,58,"Central Intelligence doesn’t feel like the birth of a great comic duo — more like a blind date that goes a little better than expected. The chemistry’s not there yet, but let’s give it another shot."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"By the time the film reaches its obvious conclusion – by the time Hart expends more energy than Bugs Bunny, by the time the espionage plot twists itself into corners too convoluted for even ""Homeland"" fans, by the time Thurber exhausts the audience by unleashing cameo after cameo – it’s only Johnson who remains standing tall."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"The film itself is painless, strained, occasionally amusing, and utterly disposable — just another studio buddy comedy/action movie that forgot where it put the script."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"It’s straightforward, it’s pretty funny and it stars two good actors who seem to be trying really hard to leave audiences satisfied."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,Central Intelligence always takes the lazy way out. You go along for the ride because Hart and Johnson promise something they can't deliver: a movie as funny as they are.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"While it fails to deliver convincing action and its comedy feels watered down, Central Intelligence does get the “buddy” aspect correct. Doing their best with a script (also by Ike Barinholtz and David Stasser) that feels all-too-safe, Johnson and Hart manage to prove that a movie can glide by just enough on sheer charisma alone."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"The blend of Johnson’s laid-back hero-dudeness and Hart’s whippet-fast comic timing should have been good fun. But somebody, alas, had an idea, though not a good one: Make Johnson the comedian and Hart the straight man."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"It delivers — on some basic, giddy, turn-off-your-frontal-lobes level. It’s an action-comedy utensil, like “Rush Hour” crossed with an old Arnold Schwarzenegger shoot-’em-up, with a few goofy added sprinkles of “Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion.”"
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,It's a pity that no one else involved in the making of the film had Dwayne Johnson's sly intuition.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,42,"Any time the duo build up a significant amount of energy, the messy mechanics of the story come barreling in, shifting the narrative attention to the tedious developments involving encryption keys, which is nothing more than a Macguffin to begin with."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,42,"That it manages to score a good laugh every couple of minutes is mostly a credit to stars Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart, who make for a better mismatched-buddy comic duo than the movie probably deserves."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,40,An action comedy without any action or comedy – not even The Rock’s charisma and enthusiasm can save this dud.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,40,Even the obligatory blooper reel after the film isn’t as funny as it should be.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,40,An odd-couple caper of staggering dopeyness that makes you long for the snap and sizzle of the buddy movies of the 1980s.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,40,"A throwaway film that in all the worst ways give summer movies a bad name: told by idiots, full of sound and fury, and signifying nothing but first-weekend grosses."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,38,"Central Intelligence is one of those slick, gunplay-riddled, stupidly plotted, aggressively loud buddy movies — so formulaic and dumb, even if you see it you’ll probably forget you’ve seen it by the end of the year...And if that’s the case, consider yourself fortunate."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,25,"With its canned, predictable action sequences and mirthless attempts at humor, it displays an ineptitude that is frankly shocking considering the talent involved."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,88,"A splendid comic thriller, exciting and graceful, endlessly inventive."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,83,"Despite a few places where the air of déjà vu is a bit too thick, it's a class act, with a textured script, one of the series' more stunning title sequences."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,80,Whatever its flaws -- and it has some lulus -- it's a textbook model for how to structure action of this kind.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,80,Puts the Bond film series (this one makes number 19)-- back on track by stressing the fundamentals and applying a bit of authentic drama for a change.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,75,"There's nothing special, shocking, or precedent-setting about the film, but it functions on a level that 007 fans will appreciate - as eye and ear candy for those who prefer action to exposition and character development."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,75,Fans will appreciate not only that the film is predictably solid and surprisingly sharp but that parts of it are just plain bad.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,75,There's the script -- and that's the problem.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,75,You can't beat a Bond film for adventure on a grand scale.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,75,"A thoroughly satisfying, completely entertaining film that's also, rather surprisingly, an emotionally full experience."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,75,"That's what Bond is all about -- dazzle, some really bad puns and the kind of sexy fun that satisfies high-school urges while masquerading in tux and tails."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,75,Comes closer to what a Bond movie should be and once was.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,70,Isn't quite enough to save the Bond franchise -- but it does prove that 007 is Y2K-compliant.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,70,Not enough to add up to a fully satisfying movie.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,70,"The formula, with its comforting arrangement of familiar elements, is what we're after, and The World Is Not Enough certainly comes through on that front."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,67,"Apted (""Gorillas in the Mist,"" ""Coal Miner's Daughter"") keeps things low-key and low-tech, which makes some of the cliched Bondisms a bit easier to swallow."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,63,"Fair, overlong James Bond from the second shelf."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,63,"The movie's already peaked, even before the opening credits."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,63,"Spoofing James Bond in the '90s may lack an original comic bite, but making James Bond in the '90s is positively toothless."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,63,"This 19th Bond installment is passable, but only just."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,"Brosnan brings an intelligence and wit, together with a lightness, to the role - his softly Celtic vowels pleasingly reminiscent of Sean - along with a plausible virility Roger Moore never quite managed. And Pierce wears some beautifully tailored suits as to the manor born."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,"The World Is Not Enough is, without a doubt, a solidly entertaining chapter in the Bond franchise's chequered history. But while Apted fiddles with the format, this is far from an overhaul of the blueprint, and so lacks the whiff of freshness long-time fans may have been sniffing for."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,"The latest 007 extravaganza has enough plot developments, double-entendres, emotional underpinnings and, of course, Bond girls, action scenes and explosions to furnish at least a couple of Bondfests, with plenty left over for an episode of Nash Bridges."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,"This keeps one reasonably amused, titillated, and brain-dead for a little over two hours."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,"In his third and most comfortable effort to model the Bond mantle, Pierce Brosnan bears noticeably more resemblance to a real human being."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,There still is enough tightly staged action and sly humor to earn this latest installment a memorable place in Bond canon.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,007 is undone by villainous scripting and misguided casting and acting in a couple of key secondary roles.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,"The hero himself has been denatured for a young, late 1990s audience with little appreciation for real suavity or sex play."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,"If moviegoers really thought about the violence, sexism, and materialism at the core of the series, the whole shebang might vanish overnight."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,"The movie is better than you've heard, although that's not saying a lot."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,"If Bond long ago became part of your fantasy life or your pop iconography, then the anticipation of a good Bond movie would probably survive even if The World Is Not Enough were worse than it is."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,"The World Is Not Enough, like a 19th version of anything, is inanely self-parodic. So much so that one wonders why Austin Powers need have bothered in the first place."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,Makes the strongest case for retirement since late-period Roger Moore.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,"The new Bond movie is pure nonsense art of the dadaist school; it follows the rules of the ridiculous as it turns narrative convention, thriller formula and special-effects set pieces into a manifesto of the purest gibberish."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,45,James Bond hasn't been this boring since Timothy Dalton carried the license to kill.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,40,Bond spends an awful lot of time being rescued from peril by supporting characters.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,40,Solid 007 entertainment -- not as bad as some of the recent Bonds but not as spunky as some of the series' originals.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,20,"Most of all, though, I wondered how much longer people will pay to see a walking, running, driving, diving, punning, smirking, swimming, skiing, shooting, parachuting corpse."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,19,"If you're desperate for a James Bond fix, skip the movie and blow your 007 bucks on a copy of the soundtrack."
Smokey and the Bandit,6.9,126737428,70,"The direction, by a former stuntman, concentrates on the action and happily leaves everyone to their own devices, with almost nothing to do. Field shows what natural acting is all about, and Reynolds' send-ups of himself are, despite repetition, becoming more likeable. Here his kidding around is exactly in tune with this fast-moving but essentially lazy vehicle."
Smokey and the Bandit,6.9,126737428,60,"While the joke wears thin very quickly, there are a number of amusing sequences, which are combined with some exciting road action to provide a mildly entertaining — and totally mindless — film."
Smokey and the Bandit,6.9,126737428,50,"With Mr. Reynolds playing it cool and Mr. Gleason doing his burns and investing the film with a certain raunchy humor, the rest is up to the vehicles. And they don't do anything that hasn't been seen before."
Smokey and the Bandit,6.9,126737428,50,"The stunts in Smokey are excellent but the comedy is numbing, and the acting is on a par with a junior high school production of Our Town. Even Gleason comes across badly, and that's a major feat. Adolph Coors and Sons must have been very happy to have a 97-minute commercial for their brew."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,90,"The summer’s best, coolest, juiciest, smartest action movie."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,90,"It's gleefully bold, visually adventurous, often funny, strikingly concise — the whole heart-pounding tale is over in 90 minutes — and 100% entertaining."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,83,"It comes across, instead, as a directorial flight of fancy, an imaginatively goofy take on an already goofy idea, exaggerated by Besson’s blunt style and an uncommonly fast pace."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,83,"It's basically the perfect summer movie, because it's designed to be."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,80,"This undeniably silly, but raucously entertaining, off-the-wall transhumanist actioner is an absolute riot."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,80,"Besson is at his balls-out bonkers best in this genre-scrambling, mind-expanding exhilarator."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,80,It’s the blockbuster of the summer.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,80,"Lucy is insane, makes very little sense, doesn't stand up to scrutiny and is an absolute blast."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,78,"The best comic-book movie in a long time, though based on no comic, Lucy is a film that mates classic Besson with Quentin Tarantino in a go at the mystical, world-solving vision found in Stanley Kubrick’s ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and Terrence Malick’s ""The Tree of Life."""
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"What Johansson does in Lucy won't win her any prizes, but it establishes her ability to carry a movie that has some ideas, however half-baked, and has nothing to do with her obvious sex appeal."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"When it comes to sheer comic-book fun, few summer movies deliver a more consistent, satisfying, thoroughly enjoyable shot of cinematic jouissance than the delightfully adventurous actress Scarlett Johansson's latest bit of strange, Lucy."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"Like many films by Besson — ""The Professional,"" ""The Fifth Element,"" ""The Messenger"" and other high-octane shoot-'em-ups — Lucy starts out riveting but becomes less engaging as it goes along."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,Lucy is what a superhero movie might look like if developed by Spike Jonze and/or Michael Gondry.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"Scarlett Johansson is ideally cast as a rapidly evolving kick-ass hero in Lucy, a stylish action thriller that is equal parts dazzling and ludicrous."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"It’s all ridiculous and enjoyable, and at the movie’s center is an actress creatively guessing at what omniscience might feel like."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"A full-out action movie - and a sober rumination on the nature of existence. It is both things, effectively and sincerely."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"In a captivating climax, the movie turns attractively freaky, though somewhat marred by cheesy special effects, and there’s a huge debt to the immense leaps of “2001.” An abrupt ending feels frustrating and leaves questions floating in space. Then again, I’m using only 3 to 5 percent of my capacity, so what do I know?"
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"By the time the film exhausts itself—in a brisk 89 minutes — it feels like there's literally nowhere that Lucy and Besson can't go, no boundaries, no laws, no logic. Just go with it."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"Vulgar auteurist Luc Besson finally commits wholeheartedly to his decades-long preoccupation with waifish young women discovering their inner Shiva, spinning the concept out to its most delirious possible extremes."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,70,An outlandishly entertaining mixture of high silliness and high style.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,70,"There are a number of terrific production numbers in Lucy, basically violent action scenes that border on slapstick, and as long as we agree in advance that the “science” in this movie goes beyond pseudo into total B.S., I believe you will leave satisfied."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,70,"Buoyed by Ms. Johansson’s presence, Mr. Besson keeps his entertainment machine purring. He may be a hack, but he’s also a reliable entertainer."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,70,"Giddily recycling everything from “2001: A Space Odyssey” and “The Matrix” to yakuza actioners and National Geographic documentaries, it’s a garish, trippy, wildly uneven and finally quite disarming piece of work, graced by a moment-to-moment unpredictability."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,67,"Lucy doesn't hold together, but with its flashy innovation, Besson's trying to freshen the formula. It's the kind of freewheeling mess of a movie you wish studios would try out more often."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,63,"Lucy, you may have twigged, is named after our 3.2-million-year-old hominid ancestor."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,63,"Although Besson, the director of “La Femme Nikita” and the producer of “Taken,” indulges in some operatic violence, the film is more spacey than pacey."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,63,"Besson’s script may let her (and Freeman) down in the third act, but the 89 minute long Lucy is so brisk it’ll give you whiplash. Even marginal thrillers benefit from a director and star who have a sense of urgency and are as hellbent as this on not overstaying their welcome."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,60,"This ridiculous, highly watchable, at points startlingly psychedelic action thriller is probably Luc Besson’s best film since ‘Léon’ (which isn’t saying a great deal)."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,60,What begins as a thrilling pastiche of comic-book formula gets bogged down in its own scientific prattle — not that you ever stop adoring Johansson’s magnificent heroine.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,60,"Lucy earns points for its unpredictable treatment of its vaguely superhero-ish premise and an appealing silliness, but it struggles to match wits with the genius at its center."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,60,"The end of the movie goes completely off the rails, but in a way that is charming in its stupidity."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,58,Whether you take to it will depend on whether you consider “high-octane” or “nonsense” the more important word.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,58,"There are moments of real wonder and even beauty amidst the slam and the bang and the big bada boom, and while Lucy is a mixed bag, it's been mixed by a master, and it is delightfully, happily insane."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,52,"Even Besson’s most bold choices – and this is a film that goes weird, and then just keeps getting weirder – don’t seem so revolutionary when packaged in such well-tread trappings and increasingly shoddy writing."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,"I know we’re supposed to think that Besson’s daffy cinematic calisthenics are entertaining because at least they are not boring. But I was bored. It didn’t help that Morgan Freeman shows up as a brainy scientist explaining everything to us in his deepest intonations. When was the last time Freeman, a great actor, really acted?"
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,"An entertainment choice I wouldn’t recommend, but one you might not regret if you dial your expectations down (or your drug intake up)."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,"When everything and anything is possible, nothing feels urgent or truly dramatic. The movie devolves into a melange of digital effects and sequences of glamorous slaughter, as Lucy swaggers around, with that big brain, and slouches toward becoming a full-lipped deity."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,The junk in Lucy doesn't entirely eclipse the moments when weird is fun.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,"Remember ""Limitless,"" the 2011 thriller in which Bradley Cooper becomes a whirling killer dervish from a drug that lets him access 100 percent of his brain? Well, Lucy is basically the same movie with Scarlett Johansson in the Cooper role. It's not a good trade-off."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,"Lucy is a confounding experience, but at a brisk 85 or so minutes, it manages not to outstay its welcome. Those not enamored of Besson's particular brand of Euro-schlock grindhouse existentialism, however, may find their brains more stimulated elsewhere."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,40,"A brazenly mindless thriller about the infinite capacities of the human brain.
That said, sometimes we just want to shut down and give in to bombastic summer entertainment. In that regard, as usual, Besson delivers."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,40,"There's enough mumbo jumbo about space and time and cellular division to allow Lucy to feign depth, but what lingers is Besson's regressive belief that even the most intelligent woman on earth can't figure out how to get her way without a miniskirt and a gun."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,40,Lucy plays more like a big dumb superhero flick than sci-fi.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,20,"The funny thing about all these sub-""Matrix"" shenanigans is that they’re genuinely meant to stoke thought and reflection. Frankly, though, few movies have left me feeling as shorn of gray matter."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,12,"Besson has always demonstrated the ability to chuckle at the madness of his own material, and he provides some solid laughs from time to time. But these winks do nothing to erase the reality of a plot that becomes unintentionally hilarious."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,80,"The Legend of Tarzan has a whole lot of fun, big-screen things going for it — adventure, romance, natural landscapes, digital animals and oceans of rippling handsome man-muscle. Its sweep and easy pleasures come from its old-fashioned escapades — it’s one long dash through the jungle by foot, train, boat and swinging vine — but what makes it more enjoyable than other recycled stories of this type is that the filmmakers have given Tarzan a thoughtful, imperfect makeover."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,80,"The Legend of Tarzan isn't half-bad; actually, it's pretty good. Beautifully made and smartly set at the beginning of Belgian King Leopold II's rapacious colonization of the Congo in the 1880s, this is certainly the best live-action Tarzan film in many a decade (which, admittedly, isn't saying much) and offers a well-judged balance of vigorous action and engaging-enough drama."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,75,"Director David Yates, who did the last four “Harry Potter” films, delivers both big thrills at the climax and small, spooky ones when Tarzan and the others move through a world of beauty, terror and mystery."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,75,"Unlike so many of the bloated, disappointing entries into the 2016 big budget sweepstakes, this is good escapist entertainment."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,75,"You have to admire the sheer physical scope of this epic, even if there are no animals in it."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,68,"Waltz is the perfect villain in this setting: He's played this exact role before, as the smug, drawling, creepy aesthete who rarely stops smiling. But he's also capable of pivoting on a dime between real menace and garish, performative evil, between playing a subdued charmer, and the kind of movie-serial baddie who ties women to railroad tracks."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,67,"As much as I enjoyed this bizarre, ambitious adventure and its careful popcorn kitsch, Tarzan’s story will always leave our ears ringing with something we hate, whether you choose Burroughs’s white-savior syndrome or Christoph Waltz’s shivery final speech: “The future belongs to me.”"
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,67,"As it turns out, The Legend of Tarzan isn’t half-bad, and the film deftly put most of my fears to rest by creating animals and jungles that serve and enhance the story rather than detracting from it."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,67,"You just wish — after two solid but oddly joyless hours — that Legend strained less to hit its marks, and swung a little more."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,63,"It's a heavy thematic load for a single movie to handle — especially this one, which nearly collapses from its burden. But it's hard to fault director David Yates, who captained the last four Harry Potter movies, for having ambition."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,63,"There’s always been something a bit ridiculous about the whole Tarzan premise, and while the talented cast and a solid director make for a serviceable and intermittently entertaining adventure, there’s very little about this film that screams, YOU GOTTA SEE THIS."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,60,"The fights are quick and brutal and bloodless, with too much slo-mo and sped-up stuff, and some clever camera angles that get cut from before you can work out what you're looking at."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,60,"Skarsgård himself is fairly bland as Greystoke, delivering a po-faced Byronic spin on the character, all velvet coats and dreamy romantic stares at his belle while sitting barefooted in the boughs of trees. But at least the animals are memorable – best of all is a pack of scene-stopping silverback gorillas digitally created for the movie. This Tarzan isn’t quite the jungle VIP – but it’s got a little swing."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,58,It’s nice that The Legend Of Tarzan isn’t a nakedly mercenary franchise play that presumes dozens of sequels to come. (It’s also not a low-rent Casper Van Dien vehicle.) But it sure could use some money-grubbing set pieces to tie the genial silliness together.
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"The set pieces are fun, if not as spectacular as those in Jon Favreau's adaptation of Kipling's similar ""The Jungle Book."" And the plot moves at a nice pace."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"There’s also not much chemistry between Skarsgard and Robbie in a film that hints at the Greystokes’ great sex life but barely shows it. Instead, we get flashes of flesh that are hilariously dated in their obviousness."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"Its theme of white man as savior of black Africans is, to say the least, highly anachronistic in these days and times."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"While it looks great with its gorgeous computer-generated foliage and realistic animals, the story focuses too much on its stiff hero and a one-note villain rather than the big-picture ideas it raises in passing."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"The Legend of Tarzan isn’t as singularly joyless as many of this summer’s other current offerings, but it also feels distinctly like a missed opportunity. Even when Skarsgård offers up the character’s famous jungle cry, it sounds more mournful than enthusiastic, and that sentiment seeps into the entire enterprise."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"For what it's worth, The Legend of Tarzan is several unpretentious cuts above the pompous, leaden ""Greystoke"" of over thirty years ago."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"The result is a “Legend” that feels inoffensively modern, or at least less offensive than it could have been...But you can’t make a bold statement or exciting action picture when every frame is filled with fear — of offending someone, of upsetting animal rights activists, of giving the audience a Tarzan they won’t recognize, of failure."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,42,"Tarzan is too dull to offer consistent pulp excitement, too self-serious to let itself have fun, and too reliant on same-y CG spectacle to truly thrill."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,42,"Filmmakers simply can't make Tarzan like they used to. If someone tries, like director David Yates did with The Legend of Tarzan, he's just another superhero, swinging on vines rather than spider webs. Natives can't be restless. Lions won't be wrestled...Tarzan fans leave feeling Cheetah'd."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,Robbie lights up her scenes with the much more special effect of raw personality.
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"The new Tarzan film, The Legend of Tarzan, plays as if a dog ate part of the script."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"As written by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer, The Legend of Tarzan alternates between a brazenly contemporary sensibility and quietly time-honored events. Unfortunately, almost all of the former are awkward while the latter still ring true."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"""Unfun"" isn't a real word, but boy, it sure describes The Legend of Tarzan."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"Not so much a ripping yarn, more of a dripping yarn, Yates’ reinterpretation of the Lord Of The Jungle is a big disappointment."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"Alexander Skarsgard is more abs than actor as the ape man, and Margot Robbie's Jane looks about as 19th-Century as an Aussie surfer girl. Together, they produce all the real-life passion of an Abercrombie & Fitch ad."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"The Legend of Tarzan ends up being a garbled, clunky production that tries to please everyone and ends up pleasing no one."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"As a brand, Burroughs’ hero has always been schlocky, and no amount of psychological depth or physical perfection can render him otherwise if the filmmakers can’t swing a convincing interaction between Tarzan and his animal allies. That dynamic — along with his full-throated yodel — has always been Tarzan’s trademark, but in this relatively lifeless incarnation, it simply doesn’t register."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,38,The film's action sequences are a jumble of movement and cuts that have no discernible relation to the actual motion of the characters.
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,38,"It all might wash in a Johnny Weissmuller “Tarzan” movie from the 1940s. It no longer suffices today. Filmmakers, it’s time to pack up Greystoke Manor. Tarzan is dead."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,33,"I can respect the intent to craft The Legend of Tarzan as a new chapter for the hero, one which is aware of all the shortcomings of many Tarzan stories that have gone before. And yet the film minimizes its own best ideas and falls back on adventure film tropes, old and new, in a way that undermines its attempt to decontextualize Burroughs’ aging swinger."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,33,"Don’t be fooled by the lack of spandex: The Legend of Tarzan turns the Lord of the Apes into just another superhero, the newest movie about fiction’s greatest wild man memorable only for the dull irony of how housebroken it feels."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,30,"The Legend of Tarzan is too boring to be truly offensive. In spite of some impressive hand and brow acting, Skarsgard’s Tarzan is a frustrating blank and Margot Robbie’s Jane is a simple damsel in distress."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,25,"Tarzan does little to adapt to modern times. Perhaps most punishingly of all for Skarsgard’s “True Blood” fans, it fails to ever put our hero in a skimpy loincloth."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,25,"The Legend of Tarzan doles out big beats of action at regular intervals to keep you awake, like a drunkard clashing trashcan lids in an alley late at night. But your eyelids grow heavy anyway."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,25,"In the end, what we have here is a Tarzan movie made by people who don’t understand the appeal of Tarzan. He’s about joy and abandon and the fantasy of living in harmony with creation. He’s not about the struggle in the Congo."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,20,"This ungainly and glum tale of the man famously known as Tarzan — who returns to the Congo, reconnecting with his past in the process — slavishly adheres to contemporary blockbuster convention, offering not a single spark of inspiration or real daring. A talented cast led by Alexander Skarsgård scowls through the film, held hostage by a solemn script and ghastly amounts of CG."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,10,"The Legend of Tarzan, for all its anticolonialist posturing and eminently attractive co-stars, has a dead soul."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,80,Berg immerses us so completely into the horror of these men’s situation that we are gripped throughout. The fighting is incredibly intense.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,80,"All four performances are first-rate, and the action is staged with shattering intensity."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,80,"Berg, who wrote and directed, is more interested in how men deal with battle than the ideals or the politics that put them there. What the movie achieves, with a gruesome energy and a remarkable reality, is a firefight."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,Most war films try to be epic in scope and intent. Lone Survivor opts for a smaller focus and succeeds on its own terms.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,"The middle 40 minutes of Lone Survivor have to be some of the toughest battle scenes in Hollywood history - an epic, close-range firefight that finds the SEALs throwing themselves down rock faces like superheroes. Only they aren't superheroes - they bleed, they break."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,"Lone Survivor is primarily about the unflinching bravery of SEALs executing their mission and looking out for one another, even as they’re coming to grips with the reality of how this thing is going to end."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,"The surprisingly thoughtful third act both introduces complexity to its portrayal of the Afghan people, and subtly reminds us that, despite Luttrell's astonishing constitution and self-surgery skills, as well as the ultimate sacrifices made by his comrades in arms, it was all for naught."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,"Like the best war movies, Lone Survivor laces action with moral questions that haunt and provoke."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,"Wahlberg remains one of our most reliable and least actorly of movie stars, innately macho but vulnerable enough to seem like a human being caught in an inhuman situation."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,"Conveying a visceral sense of warfare's terror is what Berg chiefly seeks, and on that level Lone Survivor handily succeeds."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,Berg is relentlessly unsparing.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,"Survivor is a pummeling, frenzied ride, one of fall's most charged action films. The gunfights and rocket-propelled grenades are palpable, and Berg manages to make the chaos followable."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,"Together, all four cast members help draw a line across the narrative—separating when we were watching a mildly engaging depiction of names, dates, and locations, and a hellish, immersive situation with no easy outcome in sight."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,70,"Lone Survivor has no politics in the sense that it presents a more or less factual story about Luttrell and his comrades trying to fight their way out against overwhelming odds, and tells the truth that most of them didn’t make it. But the visual symbolism and the iconography of this movie are not apolitical or ideologically neutral at all."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,70,"That people want to see a competent action picture in the depths of winter isn’t all that depressing, but the fact that they’re swallowing the disgusting symbolism of this one definitely is."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,70,"Lone Survivor’s lack of suspense never works against it. If anything, the fact that the outcome is, at least roughly, known in advance only adds to the film’s sickening tension, the atmosphere of preordained doom through which its characters seem to move."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,70,"It is a modest, competent, effective movie, concerned above all with doing the job of explaining how the job was done."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,70,"The film is rugged, skilled, relentless, determined, narrow-minded and focused, everything that a soldier must be when his life is on the line."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,70,"Berg’s blunt, pummeling style offers few nuances and makes no apologies, but his broad brushstrokes have clearly found an ideal canvas in this grimly heroic rendering of hell on earth."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,70,"Ultimately seems at war with itself, torn between its duties as an entertaining, engaging movie and a somber, sincere memorial, and in splitting the difference, the film effectively assaults its audience almost as aggressively as its subjects."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,68,Not much depth or political examination here. The film works best as a survivalist’s manual.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,67,Lone Survivor is a somber celebration of courage and endurance that manages to steer clear of jingoism and moral judgments.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,67,Berg has made a powerful film and an important reminder of what really happens when we send men and women off to war. It's just too bad that subtlety isn't a stronger weapon in his arsenal.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,67,"For all his directorial shortcomings, Berg has a knack for capturing men at work; his depiction of special-ops maneuvering—of silently casing the enemy base, of planning the attack—is as compelling as the chaotic violence he orchestrates later."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,67,This is a contemporary war-is-hell account in which hell burns so intensely that it scorches the firewalls of the mundane world around it. But it doesn’t burn them down.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,63,"The actors are excellent, as are the bruising re-creations of the firefight and the uncountable injuries sustained."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,63,"The characters are only superficially sketched in, but we still fear for them, understand their code and above all else, appreciate the dirty, bloody, high-risk work these professionals do. That they go through all this and risk everything, by choice, is something Berg, to his credit, never lets us forget."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,63,"The direction pummels and the cast impress, yet Berg’s war movie promises more than it delivers. Memories of Battleship are sunk, but that Oscar buzz may be a bit premature."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,60,"Neither an anti-war tract nor a jingoistic rallying cry, the brutal but humane Lone Survivor instead registers as a howl of despair for so many young men and women lost in war."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,60,"A severe portrait of fortitude under extreme pressure, somewhat marred by blinkered politics."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,60,"While Lone Survivor is presented as a piece of hero-focused entertainment, it is a suitably sobering one in the end, and a film that is bound to stick to the ribs of audiences longer than, say, your average Superman movie."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,60,"You may salute Lone Survivor for its desperate intensity; but the film remains pinned down by its military and political dilemma: between gung-ho and F—, no."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,60,"Lone Survivor, from start to finish, is a tale of disaster, of bad luck and bad communication, perhaps even faulty planning, though that's hard to say. So the movie loses the common touch of average folk trying to get by, while also losing some of the pleasure of watching a crack unit at work."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,50,"Lone Survivor burns with the fever of a passion project. Writer-director Peter Berg's gratitude to United States servicemen for all their sacrifice comes through viscerally, from first frame to last."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,50,"Lone Survivor is a grotesque action movie at times impressively directed by Peter Berg that combines the brute masculinity with the ugliness of the battlefield and viscerally unsettling shock value. But it's less a depiction of courage than a brutish magnification of anger and pain, both of which it conveys a lot better than the high ground that it reaches for."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,50,"The simplicity of Lone Survivor eventually becomes a handicap, because after a certain point, the film becomes just one long battle sequence, lacking narrative ebb and flow."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,50,There hasn’t been this bizarre mixture of hooah and death since John Wayne hung up his combat boots.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,50,"Crudely written, rife with clichés, and leaves out anything that would transform a piece of propaganda into a work of art akin to Samuel Fuller’s ""The Steel Helmet,"" Brian DePalma’s ""Casualties of War,"" or Steven Spielberg’s ""Saving Private Ryan."""
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,40,Peter Berg’s ultra-bloody battle film “Lone Survivor” is ultimately more grueling than satisfying. It’s more carnage than cinema.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,40,"Like his prior ""The Kingdom,"" Peter Berg's film pretends to dabble in a frothy moral ambiguity, swiftly betraying its true aims with trigger-happy jingoism."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,38,"What’s missing here is something, or rather, someone, to care about."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,37,"Lone Survivor just reads like a quasi-political exaggeration of a slasher film: the cellphones that don't work, the rescuers just out of reach, the killers chasing our victims through the woods."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,30,"Berg may be adhering to the basic facts, but his movie’s childish machismo is a disgrace to all involved."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,70,"An action figure with a sweet core, Johnson can pump up the humanity of any franchise, whether he’s playing a stepdad who becomes a hero in Journey 2 or, as here, a stud soldier who treats Flint and Jaye like his grown children and shepherds them through peril. Following those younger Joes, the Retaliation audience is encouraged to clamber up on Johnson’s huge soldiers and go along for a pretty cool ride."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,70,It's not enough to call this the rare franchise action movie to bring the goods; it's the even rarer one whose creators seem to understand what the goods even are.
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,70,"So fetishistic about high-powered weapons that it qualifies as an NRA wet dream, G.I. Joe: Retaliation pretty accurately reflects the franchise's comic book and cartoon origins, which is both a good and a bad thing: good if you're a 12- to 15-year-old boy, bad if you're just about anyone else."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,67,It's well-executed technocratic action fluff. But it did leave me buzzed rather than drained.
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,67,"Retaliation is no masterpiece, but it’s a movie whose fun doesn’t feel like a four-letter word -- popcorn entertainment that not only rivals what you see during summer, but surpasses what you see from Sommers."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,63,"A more sure-footed shoot-'em-up that finds some heart, wit and perhaps enough momentum to spawn a formidable action franchise."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,63,Willis is at his relaxed best this time.
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,50,"As long as Hollywood keeps hitting us over the head with empty spectacles like G.I. Joe: Retaliation, regular Joes will be too numb to fight back."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,50,"The directive behind this sequel, clearly, was non-stop action. Let's think about that phrase a second. Do we really want our action movies to deliver action that does not stop? Ever? I get a little tired of action sequences that won't stop."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,50,"Dumb fun can be, well, fun. G.I. Joe: Retaliation is way too much of the former and not nearly enough of the latter."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,50,"At times, G.I. Joe: Retaliation has a sense of its own ridiculousness — Pryce seems to be having a good time, anyway — but not enough to soften the mass death, hardware fetishism, and militaristic zeal that gets in the way of its escapist fun."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,50,"Offering a more straight-faced brand of idiocy than its cheerfully dumb 2009 predecessor, G.I. Joe: Retaliation might well have been titled “G.I. Joe: Regurgitation,” advertising big guns, visual effects and that other line of Hasbro toys with the same joyless, chew-everything-up-and-spit-it-out efficiency."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,50,"Instead of long takes, which are lovingly utilized in Step Up 3D, Jon M. Chu opts for increasing volatility in the editing room."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,50,"It’s a live-action version of on an ’80s cartoon that was designed to sell toys. This is “Transformers” without the Bumblebee Camaro, a lot of action, a few one-liners, and a lot of gunplay."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,40,"If you currently own a G.I. Joe toy or if you've dressed like a ninja at least twice since Halloween, you're going to find a lot to ""hooah"" about in ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation."""
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,40,Plays like a tiresomely extended evening of channel surfing.
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,40,"That G.I. Joe silliness the first film embraced has been steamrolled into tentpole flatness this time around. It’s not stoopid anymore, but just plain stupid."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,40,"The G.I. Joe team is back, and most of their sophomore movie adventure, G.I. Joe Retaliation, is as bland as their name and as subtle as an exploding tank."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,40,"It's massive, all the retaliation and the world saving stuff. And it's convoluted. Frankly no one should have to think that hard to keep up with the Joes."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,40,"Fast Five was a good example of how applying The Rock to a tired series could bring it back to life. G.I. Joe, by opting for self-seriousness instead of knowing daftness, has squandered its secret weapon."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,40,"“Rock solid,” is Bruce Willis’ nod-wink appraisal of an attack strategy in G.I. Joe: Retaliation. The film’s nowhere near as sturdy, trundling out middling action and nonsensical plotting."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,38,"Feels like a five-year-old with a megaphone, excitedly yelling about his latest bulldozer-soldier-dinosaur smash-kill-squash-everything game."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,38,"How funny that Pryce, a tweedy Brit playing a bad guy, should be the one person doing anything remotely heroic for this dud."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,38,"The dialogue and exposition scenes in G.I. Joe are like something out of a Saturday morning cartoon from the 1980s, but the PG-13 violence is a little intense for the 7-year-old boys (and girls) who might love this stuff."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,38,Everything in G.I. Joe: Retaliation is perfunctory - technically proficient but soulless. It's not exciting. It's boring.
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,37,"Although “G.I. Joe” is merely a movie based on Hasbro toys, the action -- the real point of all this -- feels just as lifeless."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,30,"There actually is some clever dialogue in the film, especially early on between Roadblock and Duke (Tatum). But this fades over the course of the film, and too much of what the characters say sounds as though it’s been lifted verbatim from 1930s and 1940s serials."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,30,"The film’s director, Jon M. Chu, executes a pretty good high-altitude fight scene. Still, there should be a “Fans Only” sign at the door of every theater."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,30,I won't pretend that I had a great time watching G.I. Joe: Retaliation.
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,25,"This movie never realizes how ridiculous anything it does truly is, right up to the last-second promise of another sequel."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,25,"What's the difference between an action figure and an action star? Very little in G.I. Joe: Retaliation, which features no performances of note, even from such combat-tested thespians as Bruce Willis, Jonathan Pryce and Dwayne Johnson."
Clear and Present Danger,6.9,122187717,90,The filmmakers haven't simply tamed the rogue elephant of Clancy's narrative; they've turned it into something that moves as gracefully and as powerfully as a gazelle.
Clear and Present Danger,6.9,122187717,90,"Another fast, gripping spy story with some good tricks up its sleeve."
Clear and Present Danger,6.9,122187717,80,Narrative complexity and momentum make this a true cinematic equivalent of an absorbing page-turner.
Clear and Present Danger,6.9,122187717,80,"There is enough intrigue to keep it interesting, and if it ever feels too slow, try counting the number of people who get betrayed."
Clear and Present Danger,6.9,122187717,80,The plot alone is a thing of beauty.
Clear and Present Danger,6.9,122187717,78,"An absorbing, if overlong adaptation of Tom Clancy's bestseller."
Clear and Present Danger,6.9,122187717,75,The storytelling is livelier and more engaging than previous adaptations of Clancy's turgid techno-thrillers.
Clear and Present Danger,6.9,122187717,70,"Enjoyable, but it's a shallow enjoyment."
Clear and Present Danger,6.9,122187717,70,Earlier Clancy films alternated between the dull and the ridiculous. First-rate writers like Steven Zaillian and the great John Milius have managed to make this considerably meatier.
Clear and Present Danger,6.9,122187717,63,"There's nothing ""wrong"" with this movie but it feels like warmed-over business as usual."
Clear and Present Danger,6.9,122187717,60,"As a thriller, this 21 2-hour production takes a slow route between short bursts of excitement."
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,90,The Industrial Light & Magic special visual effects unit does yeoman work in staging the action with cliffhanger intensity.
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,89,This Tom Clancy thriller gets the proper screen treatment here with this first-rate cast and direction by one of the genres best: Die Hard director John McTiernan.
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,88,"A skillful, efficient film that involves us in the clever and deceptive game being played by Ramius and in the best efforts of those on both sides to figure out what he plans to do with his submarine - and how he plans to do it."
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,88,This is a Reagan youth's wet dream of underwater ballistics and East-West conflict.
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,80,"Colorful and exciting, yet unless you're a young moviegoer, nothing in it takes you by complete surprise. (It's less a nail-biter than a chin-stroker.)"
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,80,"A heavy-duty mediocrity, sluggish, unwieldy, and instantly forgettable."
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,80,"The film mechanically uses the crosscutting technique made famous by Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"" without any of its wit or focused energy."
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,75,Director John McTiernan rigorously avoids anything that might conceivably be exciting.
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,75,"The movie finally is never very convincing. Even the special effects aren't great. Mr. Connery, however, wears the movie as if it were a favorite old hat. He makes it look good."
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,50,"A leviathan bore, big, clunky and ponderously overplotted."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,90,A first-rate thriller with grit and intrigue to spare.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,88,"Blisteringly fast, Bourne also has a strong or striking supporting actor around every corner: Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, Julia Stiles and Clive Owen in roles that range from meaty to amazingly small."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,88,"One of those rare thrillers where the cops aren't fools, villains don't turn stupid at crucial moments, and career assassins seldom miss targets."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,83,"Somehow the movie works like a clock. Its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar, but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and, at the same time, is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"The full-throttle approach of director Doug Liman (Swingers, Go) is impressive."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,There isn't a dull or dumb moment in this movie.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,The result is an escapist fantasy that is -- Damon's and Potente's persuasive performances aside -- as weightless and inconsequential as a musical. And at the moment every bit as welcome.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"The movie is a generic paranoid espionage fantasy, but its proportions are refreshingly correct. It moves quickly, adroitly, and without fuss."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"This is an entertainment that really entertains because any number of interesting and unexpected choices were made, starting with the selection of Doug Liman as the director."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"Entertaining, handsome and gripping, The Bourne Identity is something of an anomaly among big-budget summer blockbusters: a thriller with some brains and feeling behind it, more attuned to story and character than to spectacle."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"The Bourne Identity, like its hero, triumphs through sheer unreflective professionalism. It is, by today's standards, a modest thriller, with a self-contained storyline and with very few big special effects."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"Like its protagonist, it never hands you explanations on a silver platter, and it makes you think a bit, something far too few thrillers do these days."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"Liman packs enough firepower into The Bourne Identity to please the summer action fan, including a reshot climax that contains one of the niftier stunts I've seen recently. The centerpiece action sequence is a bravura car chase through Paris, yet the moments that bookend it are equally impressive."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"The result is not only entertaining but also refreshing, a shameless crowd-pleaser with a healthy cynicism about itself."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,78,"A skillful action movie about a plot that exists only to support a skillful action movie. The entire story is a set-up for the martial arts and chases. Because they are done well, because the movie is well-crafted and acted, we give it a pass. Too bad it's not about something."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"Nicely paced and fits the bill for those in search of two hours of spy-based action and martial arts. The movie has credibility issues, but none are insurmountable in the name of entertainment."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"Damon, starring in his first full-fledged action pic, brings a determined bearing and believability to the proceedings."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"Though it's clearly meant to be character-driven, the movie is thrown out of whack by a total lack of chemistry between the leads, and some great acting (Clive Owen, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox) on the side."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"Director Doug Liman -- the hip skipper of ""Swingers"" and ""Go"" -- makes all the familiar dirty business seem fun and almost human. In these dog days, Bourne earns what passes as high praise: It doesn't suck."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"A lean, deftly shot, well-acted, weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s European-set spy pictures. There are even moments when you hope it could turn into a modern ""Charade."""
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"The problems with Damon's character are the problem with the movie: It's about plot mechanics, not heart and soul."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,This savvy adaptation of Robert Ludlum's action-clogged 1980 bestseller benefits from the fact that the filmmakers were smart enough to throw out most of the book's preposterous spills and thrills and concentrate instead on its intriguing central character.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,70,"May be a bloodless piece of thriller craftsmanship, but at a time when craft has become negligible, its efficiency and whipcrack timing are increasingly uncommon virtues."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,70,"As for Damon, this may not be a performance so much as an appearance. But he cares so utterly, it works."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,63,"Makes one interested in seeing the inevitable sequel, but one is also left to somewhat question the worth of sitting through this first installment."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,63,"It has a few whispers of intrigue, but at the heart of The Bourne Identity lies a dispiriting paradox: The more that Jason Bourne learns about himself, the less arresting he seems."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,60,"Films borrow tricks from pictures made years ago -- try to watch Bourne without thinking of ""The Manchurian Candidate."""
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,60,"Next time Damon will have to find a worthier vehicle. As the intended start of a franchise, The Bourne Identity is a bit of a bust."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,60,All this is diverting but also borderline dull.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,60,Banal big-budget adaptation of Robert Ludlum's 1980 espionage thriller.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,58,"The best audiences can hope for is that they, too, get amnesia and forget they ever saw this movie."
Speed,7.2,121248145,100,"We've seen this done before, but seldom so well, or at such a high pitch of energy."
Speed,7.2,121248145,100,"The film takes off from formula elements-it's yet another variation on ""Die Hard""-but it manipulates those elements so skillfully, with such a canny mixture of delirium and restraint, that I walked out of the picture with the rare sensation that every gaudy thrill had been earned."
Speed,7.2,121248145,100,"The result is clean, delirious, and, yes, speedy—the best big-vehicle-in-peril movie since Clouzot's ""The Wages of Fear."""
Speed,7.2,121248145,90,"The movie has two virtues essential to good pop thrillers. First, it plugs uncomplicatedly into lurking anxieties -- in this case the ones we brush aside when we daily surrender ourselves to mass transit in a world where the loonies are everywhere. Second, it is executed with panache and utter conviction."
Speed,7.2,121248145,90,It's an ingenious premise that first-time director Jan De Bont has turned into a tremendously well-executed motion picture.
Speed,7.2,121248145,88,"If you're looking for action movie heaven, try Speed, a crackling blend of suspense and fun that gives you the rush of a runaway roller coaster."
Speed,7.2,121248145,88,"Acclaimed cinematographer Jan De Bont's directing debut is a mindless, implausible, and thoroughly gripping adventure movie."
Speed,7.2,121248145,88,"This film's dialogue isn't much more literate than a bus schedule, but its plotting is smart and breathless enough to make up for that."
Speed,7.2,121248145,80,There are very few action movies that cut to the chase quite as quickly as Speed and then have the stamina to keep it up for nearly two hours.
Speed,7.2,121248145,80,"First-time helmer Jan De Bont, the ace lenser of most of Paul Verhoeven's films as well as ""Die Hard"" and numerous other large-scale pix, handles the action with great nimbleness and dexterity; film can hardly be faulted for its visual presentation of very complex action."
Speed,7.2,121248145,80,"De Bont knows how to edit a pulse-pounding sequence, he knows how to keep the screen white-hot, and he sure knows how to blow things up real good. What he doesn't know is how to slow down - this premise is perfect for him."
Speed,7.2,121248145,75,"The deft arabesques of cinematographer Andrzej Bartkowiak juice up the suspense, and if you're not too put off by the sheer ridiculousness of the story you won't be bored."
Speed,7.2,121248145,70,"In a film like this, timing is everything, and everyone from the stunt coordinators to the crew-at-large seems to have gotten it right the first time."
Speed,7.2,121248145,67,"Undeniably, the picture now and again supplies that edge-of-the-seat sensation; yet, by action-adventure standards, Speed is leaden and strangely poky. It never seems to shift into overdrive and let fly."
Speed,7.2,121248145,63,"The plot becomes so overextended, as Reeves and Hopper wage their endless public transportation battle, even the hardest Die-Harders will consider leaping off way before the final stop."
G-Force,5.1,119436770,63,"A pleasant, inoffensive 3-D animated farce about a team of superspy gophers."
G-Force,5.1,119436770,63,"Thanks to an unexpected twist and a clever motivation lurking in the back story of the super-villain, G-Force has enough going on to more or less maintain grown-up interest, and there's plenty to please the kiddies."
G-Force,5.1,119436770,60,"Amping up the ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" formula with a whole A-team of adorable, talking furballs who converse in one-liners and pop culture references (Apocalypse Now and Scarface, really?), the mega-producer’s stamp is on every fight sequence, explosion and ugly stereotype."
G-Force,5.1,119436770,50,"Just about the only folks likely to find this humdrum hybrid of ""Mission: Impossible"" and ""The Wind in the Willows"" worthy for consideration are non-discriminating pip-squeaks."
G-Force,5.1,119436770,50,There's seldom a dull moment -- but nor are there any that allow viewers young or old to invest in its elite team of furry characters to any satisfying or lasting degree despite the presence of an energetic voice cast.
G-Force,5.1,119436770,50,"Toward the end, G-Force starts making no sense at all, neither tonally or narratively. It may not matter to the target audience, though the look on my son's face when it was over was pure Buster Keaton. He says he liked it well enough. Me, a little less."
G-Force,5.1,119436770,50,"A fur-covered ""A-Team"" for the kiddies, G-Force is heavy on splashy pyrotechnics and predictably light on plot."
G-Force,5.1,119436770,50,It's not so much a bad movie as it is a pointless one.
G-Force,5.1,119436770,50,"G-Force is unlikely to keep anyone older than 10 on the edge of his seat, and the bathroom humor may annoy adults. But the message of unity, while unoriginal, is consistently sweet."
G-Force,5.1,119436770,50,It's an action-comedy. It's in 3-D. There's a video-game tie-in. Throw in a fluorescent Slushie from the candy counter and your eight-year-old will be in heaven.
G-Force,5.1,119436770,50,"Manages to be fairly entertaining in that exhausting, rackety, late-summer-kiddie-movie way."
G-Force,5.1,119436770,50,Your ability to enjoy G-Force will correlate directly with how funny you find the idea of guinea pigs as action heroes.
G-Force,5.1,119436770,50,"The first 3-D film produced by Jerry Bruckheimer turns out to be similar to 2-D projects from the same noise-making producer--heavy on action scenes and heavy, too, on message."
G-Force,5.1,119436770,42,"Pointing out G-Force’s plot holes would be redundant; it’s more hole than plot, and more videogame commercial and exhausted-old-trope clearinghouse than film."
G-Force,5.1,119436770,40,"What it is, really, is a trainer film, meant to prep the world's youngest ticketholders for the day when they're old enough to help turn Bruckheimer's bigger movies into blockbusters."
G-Force,5.1,119436770,38,The general consensus on this one: Rats.
G-Force,5.1,119436770,30,An aggressively stupid entry in the family-adventure genre from Jerry Bruckheimer.
G-Force,5.1,119436770,25,"A lot of resources went into making G-Force - a lot of talent, a lot of money, a lot of marketing - and there's not much to show for it, not even some halfway imaginative 3-D gimmickry."
G-Force,5.1,119436770,11,Vacant and pointless.
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,88,One of the most complex and visually interesting science fiction movies in a long time.
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,83,"Starts out as mind-bending futuristic satire and then turns relentless -- it becomes a violent, postpunk version of an Indiana Jones cliff-hanger."
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,80,"A worthy entry in the dystopian cycle of SF movies launched by ""Blade Runner"" (including ""The Terminator"" and ""Robocop""), this seems less derivative than most of its predecessors yet equally accomplished in its straight-ahead storytelling, with plenty of provocative satiric undertones and scenic details."
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,80,"The fierce and unrelenting pace, accompanied by a tongue-in-cheek strain of humor in the roughhouse screenplay, keeps the film moving like a juggernaut."
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,80,Top-flight muscleman entertainment that is not afraid to have a brain or two in its head.
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,80,"An ""intelligent"" action film, because it presents the viewer with an opportunity to puzzle things out rather than sit mindlessly and watch people get blown to pieces."
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,80,Mr. Verhoeven is much better at drumming up this sort of artificial excitement than he is at knowing when to stop.
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,75,"Actually, any fun you might encounter in Recall can be traced, most often, to director Verhoeven, who injects some of his ""Robocop"" camp into this mega-dumb project."
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,75,"Ugly, stupid, loud, offensive, and pointlessly violent--let's not mince words--this film should be called ""Total Reject."""
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,63,Guilty of gross mellerdrammer & innocent of sophistication... Guilty of being dumber than WWF wrestling & innocent of hypocrisy about its cartoon violence.
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,63,"The overall effect is like wading through hospital waste. Verhoeven, who also directed the maliciously stylistic ""Robocop,"" disappoints with this appalling onslaught of blood and boredom."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,91,It's a comedy of manhood for the age of emasculation.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,88,The funniest movie of the year.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,83,"The Other Guys finds McKay back to trying something wildly ambitious with his comedy, and largely succeeding."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,83,"Great casting takes The Other Guys most of the way: Ferrell draws a wealth of good material from his character's oddball ineffectuality, and he partners perfectly with Wahlberg, who's always best at his most incredulous."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,83,This summer's funniest movie.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,80,The Other Guys isn't easy to peg. It's not a comedy that loosens you up and mellows you out; it works by needling you progressively into a state of anxiety.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,80,Nimbly blending comedy and action -- with an affectionate slo-mo nod to John Woo -- McKay does his best work to date here.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,75,"The film's first 15 minutes are by far the most fun (and could be the best quarter-hour of any movie released this year), with Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock letting it all hang out."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,75,So hilarious that even longtime Ferrell haters (me) can't resist it.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,75,"At its core, a perceptive satire of the interpersonal boiling points in buddy-cop pictures."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,75,"Ferrell is effortlessly uproarious. And watching hardass Wahlberg, in his first starring shot at farce, shake his sillies out is not to be missed."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,70,"Here the filmmakers are in fine fettle, which goes a long way to make much of the low-brow silliness and slapstick infectious."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,70,"A surprising, laugh-out-loud take on the old buddy-cop genre. It's sneaky and smartly funny, offering an almost perfect balance of action and comedy.  That's the good news. Then there's the matter of the movie's disheartening final 25 minutes."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,70,"It's loud, raunchy, semicoherent and stuffed to the bursting point with heavy weaponry and car chases, most of which involve a red, cocaine-covered Prius that's been pressed into service as a police car. But Adam McKay's comedy of chaos, which he wrote with Chris Henchy, can also be very funny."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,70,Michael Keaton is a stitch as an emasculated police captain moonlighting as a retail store manager.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,70,"It's a mixed bag with plenty of gags that fall flat, not a comic masterpiece. But it's got tremendous zing, a sense of mischief and a big heart, more than enough to mark it as a delicious shot of caffeinated ice cream, and the summer season's funniest comedy."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,70,"Like some silly summer song that can't be shaken from the mind, this is a catchy enterprise, no better than it tries to be and no less funny."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,63,"Like a padded ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch. What would have been very funny for 15 minutes, and pretty funny for 45, doesn't maintain the standard over the course of a feature-length film."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,63,"For a good hour, this is the picture Kevin Smith was trying to make with ""Cop Out."""
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,63,"It's amusingly off-the-wall, but entirely too cluttered to come together."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,63,"As with most Ferrell projects, there's nothing profound going on in The Other Guys. It's just a bit of good, stupid fun, had at the expense of an uber-formulaic genre that has long been ripe for the spoofing. But it also works."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,63,"For the most part, The Other Guys is seriously silly stuff, in the best sense."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,60,"Skewers the action genre while also finding room for sheer madness. We've still yet to see the equal of Ron Burgundy, but this latest offering is a wonky yet worthy addition to the McKay/Ferrell pantheon."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,60,"The film, meanwhile, gives Wahlberg and Ferrell beautiful opportunities to turn their anger-mismanagement-meets-milquetoast act into an absurdist version of Abbott and Costello."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,60,It's dumb and consistently funny.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,60,Wahlberg is surprisingly committed to the ridiculousness.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,"Opens strongly and front-loads its best gags into the first third of the film. After that, the jokes begin to repeat themselves, and the plot becomes mired in unintelligible details of the white-collar crime."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,A typical vehicle for Ferrell's atypical humor.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,Have you ever seen a movie you half-liked a lot?
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,The Other Guys actually suffers by comparison to its own madcap opening sequence.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,"Raises expectations that it has no real inclination to fulfill. The movie's best bits would stand alone nicely on YouTube, or on Funnyordie.com, the comic video boutique of which Mr. McKay is an owner and where he sometimes dabbles in short-form hilarity."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,"Starts out as a hilarious take on cop-movie cliches, then turns into Will Ferrell's own ""Capitalism: A Love Story."""
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,The laughs ultimately take a backseat to a convoluted white-collar crime story.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,"There's a fine line between stupid comedy that's actually pretty smart and stupid comedy that's just dumb, and The Other Guys crosses the line - into realms of unredeeming dunderheadedness - more often than it should."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,"Following the clues, The Other Guys turns more hectic than antic, and somebody didn't pack enough comedy for this long trip."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,88,"Director Phil Alden Robinson and his writers, Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne, do a spellbinding job of cranking up the tension, they create a portrait of convincing realism, and then they add the other stuff because, well, if anybody ever makes a movie like this without the obligatory Hollywood softeners, audiences might flee the theater in despair."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,80,"Director Phil Alden Robinson -- has done just about everything he can do to build a sleek, involving and -- for a few minutes -- terrifying movie that can get viewers past the young Ryan factor."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,80,"Smartly directed, grown-up film of ideas -- with a debonair script by Paul Attanasio (Donny Brasco) and Daniel Pyne."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,75,"All told, it's a reasonably effective movie, but it might have been a lot more effective had it the guts to portray a Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden-like character as its villain instead of this rather unbelievable, but more politically correct, gaggle of cardboard neo-Nazis."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,75,A middlebrow hybrid that should satisfy most fans of spy movies without blowing them away.
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,75,"The movie does what all good thrillers should do -- provide enough shocks and surprises to keep us guessing, and never lets up on the suspense until the end credits arrive."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,75,"Impossible to watch passively. It may be a work of pure fiction, with the requisite preposterous plot turns, but it still has the air of a ''what if?'' scenario, and it is perfectly, thoroughly chilling."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,70,Screenwriters Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne stick to Clancy's sure-fire formula -- building tension from the political infighting behind a worsening crisis.
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,70,"Has vast scope, unflagging energy, a rousing Jerry Goldsmith score and a horrendous disaster sequence that conveys much in discreet fashion in keeping with post-Sept. 11 sensibilities yet is needlessly evasive in telling us the precise extent of its magnitude."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,70,"Smart, complex, and engrossing idea-driven action thriller."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,67,"The tension is so plausibly high that you're eager to see how it winds up. Eager enough, in fact, to forgive Jack Ryan for reversing the aging process and winding up as Ben Affleck."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,67,"A world-detonation thriller, at once urgent and lazy, that benefits from its connection to current events and also, by the end, suffers from it."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,63,The sum of all snores until the moviemakers start blowing up Baltimore halfway through. Then the special-effects people take over for about 20 breathless minutes.
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,60,"At once too real for escapism and too ridiculous for a credible espionage thriller, The Sum Of All Fears unfolds like a cruel joke and treats imagined human tragedy as the punchline."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,"Fortunately, even when star and story are ineffectual, Fears' supporting players are all thrilling, especially Morgan Freeman."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,"Mediocre terrorist melodrama turned even punier by real-life events, and that's before we scratch our heads at its lead-actor choice."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,"Yet there's no getting around one awkward fact. The picture, which turns on a cataclysmic act of terrorism within U.S. borders, was made for a different audience from the one that's about to see it."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,"How's this for frightening: The casting of the lightweight Ben Affleck as a CIA agent who holds the fate of the entire world in his pretty-boy hands. Can't deny it, that got my heart pumping like a bunny."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,"And then there's Liev Schreiber as CIA operative John Clark. With less than 30 minutes of screen time, he's everything Affleck isn't - magnetic, clever, and delightful to watch. If only the filmmakers had possessed the courage to cast the splendid Schreiber instead of the feeble Affleck."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,"Should carry all the urgency of a film that captures, magnifies and elaborates on the anxieties of its time. Luckily, that movie has already been made: It's called ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and it's available at a video store near you."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,"It's a striking measure of the nervousness of the country right now that a movie so full of holes should be as gripping as it is, at least for its first two-thirds, after which it collapses into a swamp of sentimental mush."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,"Feels awfully rushed, as Ryan flies from the Ukraine to Moscow to the Russian hinterlands and back to Baltimore to make sweet, sophomore agent love to his physician girlfriend (Moynahan). It has the feel of one of 007's globe-hopping adventures, but without any of that franchise's giddy sense of fun."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,Film's real sticky wicket is that the bad guys not only threaten to nuke a major American city but do it — a conceit that might have been more amusing before terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center using hijacked commercial jets. Witnesses said the WTC attack looked like a movie; they didn't say it was a movie they wanted to see.
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,40,"As a spy film, The Sum of All Fears is flaccid, and as an expose of nuclear threats, there's not enough information."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,40,"Surprisingly uninvolving, the least effective of Neufeld's Clancy-based movies. Surely he was not looking for this kind of film: one that bombs literally and figuratively."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,40,"Movie has been upstaged by the sum of our fears. The staunch heroics, frantic presidential huddles, and hairbreadth rescues all seem tinny and escapist, too Cold Warrior–ish, for what's really going on now."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,40,"Isn't a serious attempt to deal with our vulnerability to terrorism, or to address how established channels of power can bring us to the brink. It's the same damn Tom Clancy picture that's been churned out since ""The Hunt for Red October,"" as humorless and gray and dour as its predecessors."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,38,"A moribund attempt to exhume the Jack Ryan techno-thriller franchise with a severely miscast Ben Affleck, is truly the 20-megaton bomb among this summer's blockbusters."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,30,"How the hell did Ben Affleck, 29, wind up replacing Harrison Ford, 59, as our hero? Who's next as Ryan -- Ozzy Osbourne's guppy son, Jack? Chronology hasn't been this royally fucked with since Memento."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,30,The jerry-rigged result is a trite espionage thriller without the thrills but with a lingering measure of nausea.
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,75,"When all's said and done, it turns out to be quite sweet-natured.  OK. I laughed. So sue me."
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,75,Lawrence plus latex equals laughs.
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,63,My guess is that the film will appeal equally to broad-minded 10-year-olds and their grandparents.
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,63,"If you're not rolling in the aisles, you're definitely in the wrong theater."
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,63,"Any movie that employs an oven mitt and a plumber's friend in a childbirth scene cannot be all bad, and I laughed a lot."
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,63,The formulaic screenplay has enough funny moments to keep the audience from concentrating on the predictability of it all.
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,63,"Lawrence -- with the help of Oscar-winning makeup effects artist Greg Cannom (""Mrs. Doubtfire"") -- has created yet another prosthetic screen wonder."
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,60,"Big Momma's got game, but she doesn't have much else."
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,50,Neither good nor terrible.
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,50,"A bad, bad movie...It's loud and dumb and it wastes a good cast on a ludicrous script."
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,50,Lawrence is so ON that he appears to be gunning for clockwork bursts of audience approval.
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,50,Fitfully amusing.
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,50,"The sight and sound of Lawrence in fat-lady drag remains engaging throughout; script may often let him down, forcing him to keep things afloat almost single-handedly."
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,40,"Martin Lawrence, no Eddie Murphy, takes a reheated cross-dressing shtick and turns it into something to elate your inner fourth-grader."
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,38,"If Big Momma's House isn't as bad as you imagined, then you've no imagination at all."
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,38,"Yo momma so fat, when she gets in an elevator, it has to go down. Had enough?"
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,33,"Ends up waddling its way toward gentler, mistier climes, stopping just shy of ""Doubtfire"" country. It doesn't run out of smelly steam so much as downshift and become a different movie."
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,30,This is pretty much a lazy film with a few lighthearted moments and no substance.
Big Momma's House,5.1,117559438,30,So you'll laugh during Big Momma's House -- but the laughs are so negligible you'll probably forget them before you get to the parking lot.
Die Hard 2,7.1,117540947,100,"Because Die Hard 2 is so skillfully constructed and well-directed, it develops a momentum that carries it past several credibility gaps that might have capsized a lesser film."
Die Hard 2,7.1,117540947,100,"It's not as crisply directed, and the plot holes are easier to find, but Die Hard 2 is filled with the same sense of good-natured, wisecracking fun that infused the original."
Die Hard 2,7.1,117540947,88,"It's rambunctiously entertaining, a loop-de-loopy bumper car ride through a firecracker sky, all bright lights, sonic booms and impossible heroics."
Die Hard 2,7.1,117540947,88,"It will surprise no one who saw the first ''Die Hard'' that the heart and soul of the new film is Bruce Willis, who this time is even better."
Die Hard 2,7.1,117540947,88,Die Hard 2 lacks the inventivenes of the original but compensates with relentless action.
Die Hard 2,7.1,117540947,80,"This is the most cheerfully preposterous film of a jaw-dropping summer, which is not to say it's not fun, it's simply orchestrated Looney Tunes."
Die Hard 2,7.1,117540947,80,"A number of scenes have been staged with satisfying kinetic flair, and Willis once again makes an appealing superhero. Yet without that great big booby-trapped skyscraper to hold the action together, the suspense dissipates."
Die Hard 2,7.1,117540947,75,"More violent, more explosive and even bigger than the original - this ticks all the sequel boxes. But as long as Willis is in his vest and playing McClane, it's hard to care about its shortcomings."
Die Hard 2,7.1,117540947,70,"If your idea of a good time is watching a lot of stupid, unpleasant people insult and brutalize one another, this is right up your alley."
Die Hard 2,7.1,117540947,70,Whatever small pleasure there is to be found in this loud dud is due mostly to the residual good feelings from the first film.
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,80,One of those guilty pleasures of the summer. Its also one of those action movies that could have been ruined if Jerry Bruckheimer had taken charge of it.
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,80,"As the team leader, Jackson finds exactly the right tone for the role: a sort of playful cockiness that comes from knowing just how good he is. He's clearly having fun, but he never winks at the audience too much or allows his performance to devolve into camp."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,75,"Directed by Clark Johnson in an efficient and occasionally exhilarating style that points to the Emmy-winner's TV cop-show pedigree (""Homicide,"" ""The Wire,"" ""NYPD Blue"")."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,75,"One of the best cop thrillers since ""Training Day."""
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,75,Aware of its own cuteness because the dialogue plays by the rules of meta-entertainment.
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,70,"While the movie is stupid, it is -- hooray, and let's put this in all the national ads! -- not appallingly stupid."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,70,"Offers up the kind of pleasures that only a summer movie can...The cast is good-looking, the soundtrack is loud, the plot is stupid."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,63,"The standout in the cast is James Todd Smith, whose acting talent may soon persuade him to shed his adolescent stage name of LL Cool J and concentrate on mainstream film roles."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,63,"The strongest parts of the film aren't these money shots, but the buildup to the gunplay."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,60,A thoroughly unremarkable police action movie starring the magnetic Samuel L. Jackson.
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,60,"As summer shoot-'em-ups go, this is pretty well executed, with plenty of macho posing and gunfire."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,60,"Formula is now the name of the game, although a steady diet of stunts and shootouts ensures that the audience is never bored."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,50,"It's just one more competent but routine, midlevel ($70 million) late-summer action movie filled with the usual explosions, shootouts and male bonding."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,50,"There is something sneakily gratifying about all this: Not since the days of ""Earthquake"" have Hollywood producers so indulged their fantasies of trashing the town."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,50,"Those who love police overkill, guns, jingoistic race-baiting, guns, macho smugness, and guns will be well served."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,50,"Serviceable, wholly uninspired."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,50,"I was all revved up to have a whale of a fascist good time, and S.W.A.T. left me let down and pissed-off."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,50,"By the time you've given up guessing whether S.W.A.T. wants to be a half-serious action pic or just affably jokey, its storytelling has turned so ludicrously melodramatic that it doesn't matter."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,50,"Though the film's second half has some good action moments, it never fulfills the promise of its earliest scenes."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,50,"Coming in the wake of the physically astonishing ""Bad Boys 2,"" S.W.A.T. seems square."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,50,"Likely won't please fans of the original TV series, but the movie hasn't been made for them."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,50,"What we have here is a model for the paint-by-numbers, perfectly generic, proudly soulless summer action flick. An original idea would die for lack of oxygen in S.W.A.T."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,50,"S.W.A.T. boasts the kernel of a good idea - but it gets buried in the chaff of half-baked plot threads, partly realized characters and unstructured pandemonium."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,50,"Noisy, standard-issue cop actioner."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,50,"Actor-turned-director Clark Johnson uses the flashy, up-to-the-minute editing and camera stunts action fans expect, but keeps the mayhem on a recognizably human scale  it's big, but not insanely overblown."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,40,Mostly standard-issue muddle.
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,38,"S.W.A.T. may be an acronym for Special Weapons and Tactics, but by the end of this routine melodrama, it might as well stand for Standard Whacking and Trashing."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,38,Technically clever but emotionally bankrupt...it's an almost laughably opportunistic movie.
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,38,"A compendium of missed opportunities, uninspired action and clichés so tired, you wish the screenwriters had called 911, too."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,38,"Lots of buildings and cars explode, but there isn't a spark between any of the characters."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,30,"Surely something more original than this could have been mined from the history of North Americas largest and most professional police force. As it is, though, Johnsons film is just firing blanks."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,25,"SWAT is better than ""Gigli,"" but so is most outpatient surgery."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,20,"Seems best suited to all the couch-potato swinging dicks who get off watching the police on ""Cops"" keep the public safe from people in possession of marijuana."
S.W.A.T.,6,116934650,10,"A prototypical new-millennium summer movie, S.W.A.T. is no more than an extended trailer for itself."
The Towering Inferno,6.9,116000000,90,"The Towering Inferno is one of the greatest disaster pictures made, a personal and professional triumph for producer Irwin Allen."
The Towering Inferno,6.9,116000000,83,"The fun of watching The Towering Inferno is in figuring out which old star Allen is going to indiscriminately kill off, as well as watching ultramodern décor go up in flames while a bunch of stubborn egotists refuse to listen to reasonable men."
The Towering Inferno,6.9,116000000,80,"Much more than a way to pass a rainy bank holiday afternoon, this is rocking good superleague disaster adventure."
The Towering Inferno,6.9,116000000,75,By far the best of the mid-1970s wave of disaster films.
The Towering Inferno,6.9,116000000,75,In nearly every reasonable sense it’s the far more accomplished of the two famed Allen disaster epics.
The Towering Inferno,6.9,116000000,75,"Everything a disaster movie should be, a combination of soap opera and the spectacle of destruction."
The Towering Inferno,6.9,116000000,75,"The story is stock, but thanks to the behind-the-scene fire wranglers, you can practically feel the heat."
The Towering Inferno,6.9,116000000,70,"Movies like The Towering Inferno appear to have been less directed than physically constructed. This one is overwrought and silly in its personal drama, but the visual spectacle is first rate. You may not come out of the theater with any important ideas about American architecture or enterprise, but you will have had a vivid, completely safe nightmare."
The Towering Inferno,6.9,116000000,70,This is the disaster film which set the style for the genre in the decade to come.
The Towering Inferno,6.9,116000000,50,"As the bland, star-laden drama gets swallowed by fiery special-effects setpieces, it feels like one type of big-budget mediocrity giving way to the next."
The Towering Inferno,6.9,116000000,50,The movie doesn’t stick together in one’s head; this thing is like some junky fairground show—a chamber of horrors with skeletons that jump up.
District 9,7.9,115646235,100,"Every now and then, a film comes along that both defies and compels description. District 9 is one such movie: a science-fiction action vehicle so brilliantly and fully imagined that real life, when it resumes after the credits, arrives with a new sense of dread."
District 9,7.9,115646235,100,"A sci-fi-fueled indictment of man's inhumanity to man -- and the non-human -- District 9 is all horribly familiar, and transfixing."
District 9,7.9,115646235,100,"To his credit, however, the often-playful Blomkamp never bludgeons his audience with any specific message. He's too busy letting 'er rip with his edge-of-your-seat, and unapologetically violent, sci-fi adventure."
District 9,7.9,115646235,100,"No true fan of science fiction -- or, for that matter, cinema -- can help but thrill to the action, high stakes and suspense built around a very original chase movie."
District 9,7.9,115646235,100,"The humanity of District 9 adds another dimension to this multilayered, rewarding work -- one of the best of the summer, and undoubtedly the most inventive from the multiplex this year."
District 9,7.9,115646235,100,"Madly original, cheekily political, altogether exciting District 9."
District 9,7.9,115646235,100,"District 9 is very smart sci-fi, but that's just the beginning; it's also a scathing social satire hidden inside a terrific action thriller teeming with gross aliens and regrettable inter-species conflict. And it's a blast. . . ."
District 9,7.9,115646235,100,"District 9 proves that genre films, besides being a hell of a lot of fun, can say things you hadn't considered and show stuff you haven't seen."
District 9,7.9,115646235,91,"This is a delicious premise, and Blomkamp, who first played with it in a 2005 short called ""Alive in Joburg,"" has magnified and improved it with ferocious energy, wit and style."
District 9,7.9,115646235,90,Grabs you by the eyeballs from the very first frame.
District 9,7.9,115646235,90,"Though compelling throughout, District 9 never becomes outright terrifying, largely because Blomkamp is less interested in exploiting his aliens for cheap scares than in holding up a mirror to our own bloodthirsty, xenophobic species."
District 9,7.9,115646235,90,"District 9 whizzes by with a resourcefulness and mordant wit nearly worthy of its obvious influences: ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and ""Starship Troopers."""
District 9,7.9,115646235,89,"Blomkamp and his entire cast and crew have created an instant genre classic that transcends the self-limiting ghetto implied by the term ""science fiction"" and instead, like precursors such as Robert Wise's ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" engages not only the mind but the heart as well. It's magnificent."
District 9,7.9,115646235,88,"A great-looking and smart film. It has enough action, wonder, depth, and action to keep any fan of the genre happy. The sociological undertones here are fascinating as well."
District 9,7.9,115646235,88,The reason District 9 reverberates so loudly is because its moral indignation is cranked to 11.
District 9,7.9,115646235,88,"Anyone who watches District 9 and doesn't think of Apartheid, Nazis, and Josef Mengele needs to spend some time reading a few history books."
District 9,7.9,115646235,88,"South African director Neill Blomkamp set and shot the film around his native Johannesburg, so parallels to apartheid leap to mind. Yet the script he wrote with Terri Tatchell applies to any culture that bluntly excludes another."
District 9,7.9,115646235,88,Attention all geeks (and geeks at heart): Get ready for two hours of serious awesome.
District 9,7.9,115646235,88,This baby has the stuff to end the movie summer on a note of dazzle and distinction.
District 9,7.9,115646235,88,"With its clever faux documentary style, this is the most imaginative science-fiction movie to come along in years."
District 9,7.9,115646235,83,"The ad campaign for the sci-fi thriller District 9, with mysterious billboards touting aliens among us, is highly creative and amusing. So, in patches, is the movie, which is a thinking man's, or man-boy's, ""Transformers."""
District 9,7.9,115646235,83,"District 9 fuses science fiction mayhem and biting social commentary as well as any film since ""Starship Troopers."" It’s the rare alien invasion story that has the aliens running scared."
District 9,7.9,115646235,80,"A memorable, monstrous fable that's consistently gripping."
District 9,7.9,115646235,80,Blomkamp’s prawn cocktail has more than enough stylistic chutzpah and originality to make District 9 an essential date.
District 9,7.9,115646235,80,"In the best B-movie tradition, the filmmakers embed their ideas in an ingenious, propulsive and suspenseful genre entertainment, one that respects your intelligence even as it makes your eyes pop (and, once in a while, your stomach turn)."
District 9,7.9,115646235,75,"Despite its creativity, the movie remains space opera and avoids the higher realms of science-fiction."
District 9,7.9,115646235,75,"The last time I felt the sort of outrageously kinetic action-movie high District 9 delivers, it was 1981 and George Miller, Mel Gibson, and ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" had just come roaring out of Australia."
District 9,7.9,115646235,75,"Some movies pack such a terrific central idea, even their flaws can’t stop the train. District 9 is one of them."
District 9,7.9,115646235,70,"There is a lot of shield-your-eyes ickiness in District 9, a lot of violence and gore. What there is not a lot of, however, is humanity - even in the film's depiction of the inhumanity humans are capable of."
District 9,7.9,115646235,63,"As an allegory of racial conflict and mass immigration, District 9 never really goes anywhere: The appealing premise fades into the background before 20 minutes have elapsed."
District 9,7.9,115646235,50,"Unfortunately, as in many such big-screen comic books, the backstory beats the hell out of the present-tense plot."
District 9,7.9,115646235,50,"The movie falls into the same uneasy category as ""Eight Legged Freaks"": too tongue-in-cheek to be thrilling, not funny enough to be a comedy."
District 9,7.9,115646235,50,"It's a bad joke that District 9 will be hailed for its ""originality."""
District 9,7.9,115646235,50,"Yes, the premise is delightful; no, the delight doesn't last."
District 9,7.9,115646235,50,"There's a wonderfully sly, farcical verve to these early moments, but it dissipates when the script, with its strains of ""E.T."" and ""The Fly,"" moves into high sci-fi gear."
The Karate Kid Part II,6,115103979,75,"Kid II is an enlightening experience. It teaches you a little about courage, mercy, and the zen of movie-cycle maintenance."
The Karate Kid Part II,6,115103979,70,"The plotline is classic Western morality-play stuff, with the goodies and baddies clearly delineated, but the set pieces are well constructed, and the whole thing is beautifully staged and shot."
The Karate Kid Part II,6,115103979,63,"There are scattered pleasures throughout the film due to its two lead performances, which are the equal of the work done in the original. It's just that with a few exceptions, the characters Miyagi and Daniel are forced into conflict with aren't worthy of their time."
The Karate Kid Part II,6,115103979,60,"Even as sequels go in this era of movie mega-series, The Karate Kid Part II peters out faster than most."
The Karate Kid Part II,6,115103979,50,"Macchio, for his part, is an obviously intelligent actor with terrific instincts. Still, this movie leaves a bit to be desired: much of the movie seems recycled, and there is precious little subtlety in the villains' characterizations. The film is also about 15 minutes too long, with far too many convenient plot devices."
The Karate Kid Part II,6,115103979,50,"Script delivers any number of wise old Eastern homilies. Anyone over the age of 18 is liable to start fidgeting when Macchio dominates the action, but then viewers beyond that advanced age are irrelevant with this film."
The Karate Kid Part II,6,115103979,50,"Karate Kid II doesn't give us any emotional movement in Daniel's character, or Miyagi's, or their relationship, either -- it just recapitulates them. The only character who changes in the story, in fact, is Sato, whom you couldn't care a fried fig about."
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,80,"Lots of laughs, lots of fisticuffs, lots of cool toys, lots of stuff getting blown up: Who could ask for anything more from a summer movie?"

Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,70,A movie that's dazzling as you watch it and immediately unsatisfying afterward.
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,60,"The film's gadgetry is pricier, but the leering is strictly the Playboy joke page circa 1967."
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,60,Those expecting the quick wit and inventiveness of the television series will certainly be disappointed.
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,60,The film sacrifices playfulness and humor to concentrate on a relentless display of elaborate but ho-hum gadgets and gizmos.
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,58,"The movie's problem is that it's a cartoon, offering no emotional involvement with its characters and no dramatic imperative."
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,50,"A wild, wanton and wasteful western farce that's so overblown and underwritten it almost makes you cringe to watch it."
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,50,"These pictures need a light touch and a lot of attitude, but this time you can hear heavy breathing in the background."
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,50,It cares far more about herding audiences into theaters than about what they hear or see.

Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,50,"As impressive as the industrial-style special effects may be, they're both too much and not enough for this mild mild West."
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,40,"A mish-mash of special effects, tasteless comedy and pointless action."
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,38,Wild Wild West isn't just a bad adaptation of a TV series; it's a bad film.
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,33,The fusion of cheekiness and deliberately overscaled fantasy never jells.
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,30,"The humor is, at best, thudding. At its worst, it's breathtakingly stupid and offensive."
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,30,"The script by S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock (Ghost Dad) is so jumbled and the direction so chaotic that it's often hard to tell what's going on -- where, when, and why."
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,30,"From the look of this film, its prime appreciators will be heavy-metal futurist dweebs."
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,25,All concept and no content.
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,20,"Wild Wild Waste is more like it. Waste of time, waste of money and colossal waste of talent."
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,20,"A rambling wreck from computer tech and a helluva souvenir - that is, for those interested in artifacts representing the American movie at its worst."
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,10,"Aside from the pesky problems of tone and lazy writing, the whole move is a little choppy."
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,10,"So extremely stupid and incompetent, I doubt that even the most impartial critic could find much to praise."
Wild Wild West,4.9,113805681,10,"The movie is exhausting, utterly without feeling, and pointless -- though Smith looks great in his Western outfit."

The Patriot,7.2,113330342,90,Doesn't try too hard to be anything other than a vicarious experience that makes you crave the satisfaction you know you'll get when the hero gets his revenge.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,80,"It has everything you want in an epic: sweep, scope, wild reversals of fortune and plenty of bold, basic emotions."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,80,"Sentimental, overbearing, flag-waving--and a crowd-pleaser."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,80,"If Emmerich had any sense, he would have ceded the direction of the battle scenes to his star."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,Has a flag-waving dumbness at its core.

The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,"What might have been a treat for history buffs and a refresher course for the rest of us turns into just another occasion to watch Gibson shoot guns, swing tomahawks, and wreak other kinds of havoc on enemies we've been primed to hate."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,"Emmerich might have had a masterpiece, but he'll have to settle for what comes close to being a must-see movie today."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,"It's often corny, but it's never boring, and it'll sweep you up in its momentum if you give it a chance."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,The best movie I've seen about the Revolutionary War.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,It's depressing that this first movie in years to dramatize the American Revolution has so little to do with the politics of secession and so much to do with pop-culture themes of vigilantism.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,70,"Mostly, the movie is riveting, well-done fare -- the stuff of Hollywood epic adventure."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,70,Has some emotional pull and isn't stuffy and dull.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,70,"Only so much (pop)cornball tubthumping, a sweeping, occasionally stirring, always gorgeous bit of action-figure history."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,70,"There's no denying that Emmerich's film, though a good half hour too long, keeps us watching."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,70,"""We, the people"" have never been big fans of movies about the American Revolutionary War. The Patriot, however, appears to be the movie that will break that historical jinx."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,67,It's a death-wish revenge thriller posing as a lavishly pastoral historical epic.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,67,"Far from the smart historical epic some might have expected, is just another feisty summer shoot-'em-up."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,63,"As a whole, though, the movie is much less magnetic or believable than its star."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,63,"While the film contains some terrific, realistically bloody battle scenes, it has a distinctly Germanic feel, both in its epic heaviness and in the peculiar way it revises the history of the American Revolution."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,63,"Gibson's performance is robbed of his customary humor, and he flounders around in search of the character's core."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,60,"Patriot reflects on nothing, except perhaps that the American Revolution was a golden opportunity for Mel Gibson to go postal."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,60,"Shamelessly stirring, brandishing Mr. Gibson's anguished masculinity like a musket. It may be effective, but you leave the theater feeling used."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,60,"Trots out more flag-waving wartime cliches than any movie since John Wayne's ""The Alamo."""
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,Does benefit from Gibson's charisma...Whether it is quite good enough is another question.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,"A movie of cornball sentiment, humorously anachronistic dialogue, and expensive Colonial Williamsburg sets."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,"The film is long, empty and bogus."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,"Seems likely to stir rebuttal from historians, especially those on the other side of the pond."

The Patriot,7.2,113330342,44,Overblown sanctimony and sentimentalism as corny as the Fourth of July.
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,60,Has sufficient mayhem to please Diesel's action fans while allowing the star to reach out to family audiences.
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,50,"Here's a bizarre hodgepodge of influences: ""Kindergarten Cop"" meets ""Sound of Music,"" filtered through the Hulk Hogan movie ""Mr. Nanny."" The formula, by now so overused it's actually formless, is pure Disney"
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,50,Mr. Diesel could not have succeeded as a genre-switcher without the proven television talents of the film's able ensemble.
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,50,"All very nice, sometimes we smile, but there's nothing compelling."
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,50,"Unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger, however, Vin Diesel shows no discernible comedic skills."
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,50,"Don't expect perfection, and you'll emerge from this goofy movie all in one piece, with reasonably entertained kids and a milder headache."
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,50,It's the sort of stuff younger viewers will love.
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,50,"Low on Diesel fuel, though probably amusing enough if you're part of the intended demographic, which appears to be the age group that likes to stick fingers up noses."
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,40,Vin Diesel is out of his element in this lame family comedy.
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,40,"Most of the occasional chuckles are provided by the spunky York, who really gives Diesel a run for his money."
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,40,"If auds swallow this odoriferous exercise in calculated career repositioning, they'll swallow anything."
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,38,Cheerful but mind-numbing.
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,38,Offensive because it offers little more than unleavened stupidity in the place of the family-friendly action and comedy it promises.
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,38,"Director Adam Shankman pushes together scenes with little rhythm or flow. Writers Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant ignore credibility, throw in pointless sight gags, treat humiliation as comedy and use tiresome ethnic stereotypes. In short, Diesel doesn't get the help he needs."
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,38,"JUST worth your children's time, and hardly worth yours."
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,33,A yawn-by-numbers romper-room dud.
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,30,"With no real comedy to enjoy, it's torture to watch Diesel undergo a predictable change from emotionless soldier to loving family man. Makes you want to spit out your pacifier in disgust."
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,30,Director Adam Shankman (Bringing Down the House) can't block a sight gag to save his life.
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,30,"Revealing hitherto unseen depths of stiffness, Diesel stumbles badly in the role."
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,30,Disney misfire.
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,25,Ultimately this soppy Pacifier sucks.
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,25,An abysmal comedy that should have been strangled in its crib.
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,25,"If the once red-hot Vin Diesel's overhyped career wasn't finished off by last summer's mega flop ""The Chronicles of Riddick,"" the alleged family comedy The Pacifier ought to do the trick."
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,25,Diesel valiantly but unsuccessfully tries to raise this inane bit of Mr. Mommery above its afternoon-special standing.
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,25,It just plain sucks.
The Pacifier,5.6,113086868,20,Is it funny? Not for a minute.

Spy Kids,5.5,112719001,75,"By emphasizing surreal humor and fast-paced action instead, Rodriguez has crafted a prepubescent version of James Bond without aping that series' style."
Spy Kids,5.5,112719001,75,It's entertaining and inoffensive.
Spy Kids,5.5,112719001,75,"Rodriguez has made a movie for kids, and the most and least that can be said about it is that parents, while hardly being catered to, will experience profound relief that the movie knows how to entertain and does so."
Spy Kids,5.5,112719001,75,"As a piece of almost dadaist filmmaking, Spy Kids is great fun with its continual spirit of invention."

Spy Kids,5.5,112719001,70,"Energetic and slickly done, but also somewhat soulless."
Spy Kids,5.5,112719001,70,One lousy little movie -- utterly devoid of any real originality or charm.
Ghostbusters II,6.5,112494738,80,"Even the special effects are more to the point of the comedy than they were in the first film. For some reason, this appears to leave more room for the sort of random funny business that Mr. Murray and his friends do best, or to which they react with most aplomb."
Ghostbusters II,6.5,112494738,80,"Ghostbusters II is babyboomer silliness. Kids will find the oozing slime and ghastly, ghostly apparitions to their liking and adults will enjoy the preposterously clever dialog."
Ghostbusters II,6.5,112494738,80,"Here, the comedy breathes, and the illusion that it's not a factory-assembled product (which it most certainly is) is a nifty one. For a major studio blockbuster, the thing is darned chummy, and above all, that rare, modest thing, a good show."
Ghostbusters II,6.5,112494738,70,"Everything and everyone you liked in the original are there. But GB II often seems like ""Ghostbusters: The Preview Reel, Extended Mix,"" with its rather see-through buffet of special effects, comic bits and music-video transitions."
Ghostbusters II,6.5,112494738,70,"Rather wan in its anything-goes spirit of invention, the movie has a surprisingly low number of laughs; some of the initial premises are good, but there's very little energy in the follow-through, and this time Murray's listlessness seems more anemic than comic."
Ghostbusters II,6.5,112494738,63,"Ghostbusters II is such a lazy effort that the formula machinery is laid bare for all to see. It suffers from writing that is obvious, sloppy, and unimaginative."

Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,80,"One of the best part 3's ever made, and Rodriguez's knack for concocting the most imaginatively deranged children's entertainments since ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" remains unassailed."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,80,"Filled with video-game in-jokes, Spy Kids 3 comes roaring to life in action scenes based on different gaming genres, each of which takes full advantage of the 3-D effects."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,75,"Amid the razzle-dazzle, Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is sweetly inspiring."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,75,"Rodriguez manages to work in some nicely cornball messages (family togetherness and forgiveness is good, Stallone doing comedy is bad) and theatergoers get to walk out with their very own way-cool cardboard anaglyphic eyeglasses."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,75,"It's ''The Matrix'' meets ''TRON'' meets ''Jimmy Neutron,'' with all the cheery (if not cheesy) evanescence of a Jolly Rancher commercial. I mean that as a compliment."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,75,"In a summer in which every blockbuster is zealous to be a video game, Rodriguez, with a wink, has produced his own."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,70,Rodriguez has a sure sense of scale and pacing as well as an artisan's relaxed control of the material.
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,70,Bears a wealth of imaginative riches and a signature mix of outre personalities and gadgets.
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,63,"Easily the slightest and most frenetic entry in the trilogy. But it might also turn out to be the fan favorite, because the movie is nothing but eye candy and visual sensation."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,63,"It's an awkward technique that outlived its usefulness more than four decades ago. I like the movie, but hate its presentation."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,63,"Stay through to the end credits, where the two child protagonists (Sabara and Vega) are shown as they were then and as they are now. Rodriguez's best achievement is in spotting the innate talent that would shine through in those two kids."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,63,"The filmmaker's imagination is too rich for Spy Kids 3-D to be written off as a failure. But it's too bad that while the visuals have gained a dimension, the story has lost one."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,60,"An enjoyable, noisy romp."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,60,"It's hard to dislike a movie this light-hearted, but there's something terribly ephemeral about it as well; it's a film of complete weightlessness."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,60,"Aims for the fun and sensation of being inside a video game, but not a whole lot more."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,60,Some viewers will miss the warmth and boisterous family dynamics of its predecessors.
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,50,"Good intentions are no substitute for good filmmaking, and Spy Kids 3D is nothing more than a retread in flashier clothing."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,50,"Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over, is still offbeat, but more in the sense of unco-ordinated than syncopated."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,50,Its visual thrills are chilly and wearying compared with the other films' quirky humanity. It's not a megamovie; it's a Sega movie.
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,50,"A movie designed to wow winds up feeling cold, not, ya know, cool; the charm of the 2001 original has been decimated, its heart replaced with a microprocessor."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,50,Starts off with a burst of energy but becomes tedious midway through.
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,50,"SK3D, alas, banks it all on a dead-end VR aesthetic, albeit one emitting a certain black-hole fascination."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,50,"In sum, it's a quintessential summer film, especially if you're 8 years old and in the mood for a quick dose of mindless fun."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,40,"Overall it's a harmless disappointment, hampered by the thin story and a surprisingly dreary looking video-game setting, heavy on the floating platforms, cartoony future-cityscapes and goofy gadgetry."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,40,"The climax, like the film itself, is big, loud, and looks cool enough, which is what weve come to expect from summer movies  but not from Robert Rodriguez."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,38,"Combined with the eyestrain produced by the cheap cardboard 3-D glasses, the resulting vertigo is decidedly unpleasant -- although having moon rocks and blobs of cream pie flying out from the screen is kinda cool in a retro way."
Spy Kids 3: Game Over,4.2,111761982,38,"Robert Rodriguez has somehow misplaced his energy, his flair and his humor in this third film, which is a flat and dreary disappointment."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,88,"The picture is solidly crafted, performed to the hilt and full of humor."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,80,"An enormously entertaining visit to planet paranoia, but its escapist pleasures titillate only in direct proportion to the degree of persecution complex that you bring into the theater with you."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,80,"Bruckheimer and director Tony Scott have wisely set their course by Will Smith, who is sensational in a dramatic role that leans on him to carry a movie without the help of aliens or Big Willie-style jokes for every occasion."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,80,"It has a hurtling pace, nonstop intensity and a stylish, appealing performance by Will Smith in his first real starring role."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,80,A solid and satisfying commercial venture with more than enough pizazz to overcome occasional lapses in moment-to-moment plausibility.
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,78,"A kicky, knockout thriller that ingeniously taps into the current climate of paranoia surrounding personal privacy in the Information Age."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,75,"It offers a solid two hours of pure, escapist entertainment."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,75,"Everything you would want from a Big Brother film: Good-looking, preachy in an Old West kind of way, wobbling between humor and murder, hellbent and periodically brilliant."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,75,"In too much of a hurry to be much of a people picture. And the standoff at the end edges perilously close to the ridiculous, for a movie that's tried so hard to be plausible."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,75,"A high-adrenaline, high-concept action thriller that mixes hot-button issues of privacy and surveillance, easy-to-identify good and bad guys, attention-getting stars, and well-choreographed chase scenes."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,70,"The social criticism is as unforced as the humor (and the references to ""The Conversation"") in this 1998 conspiracy thriller, whose spirited action is balanced by an almost contemplative attitude toward surveillance phobias and the movie cliches they've spawned."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,70,"Enemy of the State isn't really a smart film, but it makes a concerted stab at pretending to be one."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,70,The scary fun of the movie is embodied in a brilliantly filmed and edited chase sequence in which Smith tries to escape the ubiquitous cyber-eyes that see every inch of his flight.
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,70,"This paranoid thriller has all the failings we expect...but Enemy of the State also has enough wit, talent and narrative thrust to mostly transcend those flaws, at least until that ludicrous finish."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,70,"Sporadically entertaining, though it lacks the kind of political urgency and emotional resonance so crucial to many similarly themed '70s movies."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,60,"Tony Scott's thriller is flashy, but it's not dead stupid and it's never dull."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,60,"The movie goes like the wind, but it's more a technological exercise than anything else."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,60,"The dazzle doesn't make up, however, for the movie's lack of depth."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,50,"The strong parts are the rip-offs of ""The Conversation."" The worst part is the lack of understandable character motivations."
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,50,A frustrating film that feels cobbled together.
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,50,To say Enemy of the State is senseless is an understatement. This is a movie where logic is the enemy.
Enemy of the State,7.3,111549836,50,"The movie has plenty of high-tech power, spinning out action so explosive you'll hardly notice how preposterous the story is or how cardboard-thin the characters are."
Spy,7,110825712,100,"It's a comedy of exasperation where, for once, the joke isn't on McCarthy, but on everyone who can't see her skills."
Spy,7,110825712,90,"As McCarthy and Byrne carry on a filthy volley of insults (with what is surely secret sisterly glee), Feig keeps his Spy machinery cranking so smoothly that nothing said or done feels as outrageous as, in fact, it is. The truth serum Spy drops into our fizzy drinks makes us feel so good that we don’t even realize we’ve been schooled."
Spy,7,110825712,90,Spy lampoons sexism without abandoning sex — a tough tone for a comedy to strike but one that Feig and McCarthy manage to accomplish with both a sense of justice and a sense of humor.
Spy,7,110825712,90,"It is, in short, a generous, smart, sexy comedy, surrounding this generous, smart, sexy star. About time."
Spy,7,110825712,90,"Laugh-stuffed and making excellent use of its marquee-grade supporting cast, it promises to be a home run in its early summer release."
Spy,7,110825712,90,An uproarious blast of globe-trotting action-comedy delirium that doesn’t spoof the espionage-thriller genre so much as drop a series of banana peels in its path.
Spy,7,110825712,88,"Feig, who wrote the Spy screenplay, encouraging his actors to improvise along the way, has his own stealth mission. For all the over-the-top comedy, zigzagging chases, and choreographed fight scenes, Spy is very much a tale of female empowerment."
Spy,7,110825712,88,"All the actors come up aces. And let's bottle the delicious byplay between McCarthy and Byrne, whose comic timing is bitchy perfection."
Spy,7,110825712,83,"McCarthy’s mind just seems to race in a faster gear than her costars, allowing her to blast off arias of profane put-downs with such speed and demented originality that her mouth practically shoots sparks. As a physical comedian, she possesses the greatest gift of all: She’s totally unafraid of looking stupid."
Spy,7,110825712,83,"There is a giddy sense of glee that runs through most of this movie, making it feel like Feig can barely contain himself with all of the things he wants to do and show you in the movie."
Spy,7,110825712,82,"Spy would be a standout if only for its ability to keep me laughing while also keeping me from figuring out who was really double-crossing whom. Add to that this extraordinary ensemble of actors (who knew Jason Statham could be this funny?), and you’ve got another memorable offering from McCarthy and Feig."
Spy,7,110825712,80,"Spy may not be a great movie, but it is great fun. And at times it will have you wondering if there's that much of a difference."
Spy,7,110825712,80,"Spy is hilarious and heartfelt, a terrific movie."
Spy,7,110825712,80,"Spy never lets its genre conceit get in the way of its comedy, which delivers more laugh-out-loud moments than any other mainstream comedy so far this year."
Spy,7,110825712,80,"The busy, silly script allows Ms. McCarthy to be her own best sidekick, in effect an entire sketch-comedy troupe unto herself."
Spy,7,110825712,80,"A whip-smart blend of savvy parody, elegant slapstick and zinger-packed dialogue makes for the year’s most rewarding character comedy so far, and McCarthy’s best showcase to date."
Spy,7,110825712,80,"The supporting cast is a kick. Law gets to send up the Bond role, something he could very well have played in his younger days; Allison Janney fills her boots as the angry head of the agency and Statham, frankly, should only ever play this role for the rest of his life."
Spy,7,110825712,80,"Spy confirms Feig’s and McCarthy’s instinct for both the zeitgeist and the funnybone, and is sure to ramp up anticipation for Ghostbusters even higher – as well as being a delight in its own right."
Spy,7,110825712,80,"This is a generous, consistently pleasurable comedy."
Spy,7,110825712,75,Nobody is better than McCarthy at over-the-top comic hostility.
Spy,7,110825712,75,"As a distaff version of James Bond in Spy, Hollywood’s reigning empress of ha-ha Melissa McCarthy has a license to not just kill the audience with laughter but also to slay us with her acting skills."
Spy,7,110825712,75,"Feig blends a keen sense of physical comedy and exquisite timing with all the requisite spy-flick tropes, from the trippy and stylish opening credits to surprisingly violent, bone-breaking action scenes that he refrains from playing for laughs."
Spy,7,110825712,75,"Spy is a foul-mouthed, often hilariously disgusting, slightly padded comedy that soars on the strengths of writer-director Paul Feig’s wonderfully idiotic script and nimble camerawork, and the bountiful comedic talents of Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne and Jason Statham."
Spy,7,110825712,75,The character is sweetly sympathetic — less “Tammy” than “Mike & Molly” — and the laughs and chaos are all the more infectious for it.
Spy,7,110825712,75,"The fun of Spy comes in watching the right actors mess with their own images, blithely."
Spy,7,110825712,75,"Spy, similarly, doesn’t exactly send up James Bond or Jason Bourne espionage thrillers, but it places McCarthy in the middle of the action while subverting the traditionally male domination of that arena."
Spy,7,110825712,75,"It's the sustained, full-bodied mania of Melissa McCarthy's performance that anchors the film's many winning blind-alley gags."
Spy,7,110825712,75,"Feig's commitment to the genre, and some truly wonderful set pieces, make Spy as lovable as its main character."
Spy,7,110825712,70,"McCarthy has much more to discover about herself as an actor and an avatar and a cultural signifier, and I hope she doesn’t get trapped by one role, one genre or one franchise. But her campaign of conquest is going well."
Spy,7,110825712,67,"Some of the combat scenes work, including a kitchen-set hand-to-hand battle that's one of the movie's highlights, but more often they feel superfluous at best."
Spy,7,110825712,63,"The problem is that writer/director Paul Feig became too enamored with his storyline which, at best, could be described as a lame James Bond parody."
Spy,7,110825712,63,"As cinema, Spy is content to cater to its own conventions, hit the required marks and earn a few laughs along the way. As a cultural bellwether, it does something bigger and more important, without ever italicizing that fact."
Spy,7,110825712,63,"The fights and deaths are somewhat comical, the one-liners hit or miss and the stunts faked with less sleight of hand than a director experienced in action might have managed. And Feig can’t bear to end this thing, which goes on far past the point of endurance. But he’s done better by McCarthy here, and she has delivered a performance that’s more deft than her usual daft."
Spy,7,110825712,60,"Spy boasts tons of the type of low-humor that fuel so many Seth Rogen and Will Ferrell frat-boy movies. The difference here is that the laughs aren't at the expense of the fat kid. By the time the closing credits roll, McCarthy's character been built up, not torn down -- and we're rooting for her, not guffawing at her."
Spy,7,110825712,60,"Feig keeps throwing so much stuff at you — gross-out gags, chases, brutal violence, not to mention actors working their heads off — that he finally wears down your resistance. In the end, I admired him for keeping this ramshackle construction together, casting performers I adore, and proving that Melissa McCarthy can, indeed, hold a gun. A mixed victory. A definitively mixed review."
Spy,7,110825712,60,The moments when Spy falls apart are when the film fancies itself the real thing. The times when it works are due to its leading lady.
Spy,7,110825712,60,"Though it’s been two years since they collaborated on ""The Heat,"" Spy makes the case that Feig and McCarthy are still just warming up."
Spy,7,110825712,50,"This is a different sort of comedy that more or less succeeds on its own terms, despite that fact that you find yourself rooting for the post-Snowden CIA."
Spy,7,110825712,50,"Alas, “sad case” is not how we want to see McCarthy; it’s frustrating to see her spend more than half the movie being the pathetic target of jokes rather than the dominating figure she was in “Bridesmaids” and “The Heat,” both of which are far funnier than this one."
Spy,7,110825712,38,"With the overlong, limp and lazy Spy, Feig has lost his mojo."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,100,"It's raunchy, outspoken -- and also a smart and agile dissection of art, fame, and the chutzpah of big-budget productions."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,100,The movie is laugh-until-your-stomach-hurts hilarious.
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,90,"Tropic Thunder is the funniest movie of the summer--so funny, in fact, that you start laughing before the film itself has begun."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,90,"An imperfect work of genius, a satire of Hollywood excess and vanity that dares to tread territory laden with minefields."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,90,"If you go see Tropic Thunder this weekend, don't be late. The four fake ads that open the movie are perhaps the apex of its considerable comic invention."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,88,"From Downey Jr.'s purposely racist embodiment of African-American anachronisms to Black's scatological humor, everything in Tropic Thunder qualifies as satire, not spoof. It's an important distinction. Pauline Kael once noted that ""unlike satire, spoofing has no serious objectives; it doesn't attack anything that anyone could take seriously; it has no cleansing power."""
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,88,"If you wait through the credits, you get one last joke in the fine print: The actors shot the whole movie in Hawaii, on the fabulously lush island of Kauai. So while they were shooting a story about indulged prima donnas, they were working themselves in one of the most tourist-friendly spots on Earth. You've gotta smile at that."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,88,"When it's all over, you'll probably have the fondest memories of Robert Downey Jr.'s work. It's been a good year for him, this one coming after ""Iron Man."" He's back, big time."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,88,"A knockout of a comedy that keeps you laughing constantly. It's also killer smart, lacing combustible action with explosive gags."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,83,Maybe Stiller just seems stilted because he's the only one here who isn't playing to the rafters.
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,80,Stiller manages his movie nicely so that all actors get their share of the comic spotlight. Seldom does an ensemble comedy not contain a single weak character or performance as does this one.
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,80,"The history of filmmakers skewering Hollywood's darker excesses is a long and rich one, from Billy Wilder through Robert Altman. With Tropic Thunder, a rude, crude, over-the-top satire about rude, crude, over-the-top action movies, Ben Stiller makes an ambitious and surprisingly effective bid to join those vaunted ranks."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,78,"Instead of entering the jungle to find the heart of darkness, Stiller (the director, co-star, and co-writer of Tropic Thunder) goes in to take aim at the Achilles heel of Hollywood: its utter pomposity and self-importance."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,75,"In the end Tropic Thunder is an expensive goof about an expensive goof, and the results are very impressive and fancy-looking."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,75,"Tropic Thunder understands movies, understands the system in which they are created and, most of all, knows what it takes to make an audience roar with laughter."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,75,"Raunchy, raucous and riotously funny."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,75,Downey is absurdly funny.
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,75,"At its best, Tropic Thunder wrings divine madness from wretched excess."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,75,"Despite its contradictions, the film stayed with me after I left the theater. It's frivolous. But it's also powerfully surreal."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,75,Basically a mega-budget war movie that makes fun of mega-budget war movies.
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,75,"Fairly lightweight, going after targets we can all agree deserve the needle. But there are five, six, seven gags you've never seen before -- real surprises- -- and the film deploys them smartly to keep you laughing and unsteady for the duration."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,75,Cruise is downright scary. It's the creepiest -- and most entertaining -- performance since his unforgettable appearance in that Scientology video.
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,75,"Biting as it tries to be, Tropic Thunder is mostly toothless. Its targets – Hollywood vanity, Hollywood tantrums – are easy hits."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,70,"All over the map, but it's worth enduring the botched gags, formula plotting, and even the racism to marvel at the genius of Robert Downey Jr."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,70,"Those opening trailers are hilarious and devastatingly acute, but the rest of Stiller's film could be more a deconstruction of comedy than a display of it. The brain gets the joke; the ribs are untickled."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,70,There is genuine humor and palpable satiric intent underneath the waves of unnerving bad taste and political incorrectness.
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,70,"Although this ­satire of Hollywood inanity isn't the comic ­classic it could have been, Downey's gonzo performance is a must-see."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,70,"To top everything off, Tom Cruise may just have resurrected his career with the role of Les Grossman."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,67,"Some of the writing is very smart, its strain of show-business satire is dead-on and often hilarious, and some of the performances have an insanity and intensity reminiscent of ""Dr. Strangelove."""
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,63,"The frustratingly uneven comedy Tropic Thunder has moments of full-on, bust-a-gut hilarity, along with long stretches where you can hear the crickets chirping in the theater."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,60,"Apart from startling, out-there comic turns by Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise, however, the antics here are pretty thin, redundant and one-note."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,60,"Never lives up to the hilarity of the opening, partly because the large-scale production smothers the gags but mostly because those gags are so easy to smother."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,60,"Like this summer's other slapstick cause célèbre, ""Pineapple Express,"" it's a comedy with as high or higher a body count as the movies it purports to be parodying, and the problem isn't the violence per se but rather the fact that neither movie ever finds a satisfactory balance between tongue-in-cheek and guts-in-hand."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,60,"There are moments of comedy grandeur, but this isn't as consistently funny as you'd hope. Nevertheless, Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus is instantly up there with the comedy greats."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,50,That's the thing about satire: It doesn't play past its expiration date. And everything about Tropic Thunder already feels antiquated.
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,50,"A flashy, nasty, on-and-off funny and assaultive sendup of the film industry."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,50,Tropic Thunder is an assault in the guise of a comedy – watching it is like getting mugged by a clown.
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,50,"Like a dinner whose hors d'oeuvres are far more satisfying and well-composed than the slightly warmed-over main course. Among them are the inspired mock movie trailers and the fake ad that precede ""Thunder's"" opening credits."
Tropic Thunder,7,110515313,50,"The over-all effect is bizarre, daring you to be amused by something both brilliant and bristling with offense; if you sidle out at the end, feeling half guilty at what you just conspired in, then Stiller has trapped you precisely where he wants you."
'Crocodile' Dundee II,5.6,109305000,70,"Crocodile Dundee II has been attractively photographed, if unremarkably directed, and it aims for affable, low-key escapism just as the first film did. But the earlier one had novelty to keep it going, and this time the novelty has begun to wear thin, even if Mr. Hogan remains generally irresistible."
'Crocodile' Dundee II,5.6,109305000,63,"It's comfortable and Disneyfied and, with shots of the splendid Australian wilderness filling the long valleys between dramatic peaks, probably the safest way to travel."
'Crocodile' Dundee II,5.6,109305000,50,"None of the energy of Mick Dundee's first foray has crept into this sequel, despite it being so close on the heels of the original. A must for lovers of the weathered outback and the even-more weathered Paul Hogan only."
'Crocodile' Dundee II,5.6,109305000,50,A surprisingly shoddy affair that abandons the unabashed romance of its predecessor for a rudimentary action-adventure plot involving guns and drugs.
'Crocodile' Dundee II,5.6,109305000,40,Crocodile Dundee II is a disappointing follow-up to the disarmingly charming first feature with Aussie star Paul Hogan. Sequel is too slow to constitute an adventure and has too few laughs to be a comedy.
'Crocodile' Dundee II,5.6,109305000,40,"Paul Hogan has an easy plan: Simply be Mick Crocodile Dundee and the rest will follow. The rest is Crocodile Dundee II, and it doesn't follow so much as drag itself along like an alligator on dry land."
'Crocodile' Dundee II,5.6,109305000,40,"The sequel exacerbates problems already too evident in the first movie, most painfully the near-total disposability of Kozlowski’s Sue, who spends most of the time reacting to Mick’s quirks with chuckles. No battle of wits, no rejoinders. Sue accepts Mick’s ways wholesale; there’s never any hint at a possible tension between their lifestyles."
'Crocodile' Dundee II,5.6,109305000,40,"The first Crocodile picture -- which went on to become the most profitable foreign film ever made -- wasn't great entertainment, but it was light, companionable and essentially inoffensive. Compared with the sequel, though, it looks like a masterpiece."
'Crocodile' Dundee II,5.6,109305000,38,"It is much less understandable, and not at all forgivable, that in eschewing the culture-clash comedy of the first film for generic action, the filmmakers forgot they were making a comedy at all."
Superman II,6.8,108185706,100,"With his perfect pacing, elegant narrative design, and depth of characterization, Richard Lester has made as good a matinee movie as could be imagined: it's a big, generous, beautifully crafted piece of entertainment, with the distinctive Lester touch in the busy backgrounds and the throwaway dialogue."
Superman II,6.8,108185706,100,It brings the fantastic into our everyday lives; it delights in showing us the reaction of the man on the street to Superman's latest stunt.
Superman II,6.8,108185706,100,"It boasts a more consistent tone, better special effects (such as villains throwing buses around like paper planes), and even an affecting love story."
Superman II,6.8,108185706,88,"Superman II delivers on the promise hinted at in ""Superman."" Which is the better film? That's a hard choice to make, since both succeed in different ways."
Superman II,6.8,108185706,88,"Poking fun at its American mythos, but never descending into camp comedy, this sequel makes for a wonderful time."
Superman II,6.8,108185706,88,"A marvelous toy. It's funny, it's full of tricks and it manages to be royally entertaining, which is really all it aims for."
Superman II,6.8,108185706,80,"Superman II emerges as a solid, classy, cannily constructed piece of entertainment which gets down to action almost immediately."
Superman II,6.8,108185706,80,"A stylish, well-paced film with a good variety of moods and moves."
Superman II,6.8,108185706,80,Manages to gain classic comic book feature status through a combination of great stunts and a great human angle.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,Baby Driver zooms onto the screen with an exhilarating combination of smarts and style.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"This is the song of the summer in movie form, a playful ode to car chases, Motown, diners, that moment when you find the exact tune that matches your mood, driving stick, crime capers, ’80s movies and love."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"It all works. All of it. The music, the performances, the twists and turns in the plot, the sheer energy and life force of the movie."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,[An] outrageously enjoyable petrolhead heist caper.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"Style is the substance of Edgar Wright's inventive heist flick, a fresh, masterful synching of music and getaway mayhem, as if La La Land's traffic jam was moving, armed and dangerous."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"As he proves yet again in his thrillingly syncopated heist movie Baby Driver, the 43-year-old U.K.-born Edgar Wright is just about the perfect 21st-century genre director. He has a fanboy’s scintillating palette — flesh-eating zombies, righteous vigilante cops, stoic bank robbers in sunglasses — without a fanboy’s lack of peripheral vision."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"An awe-inspiring piece of filmmaking from Edgar Wright that plays out as a musical through the lens of an action thriller. Sweet, funny and utterly original — you won’t see a film like it this year."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"The mechanisms at work in Baby Driver, while calibrated with hair’s-breadth precision, are nothing new. Here’s what is: the sheer glee with which the film prods around in its own clockwork to show you what spins what."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"No Hollywood suit and no diehard fan could have had the foresight to picture something like this, namely because nobody but Wright had any idea what this was supposed to be. This is something that’s been brewing inside his head for over two decades, and that unquestionable dedication, confidence, and passion fuels each and every scene of Baby Driver."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,91,"With Wright in the driver’s seat, your standard getaway driver story is transformed into a giddy, adrenaline-filled joyride that’ll leave you gripping the edge of your seat and tapping your feet."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,91,"Like Baby, Wright just wants to feel the music. He makes us feel it, too, one spectacular pleasure high after another."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,91,"The director’s most ambitious work to date is a wildly successful romantic heist comedy, propelled from scene to scene with a lively soundtrack that elevates its slick chase scenes into a realm of musicality that develops its own satisfying beat."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,Sensationally entertaining.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,"Baby Driver is an almost perfect pastiche, a thoroughly enjoyable object. But sue me, I kind of miss the losers of the Cornetto Trilogy."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,"Wright has orchestrated every swerve and near smashup—and one glorious foot chase—with precision, a rarity in action filmmaking these days."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,"It’s a seemingly straightforward “one last job” crime tale mashed up with a jukebox musical romance, part high-octane action flick and part music video, propelled by perfectly calibrated performances and a wicked sense of humor."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,This is movie craftsmanship and showmanship of a very high order.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,"Amid all the high-speed action, this “Baby” is also spiked with humor. In large part that's thanks to Spacey and Foxx, as well as Jon Hamm, who makes the bank robber Buddy, one of his better movie roles. Having such strong actors also brings a gravitas to the story."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,"Baby Driver, Wright’s first-ever solo screenplay, is a thrilling and original cinematic joyride that pays homage to heist masterpieces while creating a legacy of its own."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,89,"It’s that feeling of seeing something unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. It’s the experience of witnessing the fresh, the new. And if you love movies, there’s nothing like it."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,Sometimes I just want a movie that kicks ass. And Edgar Wright’s Baby Driver delivers.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,"Baby Driver is the best time I’ve had at the movies in months, and, if the world is too much with you (as it is for many of us these days), you may feel the same. It’s a dazzling diversion, a series of cinematic highs that achieve the giddiness of not great art but great entertainment (and thus art through the back door)."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,"Now this is what I call a summer movie. Baby Driver has it all: thrills, laughs, sex, nonstop action, a killer soundtrack, a star-making performance from Ansel Elgort and a director – Edgar Wright – who can knock the wind out of you."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,"It’s uncannily choreographed, with gestures and movements timed precisely to the soundtrack’s beat."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,Wright is savvy enough to realize that suspense and tension require characters that are more than human figures in a CGI playground. He does just enough with the men and women populating Baby Driver for us to get a sense of who they are.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,"Baby Driver feels both influenced by the modern era of self-aware, pop-culture filmmaking and charmingly old-fashioned at the same time, which is only one of its minor miracles. It’s as much fun as you’re going to have in a movie theater this year."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,Baby Driver literalizes Edgar Wright’s fascination with people’s emotional overreliance on pop culture as a cover for arrested development.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,85,"Even though the story isn't as impactful as its stylized packaging, Wright creates a delightful new film that is sure to satisfy his legions of fans."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,83,"Wright doesn’t simply apply technical precision and innovation to genre-smart storytelling — he also makes what must be exhausting work look like so much fun. And as a crime caper, heist movie, mob tale, puppy-love romance, jukebox-musical-of-sorts, Baby Driver is almost nothing but."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,83,"The concept of the car chase suffered in limbo for too long with inexperienced directors too often cutting corners instead of respecting why films like “The French Connection,” “Bullitt” and “Ronin” are still held in high regard today. Like all great students, Wright tips his hat to the teachers and refuses to phone in the camerawork on his stunts."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,82,"Best of all are the car chases, which Wright choreographs with the same blend of wit and technical finesse he brought to the pool-cue, “Don’t Stop Me Now” zombie rumble in Shaun of the Dead."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"The script is well-paced and packed with twists and turns that offers little in the way of respites to the beautiful mayhem. The characters, too, are wonderfully realised through the performances from the entire cast, each making a big impression no matter how long they're on screen."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"The result is a supercharged piece of fun unlike any motorized choreography since John Landis destroyed a fleet of cop cars in ""The Blues Brothers."""
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"A subtly innovative blend of cars, guns, music and old-school cool, it's also one of those increasingly rare creatures in Hollywood: an undeniably original movie."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"There’s much to enjoy in Baby Driver, including the satisfactions of genuine cinematic craft and technique, qualities that moviegoers can no longer take for granted."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"There’s a hint of artificiality to it. Maybe it’s an allegory, but the meaning hidden therein seems simply to be: go faster. Nothing wrong with that. It’s not as if Wright was shooting for something deeper and missed."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"Crime, romance, fast cars, hot tunes... slicker than your chrome hubcaps, Baby Driver is the summer’s coolest movie."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"Baby Driver is exhilarating, fantastically entertaining, and mildly frustrating, all at the same time."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"A crime-flick love story as Pop-conscious as Wright's earlier work but unironic about its romantic core, it will delight the director's fans but requires no film-geek certification."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"At its headiest, it’s like Singin’ in the Rain with a souped-up engine, but even if Baby is the Gene Kelly of the getaway car, watching Baby Driver always feels like watching someone else do the driving rather than being behind the wheel yourself."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"Having hooked us with style, Wright knows he has to deliver on the story, and he does. His plotting is tight and fluid, wild and ultimately satisfying. It’s the ultimate cliche to compare a movie to a thrill ride, but sometimes the cliche applies."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"When all cylinders are pumping, Baby Driver is an enchanting experiment that puts the pedal to the metal. And even a few off notes can’t stop the beat of Wright’s fast and furious symphony."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"It's a thrill to watch it unfold, but the slick filmmaking combined with familiar tropes precludes most spontaneity."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"Baby Driver is fast and furious and fun as hell, but its cinema of cool may melt down in the coming years, another artifact of reckless, headstrong youth."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"The movie is a little too postured.... Even Baby’s busy backstory threatens to make him a collection of quirky details. But all of that artifice is probably part of the point, best appreciated by generation Ear Bud and its preference for curated experiences."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"Baby Driver doesn’t invite over-thinking. But as visceral, swaggering summer popcorn picture fun, it’s hard to beat. Impossible, as a matter of fact. Forget your comic books and sci-fi sequels. THIS is the movie of the summer."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"Rarely do we see a filmmaker start so strong only to end with a whimper. All in all, though, Baby Driver is still worth seeking out, if only for that first hour. Inside those opening 60 minutes is the best action-comedy of the last ten years — full stop — featuring a breathtaking amalgamation of rip-roaring combat, a star-making performance by Ansel Elgort, and a string of clever bits."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,70,"The good news is that, although Baby Driver is not much of a movie, it is an excellent music video — a club sandwich for the senses, lavishly layered with more than thirty songs."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,70,"Baby Driver’s superb set pieces and unpredictable song selections keep the story humming along, which is crucial since Wright’s plotting isn’t quite as deft."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,70,"Baby Driver proves why we should never doubt Edgar Wright's vision, because few filmmakers can back their ambition with such quality thrills."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,70,"Like all Edgar Wright movies, Baby Driver is a blast, featuring wall-to-wall music and a surfeit of inspired ideas. But it’s also something of a mess, blaring pop tunes of every sort as it lurches between rip-roaring car chases, colorful pre-caper banter, and a twee young-love subplot."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,69,"This movie is all about sensation, about grooving on the very specific but unquestionably catchy hook Wright has laid down for you."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,63,"As charming as Baby Driver strives to be, the appeal starts to curdle once Wright makes his fetishistic aims clear."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,75,"Proves to be more than just a gimmick, and it doesn't skimp on any of the quirky wackiness that you might expect from a film about blob-shaped, flightless birds battling pigs."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,75,"And, make no mistake, this is a movie that is supposed to be seen from the perspective of a small child."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,75,There's no denying the movie's high spirits or its irresistible invitation to shake your sillies out.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,75,"The 3-D animated film delivers a mildly diverting mix of winky meta-jokes and moral lessons, cannily aimed at both the next generation of tiny consumers and their more sophisticated parents."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,70,"The animation punches well above its weight with properly Looney Tunes-standard sight gags, polished, highly expressive character design, and rendering so intensely computed nearly every barbule and rachis on each individual feather is visible."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,70,"A fast, fizzy and frenetically entertaining extension of the manic gaming franchise."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,63,Calling The Angry Birds Movie an “animated film” is giving it airs. It’s a cartoon. Deal with it.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,63,"The Angry Birds Movie is unnecessary but cute, like a bonnet on a cat — and there are certainly worse recommendations than that."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,60,"Screenwriter Jon Vitti and first-time directors Fergal Reilly and Clay Kaytis certainly give it a try, but their bag of tricks is mostly recycled and their sense of humor is aimed squarely at 12-year-old boys."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,50,"Don't get me wrong. Angry Birds doesn't depict any on-camera violence against person, bird, or pig. But there's a darkness at the heart of this movie that's hard to reconcile."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,50,"What starts out as a lowbrow gag very typical of a pedestrian ’toon gradually balloons into absurdity that Mel Brooks would probably love. Here, at least, the Angry Birds fly."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,50,"The Angry Birds Movie is fitfully funny but tends towards a madcap mixture of comedy and action which never develops much forward momentum.  The joke-a-minute approach misses more than it hits, although the bright animation and adorably-rendered characters are decent compensation."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,40,"If Angry Birds fully embraced its message, it could have been a refreshing surprise. But like the mindless video game that inspired it, there’s little here beyond fleeting satisfaction."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,40,"If you loved the game, you might enjoy watching the script contort itself into ever more zany shapes to incorporate the necessary elements: giant slings, teetering towers, boomeranging toucans. But it’s not enough to counteract the tiresome, sub-Lego Movie snarkiness of the script or the bright, busy and unengaging animation."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,38,The Angry Birds Movie isn’t a total turkey. The animation itself is OK and I did laugh out loud once.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,38,Smartphone apps don’t particularly lend themselves well to political allegory or satire. But that’s precisely what the makers of this fitfully amusing animated adaptation of the once-popular game seem to be fruitlessly attempting.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,38,"The Angry Birds Movie is a lot of things, but none of them true to the app's appeal."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,38,"Sudeikis is well-cast as a bird whose “cardinal sin” is cynicism, but he has virtually nothing funny to say."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,37,"It should come as no surprise that The Angry Birds Movie is a loud and dumb children’s film, but for what it’s worth, there are plenty of cinematic commercial ventures that are louder and dumber and so on than the well-meaning and slickly sold Birds."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,33,Perhaps just as disappointing as the haphazard storytelling is the squandering of a top-flight voice ensemble.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,33,"The kids of today deserve better. So do I, come to think of it."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,30,The Angry Birds Movie basically hits all the squares on the Lazily Conceived Family Cartoon bingo card.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,30,"The Angry Birds Movie is simply a pointless swirl of color and motion to babysit small children on home video in a few months. Sadly, such movies aren't an endangered species."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,25,Most of the movie is lazily retrofitted for a variety of marketing opportunities. Some kids will probably like it anyway. But some kids also like toy commercials and singing chipmunks. It doesn’t mean they should actually watch them.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,25,The Angry Birds Movie is just fowl.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,20,"Maybe it’s supposed to be the enlightening tale of one bird’s self-redemption from neurotic negativity, but I just wanted to punch this film in the snout."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,70,"Joel Schumacher, director and ringmaster, piles on the flashy showmanship and keeps the film as big, bold, noisy and mindlessly overwhelming as possible."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,60,"There's something almost maniacally heroic about packaging the fourth sequel of a superhero action series without resorting to the old standbys of good writing, capable acting or inspired directing."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,58,"Unfortunately, the charming Batfamily can't stay in their cave indefinitely; they've got to go out and fight crime. And that's where this elaborately high-style production from Batman Forever director Joel Schumacher hits an iceberg."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,50,"Batman & Robin, like the first three films in the series, is wonderful to look at, and has nothing authentic at its core."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,50,"This film, which places yet another actor in the batsuit, has all the necessary hallmarks of a sorry sequel -- pointless, plodding plotting; asinine action; clueless, comatose characterization; and dumb dialogue."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,50,"It's the lightest of the Batman movies, the most cartoony, the dumbest and the least ambitious. But it holds the audience's attention, brings on a few laughs and never really gets boring."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,50,"George Clooney looks great in a cape, but this fourth installment in the series has invested so much capital in razzle-dazzle special effects that it hardly matters whose head is under the pointy-eared helmet."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,50,"Unfortunately, the operative word is bland, as the newcomers don't add much to the formula, leaving it to their nemeses to enliven the proceedings. Narrative drive and humor are also in short supply, which creates a serious sagsag in the middle when the novelty of the fresh components has mostly worn off."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,40,"There's so much happening in the movie that it feels like nothing is happening at all. Which leaves you free to gaze, slack-jawed, on the true glory of Batman & Robin -- its fabulously color-coded set design."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,40,It's a gee-whiz kiddie movie imagined by pervy grown-ups who get a giggle out of mixing bloodless fight scenes with close-ups of rubber-wrapped butts and baskets.
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,30,"It has none of the minor virtues of Schumacher's other films. It looks bad: cluttered surfaces, production design reminiscent of overblown Broadway musicals, editing too fast for the eye to catch up, poor staging of fast action."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,30,"Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman has written quips, not characters and Joel Schumacher still seems miscast as a Bat-action director: he stages the mayhem confusingly and the comedy too broadly."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,25,Clooney's stiff cornball delivery and tendency to smile during the most tragic moments bring this as close to the cartoonish Batman television series of the 1960s as any of the movies have come.
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,20,"The current Bat cycle was already tired when Schumacher replaced Tim Burton behind the camera on ""Batman Forever."" This chapter -- so action-packed, yet so insufferably dull -- makes it clear that there's nowhere else to go."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,20,"Batman & Robin fails to engage the spirit of Batman, Robin, or decent marketing in general, and instead ends up as a limp, excruciatingly shallow knockoff that leaves viewers cringing at the unavoidable one-liners that make up the better part of the script."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,20,It's clear that writer Akiva Goldsman and director Joel Schumacher are bereft of ideas and using the MTV clutter as a cover-up.
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,20,The fourth installment in the Batman franchise is one long head-splitting exercise in clueless cacophony that makes you feel as though you're being held hostage in some haywire Planet Hollywood while sonic booms pummel your auditory canal.
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,20,"Lacking most kinds of inspiration and geared to undemanding minds, this project is so overloaded with hardware and stunts, it's a relief to have it over."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,10,"Clooney fails to make much of an impression as The Batman, but to make an impression amongst all the garish theatrics, he would pretty much have to shout his dialogue in rhyming verse, backwards."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,10,"Like a wounded yeti, Batman & Robin drags itself through icicle-heavy sets, dry-ice fog and choking jungle vines, before dying in a frozen heap. Unfortunately, that demise occurs about 20 minutes into the movie, which leaves you in the cold for approximately 106 minutes."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,0,"Campy costumes can't disguise the incoherent plot, confused performances and lame script that send this star vehicle spiralling downward."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,80,"And yet, Goldeneye proves the character's viability as a pop icon: It isn't a great movie, but it's great, preposterous fun."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,80,"There's something a mite pathetic about our culture still clinging to 007, but it's hard to deny that this is one of the most entertaining entries in the Bond cycle, which started with ""Dr. No"" (1962)."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,80,"This is the best bond movie since ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service""."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,80,"Most crucially, Brosnan makes the grade as 007. He handles the action capably and gets the standard quips out in a commendably straightforward way that's wry but not dismissive."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,75,"This is the first Bond film that is self-aware, that has lost its innocence and the simplicity of its world view, and has some understanding of the absurdity and sadness of its hero."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,75,"Also, there's more action in Goldeneye than in previous 007 entries -- enough to keep a ninety-minute film moving at a frantic pace. Unfortunately, this movie isn't ninety-minutes long -- it's one-hundred thirty, which means that fully one-quarter of Goldeneye is momentum-killing padding."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,75,"When the action is extreme, GoldenEye is supercharged with spectacular, thundering, brain-numbing fun."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,75,It is both the best-looking James Bond film and the best-looking James Bond.
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,75,"The writers get the mix just about right, and first-time Bond director Martin Campbell moves things along fairly briskly."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,70,"New Bond man Brosnan can't be faulted for much. He's always been generically sexy, a sort of programmed cover boy. In this new venture, he's appropriately handsome, British-accented and suave."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,70,"Jeffrey Caine and Bruce Feirstein's script promises more fun than it delivers, slowly frittering away its store of jokes and thrills."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,63,"Still, just about everything in Goldeneye, from its rote nuclear-weapon-in-space plot to the recitation of lines that sound like they're being read off stone tablets (''Shaken, not stirred!''), has been served up with a thirdhand generic competence that's more wearying than it is exhilarating."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,60,"Mr. Brosnan, as the best-moussed Bond ever to play baccarat in Monte Carlo, makes the character's latest personality transplant viable (not to mention smashingly photogenic), but the series still suffers the blahs."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,58,Technology has squeezed character to a few measly pixels on the digital screens. Explosions have replaced dramatic climaxes.
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,50,"For devotees of the genre, the bad news is the best news: Bond is back and nothing has changed except the stuntman's canvas - it's bigger than ever, duly pumped up to Schwarzeneggarian standards."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,50,"How well do Bond's established conventions survive after a third of a century's hard use, the post-cold war deglamourization of espionage and the arrival of yet another actor in the central role? The short answer is, on wobbly knees."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,88,"Even with the uniformly good performances — and the standout work from Ms. Green — 300: Rise of an Empire is foremost a triumph of production design, costumes, brilliantly choreographed battle sequences and stunning CGI."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,78,"While very much a “hard R” movie, Rise of an Empire is, nevertheless, the perfect sort of film for rainy weekend afternoons. It’s a spectacle right down to its shattered ships and duplicitous warcraft, and this time out the story’s been leavened and enlivened with plenty of old-school girl power."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,75,"300: Rise Of An Empire is a worthy sequel to ""300,"" stylistically consistent and equally loony, featuring what may well be the first truly can't-miss performance in a film this year."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,75,"The film belongs to Green — maybe the only actress ever to ""graduate"" from being a Bertolucci muse to a bloodthirsty action-flick dominatrix."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,70,"Rise of an Empire might have been essentially more of the same, but for one distinction that makes it 300 times better than its predecessor: Mere mortals of Athens, Sparta, and every city from Mumbai to Minneapolis, behold the magnificent Eva Green, and tremble!"
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,70,"Anchored by Eva Green’s fearsome performance as a Persian naval commander whose vengeful bloodlust makes glowering King Xerxes seem a mere poseur, this highly entertaining time-filler lacks the mythic resonances that made “300” feel like an instant classic, but works surprisingly well on its own terms."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,Israeli director Noam Murro does an excellent job of managing and expanding the franchise established so vividly by Zach Snyder.
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,"Entirely more engaging by dint of being absolutely impossible to take even a little bit seriously. The ruthlessness of Green's character is taken to extremes that meld Medea to the cheesiest serial you can name, and is hence delicious."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,The lack of a creative driver behind the film leads to a level of fundamental dissatisfaction. The movie delivers all the necessary elements but their impact is dull.
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,This is digital fake-ism all the way. Audiences bought it the first time; they're likely to buy it a second time.
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,"Green rules the picture with her nutty stare and her willingness to get nasty in a hot sex scene, but the movie’s main weak point is the Greek general Themistokles."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,"The design... is stunning, an improvement over 2006′s “300.” And the action never disappoints. It’s a pity this colorless cast doesn’t hold a candle to the Butler/Headey/Michael Fassbender/David Wenham crew of the original, that the writers couldn’t conjure up thrilling speeches to match the original."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,60,"For all the energetic milling, Rise of an Empire proves superior to its predecessor by making war a game both sexes can play, on nearly equal terms. In comparison, the R-rated ""300"" seems as innocent as Adam in the Garden before the delicious complication of Eve — or Eva."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,60,"The spectacularly brutal fighting is the film's main calling card, and in that ""Rise of an Empire"" doesn't disappoint. Still, in the battle for best guilty pleasure, I'd give it to the Spartans of ""300,"" by a head."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,60,"If 300’s human touch largely came down to Butler’s roaring and screaming, it’s left entirely to Green to goose the sequel into life. Happily she obliges."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,60,"Just as bloody yet much more conventional, 300 #2 offers splashy thrills aplenty but fails to make a watertight case for its own existence. Green, however, ensures it stays afloat."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,60,"It’s all extravagantly daft, moves at a fair clip and is over before you expect it to be."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,50,The best thing about the new 300: Rise of an Empire is that Zack Snyder didn’t direct it. And the worst thing about it is that Zack Snyder didn’t direct it.
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,50,Stunningly shot and stupidly written.
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,50,The naval collisions and melees play out in panel-like renderings that are bold and satisfying for the first half-hour but lack the momentum and bombastic je ne sais quoi of “300.”
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,50,"Basically, if the first “300” was a pep-talk from Coach on how to lose with dignity, Rise of an Empire is an inspirational speech on the value of teamwork."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,50,"Other than for the pleasure of watching Green try to conquer ancient Greece dressed as a distant forebearer of Catwoman, more is less and a little late in this long-aborning sequel."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,40,"It really is pretty dull, though, with the same moments of campy silliness: the same frowning gym bunnies with the same digitally enhanced abs."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,40,"The best thing about the movie, by far, is Green. Her Artemisia is a real nut case with a taste for blood, and Green is the only one in the cast who seems to be having any fun at all."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,40,"The film feels epic in scope, visually at least, but the depth of its deep-focus composition is bitterly at odds with the flimsiness of its characterization and plotting."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,38,"By throwing herself headfirst into scenes that a more cautious actress might beg off, Green earns herself a citation for valour – a Purple Heart in a movie that’s otherwise way too grim and grey for its own good."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,33,"Forgettable and only mildly entertaining, 300: Rise of An Empire seals its own fate at the initial story level by being so deeply invested in its own mythmaking and playing super safe."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,25,"Both a prequel and a sequel to the original tale, only with more bloodspilling and slow-motion, and even less wit or truth."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,25,"When the film isn’t sloppily directed, it’s a series of lazy filmmaking tics, including fetishistic slow-motion shots of blood, water and sweat, as well as sundry dismemberments, impalings and decapitations."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,25,"""300"" was an innovative and imaginative action film, but the follow-up, 300: Rise of an Empire, is nothing but a disappointment."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,25,"Noam Murro gives the film nothing so much as a hit-refresh on the same glistening, impossibly golden and gray flecks of pixel-barf that have invaded the frames of every tent-pole studio release since the Bush administration."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,25,"Murro doesn’t so much direct as frame and stage, placing the characters against digital desktop-wallpaper skies and constructing each battle scene as a showcase for the characters’ prowess and toughness."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,20,"The only saving grace is Green, the reigning witch-queen of cinema. The smoky-eyed French actress, best known for “Casino Royale,” “The Golden Compass” and “Dark Shadows,” throws her all into the performance, going bare-chested at times, bared-teeth at others. She’s like Elizabeth Taylor’s ""Cleopatra"" possessed by a succubus — which is a good thing. Without her, 300: Rise of an Empire would be bloodless and brainless."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,0,The empty violence and pointless style are only the biggest problems.
The Italian Job,7,106128601,90,"The chase scenes in The Italian Job are the most exciting ones I can remember seeing in a movie in a long time, probably because they're the only ones I can remember -- and that's saying something."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,90,"A fast and furious action-adventure. The film's comedy counts for as much as the clever and risky ways in which Wahlberg and company go after the nasty Norton, who has holed up in a Bel-Air mansion with a world-class security system."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,90,"Less giddy and more cohesive than the original, the film doesn't waste time, plunging almost directly into a spectacular heist."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,80,"An elaborate techno-heist thriller, The Italian Job features some spectacular chase scenes, but for a change, the people doing the chasing are also worth watching."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,80,"Not only are the action sequences well-paced and witty, but Gray neatly draws out the comic high spirits in Wahlberg's ensemble of crooks."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,80,The forthcoming line of high-octane summer entertainments will be hard-pressed to top this one for both thrills and wit.
The Italian Job,7,106128601,80,"A pandering, debased, generic little nothing of a movie. And I'm still trying to figure out why I loved it so inordinately."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,80,"For two hours, the bliss of the brainless fluff is yours for the asking. It cheerfully puts the escape back in escapism."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,80,"It's more like the déjà vu machine. But that does not negate this movie's copious pleasures, chief among them its prudent decision to act like it's never supposed to be more than good time, a thrilling test-drive in a car you love but can't afford to actually buy."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,80,"It is, as with any cinematic joy ride, not the destination that matters, but the rush of getting there."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,80,"A zippy, energetic, automotive free-for-all, a caper extravaganza minus the bleak overtones that have come to figure in so many 9mm movies these days."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,78,"This is pure entertainment but smart entertainment, plotted and executed with invention and humor and acted by a winning cast radiating good-movie energy."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,75,"Norton is unapologetic and unflappable in his part. Slimy and vaguely nerdy, he's become the thinking man's thug, even if this character's Armani-wear is better tailored than his psychology."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,75,"The Italian Job isn't a masterpiece, but it gets the job done."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,75,"Sometimes, when you least expect it, Hollywood is so Hollywood good, serving up a flick guaranteed to answer the clarion call of the multitudes. ""I just want to be entertained,"" you say? Well, fork out then, because The Italian Job does the job."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,75,"Zooms along with confidence, smarts, and some of the coolest car chases this side of the Indy 500."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,75,"It's an entertaining picture, classy and well executed, but as much as any film I've seen recently, this lush new version of the 1969 Michael Caine thriller tends to prove that, where thrillers are concerned, ""more"" is often less."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,75,"Fits squarely into the ""exciting"" category; it's a white-knuckler of the first order."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,75,This is just the movie for two hours of mindless escapism on a relatively skilled professional level.
The Italian Job,7,106128601,75,"Feels a like smooth, exciting whoosh down a ski slope."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,70,"Satisfying in a purely infantile way, and the familiarity of everything is oddly comforting. In terms of action, moreover, this makes ""The Matrix Reloaded"" look like a clodhopper's jamboree."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,70,"Charlize Theron, playing the one woman member of the team, handily steals the movie from the guys with her no-nonsense display of verve and vulnerability."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,70,"Manages to be a solid, though not exceptional, heist movie with a good-looking cast and -- maybe -- even better-looking cars."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,67,"There's a fair amount of filler in The Italian Job, but it all boils down to the big heist, which has been staged as if it were Fort Knox being robbed by Evel Knievel."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,67,"Essentially an old-fashioned movie, nothing fancy, nothing new, just some jokes and some action and a crowd-pleasing finale."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,67,"A slicker, faster-paced, high-tech upgrade that lifts the sprightly spirit and the main action set piece from the original while developing its own twists and a new ending that, though a bit too pat and eager to please, is a vast improvement."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,63,"Heist movies seem pretty quaint and analog in our era where high stakes crime is primarily electronic in nature. But until someone can make embezzlement cinematically interesting, were left with theft and this movie just gets away with it."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,63,"Even if it weren't a remake, The Italian Job would still look startlingly unoriginal, but in a summer that promises plenty of sold-out showings, it could be the season's breakout pretty-okay-second-choice film."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,60,"Zesty in a workmanlike sort of way, providing supporting henchmen Jason Statham and Mos Def with pleasingly unsensational characters given to subtle twitches of idiosyncrasy."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,60,There are popcorn pictures and there are microwave popcorn pictures. The Italian Job is best saved for the living room.
The Italian Job,7,106128601,50,"This version moves like a freight train, but suffers from a debilitating charm deficit. Wahlberg is no Michael Caine and Norton delivers what must be the sourest, most lifeless performance of his career to date."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,50,"Watching The Italian Job in a theater makes you long for a fast-forward button - to skip past 90 eyeball-glazing minutes of generic caper plotting and cut to the chase, as it were."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,50,"Do yourself a favor and resist The Italian Job, a lazy and in-name-only remake of 1969's G-rated Michael Caine heist pic."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,50,"After concocting one tense crime at the beginning, the writers can't do any better than to imitate it later."
The Italian Job,7,106128601,50,"A triumph for the machines, more proof that we do indeed live in the Matrix."
Every Which Way but Loose,6.3,106000000,60,"Clint doing roughneck humour with an orang-utan, what's not to like?"
Every Which Way but Loose,6.3,106000000,60,"For Eastwood fans, the essential elements are there. Lots of people get beat up, Eastwood walks tall and looks nasty, cars are crashed. James Fargo directs limply."
Every Which Way but Loose,6.3,106000000,50,"A huge disappointment after The Outlaw Josey Wales and The Gauntlet, this rambling comedy forsakes the subtle, self-deprecating humour of those films and opts for a far rowdier and broader comedy that never really goes anywhere or says anything."
Every Which Way but Loose,6.3,106000000,50,"There's no accounting for the success of this over the failure of Eastwood's infinitely superior Bronco Billy. The year 1978 was the year of heavy pictures, with The Deer Hunter, Coming Home, and Midnight Express. Perhaps people just wanted to sit back, eat some popcorn, and have a good old evening of cheer and laughter."
Every Which Way but Loose,6.3,106000000,50,"The slackest and most harebrained of Mr. Eastwood's recent movies. It is overlong and virtually uneventful, even though there are half a dozen cute characters and woolly subplots competing for the viewer's attentions."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,75,"The movie flies by pleasantly, and is then instantly forgettable. Perhaps Jules Verne can explain the science of that."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,63,"The second installment in a likable family franchise, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island makes a nice case to your kids that reading books is a good idea."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,63,"It's a thoroughly family-friendly film, with a subtle message about the importance of father figures. Don't expect anything resembling believability, but enjoy the blend of strikingly colorful visuals and banter between odd couple Johnson and Caine, which combine for a mild escapist treat."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,63,"Yes, The Mysterious Island is everything a 12-year-old boy could want – endless adventure involving a reckless adolescent hero, with a pretty girl in a clinging T-shirt around to watch him struggle."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,63,"This is transcendently goofy. It isn't a ""good"" movie in the usual sense (or most senses), but it is jolly and good-natured, and Michael Caine and Dwayne Johnson are among the most likable of actors."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,60,"If there's a book-loving adventuress or adventurer in your house younger than 10, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island provides a lighthearted break from the death-obsessed ""Harry Potter"" franchise and other literary but limp adventures like the ""Narnia"" films and ""The Lightning Thief."""
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,60,A fun though rarely funny family adventure whose lively special effects compensate somewhat for actors who largely sleepwalk through their roles.
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,60,"Massively throwaway, but funnier and more likable than the first entry. Mainly that's due to an A-list pairing that's as inspired as it is demented."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,50,"For all the special effects – like its predecessor, this is in 3-D – the film coasts on Johnson being charming and Caine being Caine."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,50,"With cheesy-looking effects including a ride on the backs of giant bees and dubious literary references, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island comes dangerously close to giving books, never mind 3-D, a bad name."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,50,"This kind of movie is all about the special effects. They start out great - cool helicopter crash, very convincing giant lizard - but grow more amateurish as the film goes along, with a flight sequence on giant bees proving particularly clunky."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,50,"Surrogate fathers and family values are at the foreground, making the film a quick sell to parents - especially as it boasts the added value of literary roots."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,50,"This is a family movie, after all -- but you'll have to sit through some abrasively broad, unfunny exchanges to get there. Dialogue, alas, is the kind of thing that can't be enhanced by the wearing of 3-D glasses."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,50,"The look of the film is impressive, as are the effects. Overall, however, it's a big, loud, 3-D-drenched jumble."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,50,"As the band of adventurers skips from one supersized Survivor-like challenge to the next, one can't help feeling the creative potential of Verne's vision is wasted."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,40,"The island locale rings with reggae music regardless of its proximity to Jamaica, and any action sequence is rendered in painfully deliberate slo-mo."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,40,"Even ""Bwana Devil"" showed less crassness in its attempts to wow, however, and the more this cardboard blockbuster piles on the cut-rate F/X, the less anyone - the cast, the filmmaker, you - can muster up the energy to care."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,40,"It's silly enough that young teens are unlikely to be drawn to it unless they've got a thing for Hudgens or want to take an early peek at Hutcherson, who will soon be seen as Peeta in ""The Hunger Games."" He was great as a sulky brat in ""The Kids Are All Right"" but in Journey 2 he comes across as wooden, dull and though not yet 20, too old for roles like these."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,40,"The film is endurable owing solely to Johnson, a veteran of bad kids' movies whose sense of when to dial up the charm in such a generic, soulless entertainment remains impeccable."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,38,Anyone old enough to have read Jules Verne or seen the way his work was successfully adapted in the past will suffer worse than the kids in the audience who just came to laugh.
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,38,"Even by the unambitious standards of some children's movies and many movies that star Caine, this one has a difficult time making a case for itself as anything other than an adventure in baby-sitting."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,38,"Hutcherson spits his lines out as quickly as possible, which you appreciate, because the way the likable Johnson wrestles with his lines (""It looks like the liquefaction has tripled overnight!"") you think, well, it's a living."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,33,"This adventure strands Johnson's famously animated features in eyebrow jail, and squanders his outsized charisma and gift for winking self-deprecation in a thankless worried-stepfather role. It doesn't call for much, beyond a lot of muscles and an ever-present look of concern for his whiny stepson."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,30,The result is a goofy-weird mishmash of some pretty swell CGI creatures and some downright lousy screenwriting.
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,25,"For a time, Journey 2 becomes a lost episode of ""Lost,"" then it becomes ""King Kong,"" minus the ape. Then it becomes a ukulele music video featuring the Rock's take on Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's ""What a Wonderful World."""
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,25,"Prizes computer-generated wizardry above logical plotting or thoughtful character development, a misguided set of priorities exacerbated by the fact that said digital effects prove so chintzy."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,0,The movie's flexibility with its own rules would be less noticeable if it were busy thrilling us.
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,88,"The shaggy, whimsical characters have a primal familiarity, as though they were developed by a tag team of Maurice Sendak and Walt Disney."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,80,"It's gorgeously designed, deftly written and frequently laugh-out-loud funny. For child or adult, this is a fantasy to get lost in."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,80,"It's a grand, colorful adventure, an escapist romp draped in tinsel. And, who knows -- if you're all good little boys and girls this year, perhaps it will also be the first installment in a new DreamWorks holiday tradition."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,80,"One of the best kid's films of the year, full of delight and action and charm and comedy."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,75,"The Guardians make a winning team that is a prime candidate for a sequel, just like ""The Avengers."""
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,75,A satisfying holiday treat for adults and children alike.
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,75,"While Rise Of The Guardians boasts a great deal of visual energy and amounts to a lot of fun, it's mostly lacking in that kind of depth elsewhere."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,75,"There's an audience for this film. It's not me. I gather younger children will like the breakneck action, the magical ability to fly and the young hero who has tired of only being a name. Their parents and older siblings may find the 89-minute running time quite long enough."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,75,"Thoughts become things. That's the message of Rise of the Guardians, a charming if slightly dark and cobwebbed animated feature about how believing in something makes it real, or real enough."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,75,Rise of the Guardians is an all-star addition to holiday movies lists but the real question is: Which holiday?
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,75,Rise of the Guardians is enjoyable as a stand-alone adventure - not groundbreaking animation but a solidly entertaining 90 minutes for older children and adults.
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,70,"As much as its premise may sound like the start of a bad joke, Peter Ramsey's movie preserves just enough genuine childhood wonder in its whooshing, high-tech theatrics to make it a delight."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,70,Works so hard at celebrating wide eyes and naïve joy that it comes close to spoiling its own intermittent wonderfulness.
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,70,"At times, it approaches some of Pixar's best."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,67,It's all more lightweight-likable than exciting.
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,63,"This does seem to leave room for bigger, bolder, more momentous adventures down the line."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,63,"With its fanciful razzle-dazzle, Rise of the Guardians is appealing, if slightly hectic, family fare."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,63,This spirited enough yarn is sincere and heartening in its belief that our devotion to these youthful myths is healthy for our sense of wonderment.
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,60,"More ""oooh… aaah"" than ""ho-ho-ho"", ROTG is so full of yuletide razzmatazz that only true Scrooges will have trouble stomaching it. If only Santa's workshop had given the script more of a tinker..."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,60,"Rise of the Guardians is adapted from Joyce's book series The Guardians of Childhood. But the occasional Joycean touch aside, it bears so little resemblance to the look and feel of its source material that it ought to be considered an entirely different beast."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,60,"There is a lot to savor in Rise of the Guardians, but sometimes too much of a good thing can be exhausting."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,60,"It has a great voice cast, a kinda-sorta interesting premise and the 3-D is effective, but somehow it just doesn't add up."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,60,"If Rise of the Guardians is finally never more than the sum of its parts, the parts themselves have real appeal."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,60,"The characters and settings are attractively designed, and the vocal performances have real color and a sense of fun that gently undercuts the treacly sincerity of certain obligatory kid-pandering moments."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,58,"Too much of this movie, directed by Peter Ramsey, is more clamorous than inspired, and little kids might find parts of it too scarily intense."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,50,"The movie lacks a resonant center. The script seems to have been written by committee, with members lobbying for each major character, and the action, set in vast environments all over the map, spreads itself so thin that a surfeit of motion vitiates emotion."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,50,"Like most children's movies, Rise of the Guardians mimics the patterns of adult entertainment. Where is the magic in that?"
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,50,"From time to time, as Alexandre Desplat's insistent score surged yet again while the characters rushed by, I found myself wanting the movie to slow down. Some of these images are too beautiful to disappear so quickly."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,50,"Innocence and joy are threatened by the Boogeyman, and from there the plot comes pretty close to mirroring this summer's ""The Avengers"" movie. Mostly in a good way."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,50,"Even tots may emerge feeling slightly browbeaten by this colorful, strenuous and hyperactive fantasy, which has moments of charm and beauty but often resembles an exploding toy factory rather than a work of honest enchantment."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,40,"Dour animated adventure that aspires to holiday joy, but is as enjoyable as a sock full of coal."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,40,"The voice work sounds more quick-paycheck than impassioned, and the animation rarely rises above video-game cut-scene quality. As revisionist holiday fables go, you're better off watching Aardman's delightful ""Arthur Christmas"" than this lump of coal."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,30,"Kids who can stomach mixed holiday fare should be able to ride out this stereoscopic superstorm of snowglobes, Easter eggs, magic portals, enchanted crystals, moon worship, fruitcakes, matryoshka dolls, and lost teeth. Others may be confused."
Rise of the Guardians,7.3,103412758,12,"I can't remember ever seeing such a spectacular implosion of a squad of all-stars as Rise of the Guardians. Well, not since Yankee Stadium in October."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,80,"As spectacular as you’d hope from a sequel to the 1996 planet-toaster, and as amusingly cheesy. You’ll enjoy yourself enough that you won’t even miss Will Smith."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,70,"Resurgence doles out the action and effects work in carefully calculated, incremental doses, which give the film a cumulative tension. Even if it’s hokey and jokey, this is a loud, effects-driven piece, with a driving score. For fans of Roland Emmerich disaster movies, this both hits all the marks, while delivering nothing new."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,60,Both impossible to take seriously or seriously dislike.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,60,"The main thing consumers will be looking for from Resurgence is bang-for-buck entertainment, and that it delivers reasonably successfully."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,60,This cinematic Big Mac entertains abundantly on its own second-hand merits.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,60,"It’s all too much too fast, and the cumulative effect is like watching a two-hour trailer – more dizzying than thrilling."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,58,Resurgence ends up falling victim to its attempts to differentiate itself while remaining completely derivative.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,58,"Despite all this, Independence Day: Resurgence still emerges as one of the better blockbusters of this summer, and that’s only halfway damning with faint praise. It’s a mess, but I grinned a good portion of the way through."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,55,"The spaceships and the destruction are bigger but not better in Roland Emmerich‘s twenty-years-later follow-up, where only Jeff Goldblum‘s sense of humor saves the day."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,50,"No surprise, then, that Goldblum seems a little lonely and marooned in the latest venture, which suffers from a nagging case of Smithlessness."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,50,Tarnishes the image of its predecessor but the original Independence Day wasn’t all that good to begin with.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,50,"The disaster sequences themselves — of which there are many, placed at regular intervals but disconnected from the story, like operatic arias — have a dreamlike and weirdly exhilarating quality that’s quite different from the plodding wham-bam destruction of the average action blockbuster."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,50,"While the plot is dumb and the script is worse, watching aliens explode in spectacular fashion isn't the worst excuse to spend to two hours in air-conditioning."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,42,Fails both as a film and even as fan service.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,40,Lacks both the iconic heft of its predecessor's imagery as well as any sense of character development.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,40,"Goldblum manages to rise above the proceedings via his invisible jetpack of dry wit — thank God for that. The only newcomer who emerges unscathed is Gainsbourg, who glides through this mess with Zen equanimity—even as chaos reigns, she keeps her cool."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,40,Laughably bad dialogue and wooden acting.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,40,"This isn’t just lazy, it’s borderline nonsensical. Resurgence inflates the scale of the alien threat to such a preposterous degree – the mothership takes up roughly an eighth of the Earth’s total surface – that the queues of honking traffic and rooftop helicopter rescues we’re supposed to invest in can’t help but feel like microscopic trifles."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,40,"This might have been titled ‘Independence Day: Submergence’. It’s certainly hard not to drown in the sea of CGI, with the exponential increase of pixels being to Independence Day what the Star Wars prequels were to the original trilogy."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,"The movie must be bad, right? Worse, it’s a bore."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,This is a disaster by committee.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,"It’s just dull and hollow — a massive waste of time and money. The characters are flimsy, the dialogue is stilted and the amount of destruction is ridiculous."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,"Independence Day: Resurgence pretends there's fresh ground to cover. There isn't, but director Roland Emmerich makes a good show of faking it."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,"Independence Day: Resurgence is all big effects, big explosions, epic battles rendered in state-of-the-art strokes. But really bad writing, achingly bad acting, groaning scenes and a serious lack of suspense and surprise all add up to zero fun, this time around."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,Ridiculousness needs to abound somewhat in a film like this — reality takes a seat early and often here — but Resurgence pushes everything to an egregiously over-the-top and often infuriating degree.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,33,"There’s no heart in this movie, no urgency."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,30,"Honestly, I could watch Goldblum and Gainsbourg – two of the most quirkily sublime multihypenate artists alive – reading phonebooks to each other and enjoy the experience thoroughly, but sadly even they seem wasted here."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,30,"The lackluster, at times abysmal writing wouldn’t much matter if Resurgence popped visually or featured a charismatic star who could lift a movie as effortlessly as Will Smith did in the first feature."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,30,"While the first ""Independence Day"" was genuinely big, dumb fun, its sequel only manages to be a bigger, dumber bore."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,30,"Independence Day: Resurgence is a bad movie, occasionally in ways that are good for a chuckle, like when people earnestly deliver lines like “Now listen up! They’re going for our molten core!” but mostly just bad in ways that make you wish you hadn’t wasted your money or your time."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,25,A curiously loud and ugly beast of a sequel.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,25,"The sequel is even more silly, and much less fun."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,25,"I saw Resurgence an hour and a half ago, and I feel like an alien wiped my memory clean already."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,25,"The first “Independence Day’’ was a lot of fun, with a great lines and cutting-edge special effects. It was much imitated, so the sequel plays like a faded, eighth-generation copy with a cast that’s shooting blanks when it comes to humor."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,20,This hodgepodge has been thrown together in so slovenly a way that it’s no surprise the studio didn’t show it to the press.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,20,"Joyless and tedious, a reboot quite without the first film’s audacity and fun... It’s a movie that is going through the intergalactic motions."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,16,An immaculate case-study in how far blockbusters have fallen.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,0,"One of the most aggressively stupid blockbusters ever made, a painful exercise in Hollywood greed and artistic incompetence on every level."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,0,Disposable and shockingly inept.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,0,"Emmerich rewards our patience with an impersonally massive set piece involving the usual generic stew of mass CGI-imagined demolition. The insensitivity displayed toward human life in these sequences would be galling even by Emmerich's standards, if this pitiful albatross of corporate capitalism could work up enough energy to be offensive."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,75,Expendables is the closest thing to movie Viagra yet invented. It's reprehensible. It's stoopid violent. It's a lot of unholy fun.
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,75,"The way that Stallone directs, though, every machete thrust and relentless round of bullet spray is staged with a certain undeniable...conviction."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,75,"Delivers pretty much exactly what its audience wants and expects: big, dumb, campy fun so deliriously, comically macho, it's remarkable that no one in the cast died of testosterone poisoning."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,70,"An effective mix of lean and over-the-top, The Expendables is often preposterous, but it achieves the immediacy of a graphic novel without the overdone mythology."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,70,"The three icons ham it up, do some verbal towel-snapping and have fun, which also describes most of this self-conscious adventure movie."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,63,A super-stoked action thriller
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,60,"A who's who of classic action stars light up the screen for pure combustible entertainment in Sly Stallone's The Expendables, a sort of ""Dirty Dozen"" meets ""Inglourious Basterds""--and then some."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,60,"If you want to see old-fashioned nonstop mayhem with stars so venerable that ""The Leathernecks"" (and I don't mean Marines) might be an alternative title, reviews are going to be superfluous. If you don't want to go, no review can change your mind."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,60,"This is action as timeless as the reptilian brain-and if The Expendables is no classic, for about 20 minutes, it blowed up real good."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,60,"More The Wild Geese than The Wild Bunch, The Expendables is not a wasted opportunity, but more one not fully exploited."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"If anyone gets a career boost from The Expendables it will be Dolph Lundgren, playing a drug-addicted loose Howitzer booted from the team and flipping to the bad side."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"The trailers already have given away the ""surprise"" cameos in The Expendables, so try not to blink when Stallone goes into a church (shades of John Woo) to meet his mystery boss, played by a bald-pated, trademark smirking Bruce Willis."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"What you will find is both familiar in its contours and unique in its casting: the definitive alterkocker action picture. Call it ""The Old Dogs of War,"" or ""Incontinent Basterds."""
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"Next to the hopelessly inexpressive Stallone and the English-impaired Li, Statham emerges as the movie's principal wit. But the script furnishes him with only a few deadpan quips. Besides, it's no great accomplishment to be the funniest guy in a Sylvester Stallone flick."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"Still, what makes Sly's new film fascinating is that, 35 years after he created and starred in the ultimate little-boy fantasy, ""Rocky,"" Stallone remains such a guileless, big-dreaming innocent."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"The Expendables feels, well -- disposable, a movie whose nostalgia  isn't enough to make this 50. caliber trip down Memory Lane worth the fake napalm."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"And give credit to Stallone: He just leaves the camera on Rourke, in the tightest of close-ups, cutting only once, to himself, for a one-second reaction shot, but keeping the focus on his actor. A great actor."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"I love a good, brainless action flick as much as the next alpha male, but this time I had a whole lot of trouble laughing along."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"In the final analysis, The Expendables is little more than an ordinary, uninspired action feature."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"At one point Rourke delivers a monologue about his time in Bosnia, and the conviction the actor brings to the occasion throws the movie completely out of whack. What's actual acting doing in a movie like this?"
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"Stallone directs a bloodbath that borrows liberally from such male-bonding classics as Robert Aldrich's ""The Dirty Dozen"" and Sam Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch,"" but offers not a whiff of the tragic fatalism and astute critique of machismo that inform those superior dramas."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,42,"The opening action sequence, unrelated to the main story, is nicely done, but after that it's all downhill."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,42,"Brainless, witless, inept, ugly and crude,"
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,40,"A nearly incoherent all-stars-on-deck actioner that plays like ""Grown Ups"" on nitro or a brutish, blue-collar ""Ocean's Eleven."""
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,40,"Might more aptly be described as Bad Kurosawa, Bad Peckinpah or Bad Leone. Which might be a way of saying that it's better-than-average Stallone. I can't quite say that it's not bad: it is bad! But not entirely in a bad way."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,40,The thought behind this body-splattering nostalgia trip is unformed and stagnant.
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,40,"You see this cast, you expect to see a lot of violent action. And in that regard, The Expendables delivers, and then some. In this case, then, the old saying applies: Be careful what you ask for, you just might get it."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,40,"It's big, it's loud, it's dumb, and all things considered, it's not completely un-fun."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,38,"So why oh why is The Expendables such a limp-dick bust? Because Stallone forgets to include non-spazzy direction, a coherent plot, dialogue that actors can speak without cringing, stunts that don't fizzle, blood that isn't digital and an animating spirit that might convince us to give a damn."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,38,Sadistic mess of a movie.
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,38,"Incoherent, inept, testosterone-drenched mess, which is very much the brain-dead male equivalent of ""Sex and the City 2."""
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,38,Jason Statham gives the best performance. Dolph Lundgren gets the best character arc. Terry Crews gets the best gun. Jet Li gets the best kill (you'll know it when you see it).Arnold Schwarzenegger gets the best cameo. And Sylvester Stallone? He gets the blame.
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,30,The whole exercise has the trying-too-hard vibe of a bad toupee.
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,12,"There's never any real danger in the movie, which makes The Expendables feel like one of those chummy Rat Pack flicks that were just excuses for a bunch of pals to get together and goof off."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,10,"The Expendables is savage yet inert, and breathtakingly sleazy in its lack of imagination."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,88,"Beyond the visuals, what makes The Maze Runner so compelling is its attention-grabbing storyline."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,78,"Even if it doesn’t manage to be quite the ""Hunger Games""-level hit its producers would clearly desire, it’s the best of the wannabes we’ve seen so far."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,75,"Director Wes Ball makes a solid feature film debut, without any noticeable video game envy to his action sequences."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,75,"Using a refreshingly gentle FX touch, Ball has successfully transposed the decaying, vine-covered concrete jungle look of his short onto this gorgeously-designed feature. The neophyte knows how to direct heart-pumping chase scenes and has coaxed surprisingly solid performances from his young ensemble cast, especially O’Brien and Poulter."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,75,"Director Wes Ball doesn't have much experience with actors, but for once that's a plus; his background is in animation and art direction, and the design of the maze (brutal slabs of concrete and steel) and the attacks by the spiders (""Predator""-like clicks, then stabbing violence) make the movie gruesomely watchable."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,75,"As incomplete as the narrative is, The Maze Runner delivers on almost every other level."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,75,First-time feature director Wes Ball's version of The Maze Runner makes the cliches smell daisy-fresh.
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,75,"If you’re going to treat your audience like a rat in a maze, it’s best to offer a tastier reward than the promise of more maze to come."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,75,"Wes Ball's background is in animation and effects, and he certainly has an eye for composition. Thankfully, he doesn't just lean on visual flash in his debut feature, the adaptation of the first of James Dashner's four books, and his skills allow him to build a convincing world around his appealing cast without losing them in it completely."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,72,"For a genre that so often sacrifices character development and smaller narrative developments, the majority of The Maze Runner feels quite refreshing and worth the navigation."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,70,"The Maze Runner only answers some of the questions it so marvelously sets up. And while I probably now know too much about the story for it to work a similar magic next time, I find myself genuinely anticipating the next one."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,67,"The first two-thirds of The Maze Runner are a clever feat of fantasy world building. It's thrilling, twisty, and as mysterious as the mammoth Skinner Box environment the film takes place in. But the promising set-up raises so many puzzle-piece questions that when it's all finally explained in the final reel, you can't help feeling a bit gypped."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,63,"It's bleak business, and as it hurries toward its explosive, expository conclusion, the film becomes nonsensical, too."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,63,"What’s intriguing about The Maze Runner – for a long time, at least – is the way it tells us a story we think we’ve heard countless times before but with a refreshingly different tone and degree of detail."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,63,"A curious blend of our newly acquired taste for dystopia alongside a healthy sprinkling of Lord of the Flies, the film offers familiar pleasures without prompting the sense of having already been here before."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,60,"Entertaining but never quite thrilling, this actually feels like the second film in a franchise, coasting along, but saving the best bits for the next episode."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,60,"It’s a well-made adventure with great energy and considerable style, but it’s essentially a maze without an exit."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,60,It's also both intense and entertaining enough to leave audiences hungry for the inevitable sequel so clearly set up by its cliffhanger ending.
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,60,"No, there’s nothing new here. But sometimes it’s enough to be merely entertained, rather than amazed."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,60,"By establishing some of the Glade’s castes, rituals, and personalities, the writers make an incredibly contrived scenario seem a little more tangible. But once that high gear is engaged, the IQ and ambition drop precipitously."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,60,"Aside from some uneven handling of the cast, Ball competently styles the action sequences throughout the film and capitalizes on his VFX expertise with pulse-pounding scenes tracking the Runners through the Maze battling Grievers."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,60,"As world-creation YA pictures go, The Maze Runner feels refreshingly low-tech and properly story-driven."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,55,"For its first half or so, The Maze Runner tells a captivating tale of survival and weaves a potentially interesting mystery. Once its path become clear, however, you realize this is a puzzle you've worked out before."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,50,"Despite a strong opening and riveting first 45 minutes, The Maze Runner devolves into one of the weakest post-apocalyptic Young Adult movies to reach theaters in recent years."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,50,"The Maze Runner isn’t based on a video game, but you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise. In it, our hero must lead his comrades through a dingy gray concrete maze while dodging cyborg monsters, and it all looks like every gaming trailer you’ve ever seen."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,50,"Ball tends to slice and dice action sequences in a way that drains them of energy, and his attempts to churn up emotion fall disconcertingly flat. But he does stage a couple of effective adrenaline-pumping chases through the maze's industrial wasteland."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,50,A perfectly serviceable entry in the young-adult dystopian sweepstakes.
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,50,Maze Runner feels only partially formed.
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,50,"Think “Lord of the Flies,” without all the jerks."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,40,The Maze Runner is so bleak that it almost convinces us to take it seriously.
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,40,"The look of the film is impressive enough, but the performances are merely OK. The same goes for the story."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,40,"The Maze Runner is not a good movie, but it wins points for omitting much of what makes typical teen films excruciating."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,38,"The resolution to this puzzle is so botched it’s insulting, as if they’re daring us to laugh at the notion that this is merely “the beginning.”"
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,25,"Fans of the novel might get some minor thrills from the big screen adaptation, but it's hard to understand what made the material so popular in the first place."
In the Line of Fire,7.2,102314283,100,"It's movie making of the high, smooth, commercial order that Hollywood prides itself on but achieves with singular infrequency."
In the Line of Fire,7.2,102314283,88,"The director is Wolfgang Petersen (""Das Boot""), who is able to unwind the plot like clockwork while at the same time establishing the characters as surprisingly sympathetic."
In the Line of Fire,7.2,102314283,88,"The result is a finely tuned suspense thriller, though executives who have recently laid off trained killers may experience some discomfort."
In the Line of Fire,7.2,102314283,80,"It's not the deepest thematic concern you ever saw on screen. But it's watchable, great fun."
In the Line of Fire,7.2,102314283,80,"Both Eastwood's performance and the movie itself have the quality of meat-and-potatoes genre-picture entertainment: nothing fancy, nothing unusual."
In the Line of Fire,7.2,102314283,80,"What neophyte scripterscripter Jeff Maguire's plot comes down to, however, is the cat-and-mouse game between Horrigan and Leary, and the craftiness and strategies involved on both sides, while not exactly ingenious, are tantalizing enough to compel interest."
In the Line of Fire,7.2,102314283,80,"In the Line of Fire is a terrific action movie with good performances and a smart script that occasionally falters for trying too hard but, on the whole, takes us on psychological journeys that few of us have had opportunities to experience."
In the Line of Fire,7.2,102314283,78,"Petersen takes what could have been a muddled motion picture and structures it perfectly, creating a strong piece of entertainment. It helps, of course, that he has a capable cast."
In the Line of Fire,7.2,102314283,75,"Eastwood hasn't had this much fun with a role in years, and his joy is contagious."
In the Line of Fire,7.2,102314283,75,"With all of that going for it, it's hard to see how In the Line of Fire could be anything less than rock-solid entertainment-and, indeed, it is. Yet it's never more than that."
In the Line of Fire,7.2,102314283,75,"This is a movie that works well when it works, and lazes around the rest of the time."
In the Line of Fire,7.2,102314283,63,"If you don't care about such motivations, this is a pretty good thriller, though not one you're likely to remember for very long."
In the Line of Fire,7.2,102314283,63,The real battle here is between two generations of acting styles: meticulous method vs. star quality.
In the Line of Fire,7.2,102314283,60,"Working from the script by Jeff Maguire, director Wolfgang Petersen (""Das Boot"") plods through the narrative as if he were completely unconcerned with giving it even a semblance of credibility."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,100,"If I were nine years old, I would see the monsters-versus-robots adventure Pacific Rim 50 times. Because I'm in my forties and have two kids and two jobs, I'll have to be content with seeing it a couple more times in theaters and re-watching it on video."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,100,"Pacific Rim gives big, dumb and loud an exemplary name and summer audiences something to cheer."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,100,"There’s no shortage of brains, brawn, eye candy, wit and even some poetry in this epic battle between massive lizard-like monsters and 25-story-high robots operated by humans."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,100,"At first, watching Pacific Rim feels like rediscovering a favourite childhood cartoon – but del Toro has flooded the project with such affection and artistry that, rather than smiling nostalgically, you find yourself enchanted all over again."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,90,"This is a noisy, chaotic, technology-crazed 21st-century action film, but also one made with tremendous excitement, vigor and heart, along with a myriad of wonderful details."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,90,"Guillermo del Toro is more than a filmmaker, he's a fantasy visionary with an outsized imagination and a fanatical specificity, a creator of out-of-this world universes carefully conceived down to the smallest detail. His particular gifts and passions are on display in the long-awaited Pacific Rim and the results are spectacular."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,88,"Pacific Rim is, hands down, the blockbuster event of the summer — a titanic sci-fi action fantasy that has been invested, against all expectations, with a heart, a brain, and something approximating a soul."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,80,"Every monster-movie archetype is here, from nerdy scientists (Charlie Day and Burn Gorman) to hard-stare leaders (Idris Elba) with a penchant for 11th-hour inspirational speeches. (Watching the former Stringer Bell bellow about “canceling the apocalypse!” is one of those great, giddy pleasures you didn’t know you needed.)"
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,80,"A huge, CGI-heavy popcorner that still feels personal. Come for the epic monster-on-mecha showdowns, stay for the likeable humans."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,80,It is one of the better dumbass sci-fi action movies to come down the pike in quite some time.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,80,Pacific Rim is big and dumb in a smart way.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"Director Guillermo del Toro knows that the charm in the clash of scale - or armor-plated titans isn't necessarily tied to the low budgets and laughable production design of those guilty-pleasure TV shows. And with Pacific Rim, he cracks the code."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"Of all this year’s loud, over-long summer action movies that, in various ways, simulate the experience of having a tin bucket placed over your head and being struck repeatedly with a stick, it must be said that Guillermo del Toro’s Pacific Rim is by far the most entertaining."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"What pulls us over the rough spots is the mind meld between del Toro the artist and the child inside him. They both want to astonish us. Geeks everywhere, salute."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"Pacific Rim shares much with the Mexican filmmaker's ""Hellboy"" franchise - jokey and comic book-y, full of muscular tableaus with huge squads of people coming and going (and running for their lives)."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"Idris Elba exudes the requisite militaristic authority as Raleigh's commanding officer, and Rinko Kikuchi is his determined partner in mecha mayhem."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"There's not a single original moment to be found in Pacific Rim's 130-minute running time, but that doesn't much matter because the familiar beats are conveyed with maximum expertise intended to provide a visceral experience."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"It's closer to the hammering ""Transformers"" aesthetic than expected. Yet the weirdness around the edges saves it from impersonality."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"Yet for all its expensive grandeur, almost too epic even for the vast canvases of IMAX, Pacific Rim is unmistakably a Del Toro creation."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"It is a ridiculously entertaining (and often just plain ridiculous) monster-robot movie that plays like a gigantic version of that “Rock ’Em, Sock ’Em Robots” game from the 1960s, combined with the cheesy wonderfulness (or should it be wonderful cheesiness?) of black-and-white Japanese monster movies from the 1950s."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,70,"Coming out of Pacific Rim I felt energized rather than enervated, excited to describe certain nifty details of the film’s wacked-out imaginary world to friends, maybe even ready to … sit through certain parts again?"
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,70,"Pacific Rim, with its carefree blend of silliness and solemnity, is clearly the product of an ingenious and playful pop sensibility."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,70,"It’s not the best movie of the summer, not by a long shot, but if there’s such a thing as smarter dumb fun, this is probably it."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,70,"To kill time between action set-pieces, del Toro has done an above-average job of avoiding tedium via some flavorsome casting, passably interesting plot contrivances and, above all, by maintaining strong forward momentum. Unlike so many similar crash-bang action spectaculars, this one feels lean and muscular rather than bloated or padded; the combat is almost always coherent and dramatically pointed rather than just splashed on the screen for its own sake."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,67,There’s no denying Pacific Rim is the best film of its kind. It remains to be seen whether the film’s epic clawing and clanking satisfies a pent-up demand equal to its ambitions.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,67,"In a sense, Pacific Rim winds up being not enough of a Guillermo del Toro movie. It's more like a mash-up of ""Real Steel"" and the ""Transformers"" pictures. Which is a shame, because the idea is undeniably cool."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,67,"Too in love with itself to ever totally go off the rails, Pacific Rim doesn't qualify as the first full-on dud of del Toro's career, but it's hard not to get the sense that something's missing."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,63,"A big, lumbering, rock ’em, sock ’em mash-up of metallic heft and hyperbole, a noisy, overproduced disaster flick that sucks its characters and the audience down a vortex of garish visual effects and risibly cartoonish action. And you know what? It’s not bad!"
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,63,"It’s the cinematic equivalent of a kid playing with his toys and smashing action figures together, except del Toro does it with more grace and imagination than most. There are long sequences in this movie that merit that most overused of terms, “awesome.”"
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,63,"The movie is an eyeful, especially in 3-D, but even with humans at the helms of the machines, it’s a hollow exercise in homage."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,63,"Del Toro’s robots have weight and mass, and their epic, Hong Kong-smashing fights with the four and six-legged, clawed and horned monsters are visually coherent, unlike the messy blur of the “Transformers” movies. There’s a light, humorous feel to “Pacific Rim” because the science is silly and logic takes a flying leap."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,63,"Guillermo del Toro doesn't rise above the obligations of staging a film of this sort as a multi-level video game, a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,60,"Pacific Rim never amounts to more than the sum of its setpieces, but it delivers on the promise of its premise."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,60,"If Del Toro is pitching for an audience of 12-year-old boys (and we do mean boys: this is old-school macho), he’s done a bang-up job. Still, there are times when Pacific Rim could be the work of any jobbing Hollywood director – the warmth and idiosyncracy that characterises Del Toro’s finest work, from Pan’s Labyrinth to Hellboy 2, is absent."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,60,Pacific Rim's wafer-thin psychodrama and plot-generator dialogue provides little for the human component to get their teeth into.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,60,"Del Toro is giving scope to a boyhood lust for mayhem, the multi-million-dollar equivalent of kicking over sandcastles and torturing insects. There is something infectiously juvenile in that."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,"It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered — long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,"The Kaijus make zombies look like wusses, so at least the fights in this film are battles royal. But overload sets in early, and it all turns into battle boring."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,"Pacific Rim made me marvel at the technology of movies, but never the magic of them."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,"""Could be worse"" isn't exactly a ringing endorsement of Pacific Rim, but my head is still ringing, and hurting, from long stretches of this aliens vs. robots extravaganza that are no better than the worst brain-pounders of the genre."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,You get 45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,"All performances remain irrelevant in the face of such expensive, explosive combat and destruction, and there the film excels: You will feel blown back into your seat, starting 40 seconds into the story."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,42,"If your basic movie needs demand a little bit more -- logical premises; interesting, marginally original characters; dialogue that doesn’t reek of throaty, aspirational monologue after monologue -- Pacific Rim will leave you feeling hollow and wanting."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,40,"Although assembled with consummate care and obsessive attention to visual detail, Pacific Rim manages only fitful engagement and little in the way of real wonderment, suspense or terror."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,38,The story's appeal is lost in all the fights between the monsters and robots.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,25,If this is the best we can do in terms of movies - if something like this can speak to the soul of audiences - maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,25,"An hour and 20 minutes into this two-hour-and-11-minute endurance test, a hungry Kaiju attacks the city of Hong Kong and eats the neon signs of every Cantonese restaurant in Victoria Harbor. It’s sort of worth waiting around for."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,20,"Laudable as its world-building is, the film drags not just in its interminable middle hour, but also during the redundant monster-on-mechawarrior smackdowns."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,80,"Terrific family entertainment, an action comedy on a par with ""Night at the Museum"" and ""National Treasure."""
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,80,"Fraser on form, 3D dinosaurs, geology lessons, phosphorecent hummingbirds, killer flying fish, theme park rides, Icelandic babe - what's not to like? It skews young, but is everything an 8-12 year-old could want. Older siblings and parents will have nothing to complain about either."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,75,"You don't believe a second of it, but it's easy to enjoy, partly because of the casting of all three leads."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,75,A legit action movie.
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,75,The most entertaining 3-D movie I've ever seen.
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,70,"A more unavoidable obstacle here is that there's not much in the way of plot -- the story is in the tour through the labyrinthian intimacies of inner Earth. As such, it's an f/x wizard's dream, and Brevig makes the most of it."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,70,"The picture works because Brevig and his actors -- not to mention his effects -- maintain a sense of humor and lightness. It doesn't hurt that Fraser, a fine actor who's made a name for himself not with his serious performances (which are reliably solid) but for his recurring role in the ""Mummy"" series."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,67,"Journey is just the new version of a 1950s comin'-at-ya roller coaster, with a tape measure, trilobite antennae, and giant snapping piranha thrust at the audience."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,67,"It's harmless fun, and it makes for an often impressive display of the latest generation of computer-wizardry. But the enterprise is utterly void of substance: instantly forgettable and about as enriching as a rerun of ""Johnny Quest."""
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,67,It's a thrill ride not to be missed.
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,63,"So the science in this film of Jules Verne's science fiction classic is ludicrous. Well, how's the fiction? Not terrible."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,63,"I don't know if 3-D could improve all movies (nothing could make ""The Love Guru"" funny) but it sure works here."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,63,"Cheesy, cheesy, cheesy but fun, fun, fun."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,63,"This dumbed-down spin on Jules Verne's classic adventure tale was devised as a kid-friendly roller-coaster ride, and it delivers the goods. Whether anyone over the age of eight wants the goods is another matter altogether."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,63,"Not exactly a movie in the usual sense, not exactly a ride, Journey is more of a virtual theme-park simulation and possibly a milestone of immersive entertainment."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,63,"A brisk, undemanding adventure aimed squarely at the family market, Journey is completely passable in 2-D. But viewing it through 3-D glasses not only quadruples the movie's entertainment value, it also explains why characters are constantly thrusting things at the camera."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,63,"For a harmless ""Indiana Jones"" knock-off, Journey to the Center of the Earth has an awful lot riding on it."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,60,"It would be barely passable under normal circumstances, but in 3-D it's a circus of excellent FX."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,60,"This first feature by veteran visual effects supervisor Eric Brevig has its transporting, if benign, charms."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,60,"Surprising as it may be, given an unpromising trailer, the 3D update of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth turns out to be perfectly charming as well as predictably eye-popping."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,60,"The cast hits the right notes. Fraser, switching between affable good sport and heroic goofball, clearly doesn't mind this stuff. He realized early on with ""George of the Jungle,"" ""Dudley Do-Right"" and the ""Mummy"" movies that his B-movie build and persona is perfect for live-action cartoons."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,60,Neither the acting nor the story matters much here; the movie is simply the sum of its 3D effects.
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,60,"Many have described ""Journey"" as a 3D film dumbed down to a theme park attraction. However, its visual splendor would have left Walt Disney weeping and Sergei Eisenstein preaching of cinema's second coming."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,58,"Like its early predecessors, it's a nominally fun trip, but it's tissue-thin and instantly forgettable."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,58,"It's inoffensive and shiny and competent and kids will dig it, and I can already barely remember a single thing that happened."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,58,"It has its modicum of suspense, and Brendon Fraser, who stars as intrepid professor Trevor Anderson – who does indeed journey to the center of the Earth – is his usual heroically affable self."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,50,"With 3-D, a little goes a long way and, in the absence of a legitimate script with credible characters, the fun dries up long before the running time has expired."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,50,"Ultimately, Journey to the Center of the Earth's minor-league visual pleasures will be most enjoyed by those with the smallest number of celluloid reference points, preferably those who have started going to the movies after ""Jurassic Park"" or, better yet, the Harry Potter films."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,50,Not so much a movie as an amusement park ride.
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,50,"If this movie is not a ride, then what is it? One thing it may not be, quite, is a movie."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,50,"Eric Brevig, making his feature directing debut after a long career as a visual effects supervisor, lurches from one CG set piece to the next, though he's helped along by Fraser's easy comic touch."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,50,"This is a fairly bad movie, and yet at the same time maybe about as good as it could be. There may not be an 8-year-old alive who would not love it."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,50,"As daft, outlandish, and speedy as it needs to be, and, for all its newfangled effects, touchingly old-fashioned in its reverence for the Jules Verne novel that inspired it."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,40,Provides tepid but fun entertainment.
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,30,"If the 3D here is better than average, SLIGHTLY, the rest of the movie brings it way, way down--not quite to the center of the earth, but at least a good six feet under."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,88,"It's a pretty good ride even if it blatantly steals some of its best stunts from ""American Graffiti"" and ""Grease."""
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,75,"I found it more pleasurable as a time waster than either ""Mission: Impossible."""
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,63,This is the kind of movie that ends up playing on the TV set over the bar in a better movie.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,63,"The story is unbelievable and phenomenally silly, not a good combination."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,60,"This new version is mindless hot-rodding fun, especially for those with a weakness for vintage cars hurtling down city streets, a group whose members include -- sigh -- me."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,60,"This retread has been bloated far beyond its B-movie origins, beefed up with more characters and an all-star cast, stripped of any real suspense and loaded down with music cuts and one-liners aimed at pleasing a crowd of rowdy male teenagers."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,50,"The car stunts are ridiculous, all lightning-fast editing and computer enhancement -- by the time action is this far removed from reality, who cares?"
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,50,A time-waster with some enjoyably empty zip.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,50,So mired in his own ludicrous equation for contemporary action pictures that it's constantly stuck in first gear.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,50,"This film, a remake of a hapless 1974 cheapie of the same title, can't even get the big chase right."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,50,Interesting and idiotic elements almost exactly balance each other.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,42,"I'll tell you what's gone in 60 seconds, all right: my attention."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,40,"There were moments when I thought Gone in 60 Seconds might be a passably entertaining movie.  I figure those moments, strung end-to-end, would total 30 or 40 seconds."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,40,"It's barely a movie at all, more like a thousand car commercials spliced together in an hour."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,40,A 119-minute trailer.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,40,Written in 60 Seconds would be a more appropriate title.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,40,Doesn't just look and sound like a car commercial. It is a car commercial.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,38,It has a tendency to run ragged and spends an unhealthy amount of time idling pointlessly at intersections.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,38,"Eventually, the senses jam and a mental lube job is in order."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,30,"Proves a theory first advanced in the movie ""Repo Man"": The more you drive, the stupider you get."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,30,"A mindless, cliche-riddled action-cartoon, a blur of metal and fire and screeching tires, with bad dialogue, cardboard characters and a volume set so high, it makes the Indianapolis 500 sound like chamber music."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,30,How did a dignified pro like Duvall get stuck in this fender-bender?
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,30,Perfectly dreadful in every respect.
Maverick,7,101631272,88,"It has great action sequences, more than a splash of legitimately-funny humor, solid performances from engaging actors, and a script that doesn't demand much mental exercise."
Maverick,7,101631272,88,This exuberant Western is a crowd-pleaser that remains faithful to the genre while having a roaring good time sending up its conventions.
Maverick,7,101631272,80,"The first lighthearted, laugh-oriented family Western in a long time, and one of the nice things about it is, it doesn't feel the need to justify its existence. It acts like it's the most natural thing in the world to be a Western."
Maverick,7,101631272,75,"Succeeds, just barely, on the good will of its stars and the sumptuousness of its Western locations."
Maverick,7,101631272,75,"Fast, funny, full of straight-ahead action and tongue-in-cheek jokes, Maverick is Lethal Weapon meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. That combination won't win any prizes for originality, but it works like a movie mogul's dream and sets the summer-film season off to an unbeatable start."
Maverick,7,101631272,75,"The film offers us Mel Gibson as a new Bret Maverick, the Western gambler, as well as the old TV Maverick, James Garner, now playing a wry frontier sheriff. These two guys can make you smile contentedly even when the script is wandering and they're just sort of standing around waiting for its next good part to develop."
Maverick,7,101631272,75,"True deft wit is just plum missing from this good-natured, flat-footed, eager-to- please, tee-hee Western."
Maverick,7,101631272,75,"As an updated version of the old western TV show, it does a pleasant enough job."
Maverick,7,101631272,70,"There may be a plot somewhere in William Goldman's script, and there might even have been a structure, but Mel Gibson, James Garner and Jodie Foster are so highly charged, as they slide through riffs that have nothing to do with anything except their own enjoyment in being invited to the party, that it's magnetic -- at least for most of the time."
Maverick,7,101631272,70,"Too rich, too loaded, Maverick may have misplayed its cards, kept its eyes on the pot instead of the players. In movies, as in poker, you can't always trust a pat hand."
Maverick,7,101631272,70,"How the West was fun: Maverick is affectionate, amiable, eager-to-please, in a TV-movieish sort of way."
Maverick,7,101631272,67,"Little about Maverick lingers in the mind once the final image has faded from the screen. But it's cleverly crafted, and you can't help enjoying it even when you know it's manipulating you as brazenly as a poker dealer with tricky fingers and a well-stacked deck."
Maverick,7,101631272,67,"The plot is one the original writers would have been proud of and with Garner, himself, appearing it gives the film a seal of approval. A rare performance from Foster who is surprisingly funny and Molina giving a good supporting performance, it's an enjoyable family film."
Maverick,7,101631272,63,"Crammed with such big-name crowd-pleasers as Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner, Maverick reaches for that Feel Good feeling. It settles for Feel OK."
Maverick,7,101631272,63,"Movies like this one - with its spoofy jokes, vacant characters and indefensible plotting - do nothing to keep the western form alive. Deal me out of this con game."
Maverick,7,101631272,63,"A financially successful exercise in target-marketing, but not much of a movie."
Maverick,7,101631272,63,"Alternately a celebration and sendup of cowboy conventions, the movie lingers over a stunning Western landscape only to be spurred on by the principals' inexhaustible supply of escapades. The burr under the saddle: There's just too much of everything."
Maverick,7,101631272,60,"Cynical and bloated, Maverick is a comic western whose high-powered cast does very little but looks damned fine doing it. Even fans of the vintage TV show may find it trying."
Maverick,7,101631272,60,"By the time Donner crowds his climactic poker game with a bevy of veteran Western character actors, decades of movie tradition have been reduced to window dressing, and Maverick leaves you hungry for the real thing."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,100,"The Equalizer is gripping, mysterious and even sometimes moving, but it’s never pleasant, still less fun. If you decide to go, don’t claim you weren’t warned. If you skip it, you’re missing one of the year’s signal works of superior Hollywood craftsmanship."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,88,"The Equalizer features some gruesomely creative violence, but it’s equally memorable for the small, gritty moments set in that diner, or on the rough-and-tumble streets of Boston. And most of all, it’s got Denzel going for it."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,80,"If The Equalizer is the hit it should be, it will give this veteran action star his very first movie franchise. In the sequel, Denzel-McCall could make things right in Ukraine as Obama’s Secretary of Defense and one-man army."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,80,"Ramping up his style to a more dynamic and elegant level than he’s achieved previously, Fuqua socks over the suspense and action but also takes the time for some quiet, even spare moments to emphasize the hero’s calm and apartness."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,80,"Willfully empty but wildly entertaining, The Equalizer stands out from its peers like a wolf among lapdogs, as Fuqua and Washington bring out the best in each other for the benefit of the audience."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,75,"Director Anton Fuqua has jettisoned almost everything related to the TV series except the title, the main character's name, and the bare-bones premise. Even the theme song is gone. For all intents and purposes, The Equalizer isn't so much a reboot as it is an entirely new entity."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,75,It's easy to see why neither Home Depot nor Lowe's chose to go the product placement route. Too many cleanups in the power tool department.
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,75,"The Equalizer, which reteams Washington with his Training Day director, Fuqua, is an origin story, like the birth of Batman, or Daredevil. If audiences and star are so inclined, it's easy to see this premise and this character - a tough, taciturn gent burdened with regret and a very special skill set - going into Roman numerals."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,75,"There’s nothing hugely original about the script by Richard Wenk (who cowrote “Expendables 2” with Sylvester Stallone), but Washington is a master at putting his own inimitable and stylish spin on even the most familiar situations."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,75,"While some might decry the ludicrous showdown that unfolds in the darkened aisles of McCall’s mega-store workplace, I got a kick out of watching Washington turn everyday hardware supplies into lethal weaponry."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,75,"The Equalizer is silly but irresistible, taking situations of inherent gut-level impact and exploiting them for every bit of emotion and tension. It could never have been a great movie."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,75,Denzel Washington doesn’t demonstrate how great he is with first-rate scripts such as “Flight.” He does it by elevating sophisticated pulp like The Equalizer to a higher level.
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,70,A tense thriller that also has more on its mind than the familiar genre constraints it operates under.
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,70,"Truly, you don't have to watch former secret agents relentlessly wipe out villains. But if you want to, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone better than Washington for the task."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,67,"This is a kid’s fantasy of how to be bigger and badder than anybody else. As for Washington, no doubt he now has his very own franchise."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,67,"Washington is always superb when playing characters with a surface calm, but a boiling-over interior. Here, as the protagonist, he steers a vivid course through a seamy world."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,63,"Bring on the sequel please, because, as fine as Denzel is, director Antoine Fuqua’s The Equalizer is not so good – a self-consciously stylized, stop-and-start hodgepodge of Death Wish street vengeance, Bond-style Russian villainy, and moodily shot Boston locale."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,63,"The material shows its age when McCall goes all ""Taxi Driver"" to save a teen hooker (a scrappy Chloë Grace Moretz) from her pimps. But Washington and director Antoine Fuqua, who teamed for the actor's Oscar-winning role in 2001's ""Training Day,"" keep the action humming."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,63,"The Equalizer, loosely based on the TV series of the late ’80s, is a guilty-pleasure platform for Washington’s slow-cooked, kick-butt heroism."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,63,"Through it all, Washington’s stillness is emphasized, so much so that the film slows down just to make sure we appreciate the presence and the talent behind it."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,60,There's a soothing catharsis in the idea that good guys are every bit as capable as bad guys of raining hellfire down on their enemies.
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,60,"Mr. Fuqua, while not the world’s most subtle filmmaker, directs the action sequences with bluntness and clarity and effectively uses his star as an oasis of calm in a jumpy, nasty universe."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,60,"The movie is tense and coiled for its first hour, then becomes routine in its second half."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,60,"Fuqua steadily parades his big moments, and the movie works as unhinged spectacle. As a thriller it's less certain."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,60,"Though overstretched and a trifle ponderous, this is a solidly acceptable star vehicle with more than enough righteous vengeance for an evening of classy thrills."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,50,"There’s a special kind of hell for artists who array vigilante revenge-porn in saintly garb, and Denzel Washington and director Antoine Fuqua should go to the front of that damnable line after The Equalizer."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,50,"This Equalizer is a brooding, brutal origin tale, one that starts well but steadily caves into genre clichés. It’s a B-movie sheep in A-movie clothing, acceptable meathead mayhem as long as you know what you’re paying for."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,50,"Mr. Fuqua, who did such a fine job directing Mr. Washington and Ethan Hawke in ""Training Day,"" loses control of an increasingly slapdash script, and the whole movie turns into a slaughterhouse. The question isn't who wants it — box office action is assured — but who needs it?"
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,50,"For an hour or so The Equalizer glides along and works; in the second hour, plus change, it turns into a shameless slaughter contrivance with a flabby sense of pace. I did like one line: ""When you pay for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too."" Washington's the rain; by the end, the movie is the mud."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,50,"Not particularly sophisticated, the searing intensity of revenge in The Equalizer is still occasionally arresting (and even entertaining) in its stylish hard-R violence."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,50,"Ponderously overlong and not even half as much fun as it should have been, The Equalizer still gets a lot of mileage out of Washington’s unassailable star presence."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,42,The lunacy to which The Equalizer descends is especially disappointing because the movie starts out with some promise.
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,42,"It’s just more joyless junk, another title to bury at the bottom of Fuqua’s resume."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,42,It's a dull film.
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,40,Fuqua’s film is lacking much of an intelligible plot other than “tough hombre rights wrongs in ways pushing the boundaries of a 15 rating”.
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,40,"Say this for The Equalizer: It gets the job done, and that job, to quote A Clockwork Orange, is delivering a little of the old ultra-violence."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,40,"Denzel is so cool, so made of pure nails he can make even the most preposterous action scene feel thrilling. But Denzel's strength is also his weakness."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,38,"All this should build up to a moderately engaging battle of wits, but Richard Wenk's script has little interest in wit and no capacity for psychology."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,25,"For all of The Equalizer’s overkill, Washington retains an admirable air of seriousness, embodying McCall as a believable figure of purity and protection, even when he’s going after his opponents with methodical, thoughtfully choreographed sadism."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,25,"It's the sign of an empty, depressing experience when the only tension is over Bob's choice to use a power drill or a weed whacker for his next kill."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,20,The Equalizer is a stone-dumb movie.
Eraser,6.1,101295562,75,"Eraser is more or less what you expect, two hours of mindless nonstop high-tech action, with preposterous situations, a body count in the dozens, and Arnold introducing a new trademark line of dialogue (it's supposed to be ""Trust me,"" but I think ""You're luggage"" will win on points)."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,75,"Eraser may lack the chameleon wizardry of the the ""Terminator"" duo, or the imperious mechanics of ""True Lies"", but the bang-for-the-buck ratio is high enough to appease even the thinnest wallet."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,75,And the guy is really good at his job: He knows how to combine impossibly macho action plus attractive self-amusement into a reliable rhythm of ooof! and wink-wink.
Eraser,6.1,101295562,70,"You're not watching anything original, you're just reexperiencing elements you've seen in a jillion other spectacles (including ""Die Hard,"" ""True Lies"" and even ""Mission: Impossible""), only with more heat, more crash, more burn."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,70,"A few of the set pieces are fussy or overly extended, but the rest is tolerable bone-crunching diversion."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,70,"The hero's feats are implausible even by action standards, but screenwriters Tony Puryear and Walon Green have concocted one of the summer's most spectacular action sequences."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,70,"It takes the usual chases, explosions, and shoot-outs, and places them in plot that involves all sorts of computerized and electronic gadgetry. Often, as is the case here, not much attention is paid to whether the ""science"" is technologically feasible, but if something looks and sounds neat, why not use it?"
Eraser,6.1,101295562,70,"However, despite having all the tried-and-true elements set firmly in place, Ah-nold's latest doesn't quite measure up to the action star's finest work, even if it should prove to be a mildly pleasing diversion for fans."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,63,"It's the typical elements that make Eraser no more than a solid bit of fluff: This is one of those movies where good guys don't miss, and bad guys can't shoot to save their lives."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,63,"What director Charles Russell (""The Mask"") and co-writers Walon Green (""RoboCop 2"") and Tony Puryear do right is supply the kind of non-stop action and laconic one-liners we live for in Arnold movies."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,50,"Eraser means to show off the star's standard persona against a backdrop of lavish special effects, which is certainly a formula that's worked before. But this is no ""Terminator,"" since its tricks are so much more arbitrary and over-the-top."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,50,"Compared with high-powered action specialists like James Cameron, director Charles Russell seems content to accomplish just one thing per shot, getting the essentials on the screen but creating no special dynamic or look."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,50,"Eraser does have a few big-ticket stunts that hold the attention, but director Charles Russell, fresh from ""The Mask,"" isn't able to infuse them with the intensity and believability that James Cameron brought to comparable sequences in ""True Lies."""
Eraser,6.1,101295562,50,"Derivative and utterly implausible, ERASER is big-budget action filmmaking at its dullest."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,50,"The picture is effectively made, but viewers will want to erase the horrific violence that erupts in scene after scene, leading to an unusually mean-spirited finale."
Noah,5.8,101200044,91,"Despite wild deviations in spiritual themes and execution, nothing in Noah approaches sacrilege or surrender, making this an acutely sensible biblical epic. It may simply be too strange for the masses to notice."
Noah,5.8,101200044,90,"Darren Aronofsky brings wild ambition and thrilling artistry to one of the Old Testament’s best-known, most dramatic, least plausible stories — Noah and the ark — with Russell Crowe infusing the role of God’s first seaman and zookeeper with all his surly majesty."
Noah,5.8,101200044,90,"Darren Aronofsky wrestles one of scripture's most primal stories to the ground and extracts something vital and audacious, while also pushing some aggressive environmentalism, in Noah."
Noah,5.8,101200044,88,"This is a Noah for the 21st century, one of the most dazzling and unforgettable biblical epics ever put on film."
Noah,5.8,101200044,83,"Darren Aronofsky's Noah is not just one of the most ambitious films I've seen this year, it's one of the most ambitious films I've ever seen."
Noah,5.8,101200044,83,"Overall, Noah represents a respectful take on an old story by filmmakers who pose a pertinent question. The Creator promises never again to wipe humanity off the face of the Earth, signing that covenant with the cheering image of a rainbow. Does that mean he won’t let us wipe ourselves out millennia later, if we’re hell-bent on doing so?"
Noah,5.8,101200044,80,"Aronofsky’s first bona-fide blockbuster is a sweat-stained labour of love. Audacious and uncompromising, it’s a legitimate epic."
Noah,5.8,101200044,80,"Aronofsky’s sixth film is not the Noah you know, but a hundred-million-dollar Chinese whisper; a familiar story made newly poetic and strange with a flavour that’s less Genesis than Revelation."
Noah,5.8,101200044,80,Noah manages to blend the expected with the unexpected and does it with so much gusto and cinematic energy you won't want to divert your eyes from the screen.
Noah,5.8,101200044,80,"Noah can be silly or sublime, but it's never less than fascinating. I was on board from start to finish."
Noah,5.8,101200044,80,"Taken strictly as a piece of filmmaking, Aranofsky's Noah is ambitious. And as theology, well, it may not hew exactly to the letter of the law, but the spirit survives intact."
Noah,5.8,101200044,80,"Inventive, ambitious, brutal and beautiful: a potent mythological epic. But also wilfully challenging, as likely to infuriate as inspire, whether through its unmitigated Old Testament harshness or its eco-message revisionism. If only more blockbusters were like this."
Noah,5.8,101200044,80,It is never less than fascinating — and sometimes dazzling — in its ambitions.
Noah,5.8,101200044,80,"Darren Aronofsky's Noah is the Old Testament on acid. It's the movie equivalent of Christian death metal. It's an antediluvian Lord of the Rings, fist-pumping, ferocious, apocalyptic, and wet - very wet."
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"Noah is more of a surrealist nightmare disaster picture fused to a parable of human greed and compassion, all based on the bestselling book of all time, the Bible, mainly the Book of Genesis."
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"Viewers may not agree about what they’ve seen when they come out of Noah. But there’s no doubt that Aronofsky has made an ambitious, serious, even visionary motion picture, whose super-sized popcorn-movie vernacular may occasionally submerge the story’s more reflective implications, but never drowns them entirely."
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"If we want a bigger picture, we’ll have to wait for God to green-light “Noah: The Next Generation.”"
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,Holy ship! Crowe’s grumpy Noah and his dysfunctional clan help God reboot the too-wicked world in this imaginative (but hardly sacrilegious) and visually spectacular elaboration on Genesis.
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"Hold off on burning Aronofsky at the stake till you see Noah, a film of grit, grace and visual wonders that for all its tech-head modernity is built on a spiritual core."
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"The film is best when it isn't trying to be an action epic, but is simply being a character study. Here stands a man, asked to prepare for an unspeakable thing by an unknowable presence."
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"Noah is no silly action blockbuster with a Biblical pretext. Rather, it's the product of writer-director Darren Aronofsky's vigorous engagement with the Biblical story and what it might mean in our time."
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"Will Noah anger some rigid purists and scholars because of the liberties it takes? Perhaps. But the point to take home is the message the movie leaves you with, which works regardless of your faith (or lack thereof). Humans are inherently flawed. How we deal with those defects is what truly matters."
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"It isn’t “The Ten Commandments” and Crowe is no Charlton Heston. But Noah makes Biblical myth grand in scope and intimate in appeal. The purists can always go argue over “God Isn’t Dead.” The rest of creation can appreciate this rousing good yarn, told with blood and guts and brawn and beauty, with just a hint of madness to the whole enterprise."
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"All of which makes the film Noah psychologically credible — his behavior is very much what you might expect of a man who has just condemned millions of screaming souls to watery graves. And it makes the film unpredictably suspenseful, which is dramatically the most welcome thing you could ask of a biblical epic."
Noah,5.8,101200044,70,"There’s so much delusion and so much delight in Noah that I have trouble distinguishing one from the other, or determining whether its most outlandish flourishes qualify as mistakes or as strokes of genius."
Noah,5.8,101200044,70,"Mr. Aronofsky’s earnest, uneven, intermittently powerful film, is both a psychological case study and a parable of hubris and humility. At its best, its shares some its namesake’s ferocious conviction, and not a little of his madness."
Noah,5.8,101200044,70,"It’s an unwieldy, sometimes overreaching effort, but the laudable ambition makes it easy to forgive some rough patches."
Noah,5.8,101200044,70,"Aronofsky’s story of Noah and his ark is far-removed from our collective recollections of Sunday school pageants and Cecil B. DeMille extravaganzas. Instead, this film opts for the sort of human-scaled realism that almost allows us to smell the dank stench of a menagerie cooped up for 40 days and nights on a water-swept barge."
Noah,5.8,101200044,67,"The result is a monolithic slab of Biblical fan fiction, at once deeply serious and seriously silly. It’s a mess, but at least it’s the mess its creators wanted."
Noah,5.8,101200044,67,"The movie as a whole is a mixed bag. It's overlong and a times sluggish. The fights and battles, designed to give an epic fantasy feel to the movie, are grave miscalculations."
Noah,5.8,101200044,63,Noah is no by-the-book Bible story. Think of it as a visually mesmerizing sci-fi adventure saga loosely based on the book of Genesis.
Noah,5.8,101200044,63,"Noah is equal parts ridiculous and magnificent, a showman’s folly and a madman’s epic."
Noah,5.8,101200044,63,"Neither fish nor fowl, neither foul nor inspiring, director and co-writer Darren Aronofsky's strange and often rich new movie Noah has enough actual filmmaking to its name to deserve better handling than a plainly nervous Paramount Pictures has given it."
Noah,5.8,101200044,63,"Impressive as much of his film is, however, Aronofsky never quite solves the main challenge of the semi-literal biblical adaptation: what is so economical, and beautifully expressed, on the page can become a heavy, lumbering beast when translated into conventional narrative."
Noah,5.8,101200044,60,"It’s Aronofsky’s least personal work. So you get a fat dose of conventional melodrama with your Old Testament: It’s the antediluvian ""Gladiator."""
Noah,5.8,101200044,60,"Noah is a movie about big ideas (environmentalism, heavenly obedience versus earthly love) and even bigger directorial ambitions (how to tell a personal story on the grandest of grand scales). But, in the end, it's also a disappointment. Maybe not one of Biblical proportions, but a disappointment nonetheless."
Noah,5.8,101200044,58,"When focused on the natural world and the internal thoughts of its characters, Noah positively crackles with the energy of a filmmaker inspired by a new perspective on classic material... But the latter half of the film, turgid and hamfisted throughout, cripples the film so severely that it makes one thankful for the added elements to Noah’s story."
Noah,5.8,101200044,58,"The director’s vision is so dark — and Mr. Crowe’s grumbling, sour-stomach persona so much like a Tums commercial — that you don’t care much what happens to him or his ark, which looks like a big barge with a stove pipe in the middle."
Noah,5.8,101200044,50,"Once the money shots of Darren Aronofsky's version recede, it becomes ever more clear that his intention is to tackle the capriciousness of Old Testament logic. And, ultimately, to assent to it."
Noah,5.8,101200044,50,"The director's murky, ill-conceived take on the world's oldest disaster story contains some of the most pristine visuals produced on a mass studio scale in some time. But it's also constantly tethered to a dull, melodramatic series of events out of whack with any traditional interpretation of the material."
Noah,5.8,101200044,50,"Noah is here not to set the record straight, but to set it on its head. This isn't a lavish work of mad genius, it's a movie designed to be a lavish work of mad genius, and there's a difference."
Noah,5.8,101200044,40,"Darren Aronofsky’s big-ticket retelling of the biblical legend of Noah (Russell Crowe, so damn serious) is a wildly stupid, yet still train-wreck-fascinating piece of work."
Noah,5.8,101200044,40,"The execution of that script – is so clumsy and over-written that nothing in it sticks. There’s a symphony of visuals here, and big strange ideas, but when it comes to the actual characters, we get automatons sleepwalking through clichés."
Noah,5.8,101200044,40,"Noah, Darren Aronofsky’s often ludicrous, occasionally thoughtful epic, puts theology front-and-center, and doubles down on its blockbuster ingredients — like adding huge rock monsters with glowing eyes."
Noah,5.8,101200044,40,"What could have made Noah work is the same sense of urgency – of fateful craziness – that made ""Pi"" so memorable, and which also factored into the fatal obsessions of ""The Wrestler"" and ""Black Swan"" (two very flawed movies that admittedly benefited from stronger lead performances than the one here)."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,80,"Preposterous, predictable, but excessively entertaining, this frenzied thriller draws both story and characters from such action classics as ""The Fugitive,"" ""Die Hard,"" ""The Dirty Dozen"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs."""
Con Air,6.8,101117573,80,"Con Air, a summer blast of a movie, teaches us many things: Producer Jerry Bruckheimer never met an explosion, a car crash or 20 tough guys talking trash he didn't like. Nicolas Cage is one of our most enjoyable screen heroes. As long as you're funny, you can literally get away with murder in a movie."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,80,"Director Simon West hits just the right note between self-conscious silliness and real dramatic intensity in this 1997 action thriller, which uses typecast actors to make the characters' one-liners and predictable behavior resonate."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,80,"Yes, disbelief is required not so much to be suspended as removed altogether, but it barely matters as this is an adrenaline blast of the highest order."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,75,"This is a movie that knows it is absurd, and does little to deny it."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,70,"Apart from not knowing to quit while it's ahead, Con Air provides quite an exciting flight prior to its crash and burn."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,70,"The colorfully written Con Air is a solid chip off ""The Rock,"" pumped up and very well cast, with the prettiness and polish of advertising art."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,70,"Numbing but not boring, it's finally more dispiriting than exhilarating, like a wild night of debauchery that leaves only a fearsome hangover for a souvenir."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,60,Con Air is entertaining in an extravagantly decadent sort of way. It just isn't a movie.
Con Air,6.8,101117573,60,"How's the movie? Big, loud, brutal and stupid, that's how it is. But then, you don't need a critic to tell you that -- anyone with a grade-school education who's seen the previews can figure that out."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,60,"This is a big, silly film. Is it full of explosions and one-liners? Of course. Is it entertaining? Of course."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,60,"Packed high with explosive action and loaded with high-stakes jeopardy, Con Air charts a generally sound narrative course, although it hits some story turbulence before it hits its climactic jackpot."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,50,The saving grace of Con Air is its sense of its own absurdity.
Con Air,6.8,101117573,50,"This movie is a perfect example of what's wrong with many big-budget films today: no characters, no intelligence, and, worst of all, little fun."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,50,Mega-budget action extravaganzas don't get much sillier than this.
Con Air,6.8,101117573,50,"From scene to scene, the tone shifts from supposed sincerity to arch and amused, until the picture begins to seem like some mad, desperate, scattershot attempt to hold an audience's attention from moment to moment, by any means."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,50,"Director Simon West makes an impressive feature debut in this relentless action-comedy that is, more than anything else, about how funny it is to see hundreds of people exploded, shot, knifed, propellered and burnt to death, and how to land a plane on the crowded Vegas strip."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,50,"It's so shameless, so psychotically nervous about keeping you ''thrilled,'' that the phrase over the top won't do it justice. It's like a drug designed for people who've done every drug and now want to be jet-propelled into numbness."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,40,"There's nary a hint of suspense in West's film, though, mainly because he loudly trumpets the upcoming disasters so early in the film."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,38,Con Air has all the signs of a hit. That's depressing.
Con Air,6.8,101117573,25,"Nicolas Cage, Ving Rhames, and Steve Buscemi are among the few performers who emerge with a shred of dignity at the end."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,20,Con Air is boring to the marrow.
Con Air,6.8,101117573,20,"While tyro director Simon West fills Con Air with all the slam-bang action and well-honed wisecracks that were the more positive qualities of its predecessors, the film brims even more with all their worst qualities."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,90,"Bigger, sleeker and better than the first, sequel Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is a joyride of a movie that takes the winning elements of the year 2000 hit to the next level."

Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,70,"The main reason I enjoyed this high-powered action flick and its 2001 predecessor is their willingness to poke fun at the premise of crime-fighting dolls, even though it now has more currency than ever."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,70,"A loud and frequently funny clown show, Full Throttle is less a grim demolition derby than a day at Coney Island, punctuated by the clatter and screams of the Cyclone."

Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,63,As insistent as it is skillful -- and it is very skillful -- it does all it can to pound you into enjoying yourself. The result is rather like being force-fed a meal of your favorite foods by the Terminator.
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,60,"Full Throttle is full-throttle camp: It's like a third-rate Austin Powers picture cut to the whacking, attention-deficit-disorder tempo of ""Moulin Rouge."""
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,60,"It's flashy, it's often funny ...,and it resembles a movie so much that soon it demands something resembling motivation, character, a plot, anything to explain the seemingly arbitrary connections between the stunts and the skits."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,60,"All of the actresses are fun to watch, and as much attention appears to have been lavished on their outfits and hairdos as on their high-flying fight scenes."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,58,"The action is ridiculously overwrought, a state-of-the-art combination of CGI wizardry and Hong Kong-style wirework so removed from the laws of physical reality that it might as well be animated."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"Its purpose is simply to allow you to soak up the happy grrrrl-power vibes of this easy-on-the-eyes trio amid unevenly executed computer-enhanced action scenes, at which points the movie resembles a video game."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"Should have been either a whole lot worse or a whole lot better than it is: If it were worse, we could simply toss aside the things that are fun and entertaining about it and not even think twice. And if it were better -- well, we'd have fewer complaints all around."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,This is one of the silliest movies ever made--and lots of instantly forgettable fun.
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"It worked once, but the novelty factor is gone. The cheese is still there, but this time it's overlaid with a cynical sense that the only reason the movie exists is because the first one made so much money."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"Nothing deeper than a stale retread, it seems. And this is coming from a critic who listed the original ""Charlie's Angels"" movie as one of the top five films of 2000."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"The film is smart enough to know that verbal humor isn't its strong point, but it doesn't offer much in the way of compensation."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"Clearly, this is something rare: a movie that insulates itself against its own rottenness by being lousy by design."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"Proudly airheaded, incoherent, endlessly pandering - yet fitfully entertaining."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,So relentlessly giddy and hyperactive that it doesnt really need a movie review--it needs a prescription.
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"A sequel whose sugar-rush absurdity almost defeats the forces of logic, taste and conventional narrative. It is a defect that might undermine a lesser movie but that in this case proves to be as cheerfully, enjoyably humid as the first blast of summer light and heat."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"Tries to be bigger and better than the first ""Charlies Angels."" It achieves the bigger, but the better is sorely lacking."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"Can't sustain its manic pitch, or work the McMiracle needed to overcome a script (credited to three writers, though more were no doubt afoot) that's less a story than a sales pitch."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,40,"There are only so many times you can see a slow-motion kickboxing scene or a figure sail off a skyscraper before you want to spend a nice, cozy evening with the Dead Sea Scrolls."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,40,"The shreds have vanished in Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, which runs at that speed during its stunts but is utterly out of gas in every other way."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,38,"A less cohesive action-comedy than its predecessor, Full Throttle is instead a freewheeling collection of random action sequences strung together with little or no discernible rhyme or reason."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,38,That sense of fun is jackhammered into our skulls. The tongue that was so firmly in cheek last time has punctured through muscle and bone.
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,30,"Two-hour exercise in chaotic action and coarse, annoyingly coy sexuality."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,30,"What fans of the original movie, ""Charlie's Angels,"" which was fun and good-natured, will make of this sloppy mess is hard to guess."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,30,"Something cold and mechanical has seeped into the sequel. The divas push so hard for fun, it kills the spontaneity that fun needs to breathe."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,30,"Isn't a full-bodied comedy, and it isn't a bona fide action movie, either. It just makes a facetious spectacle of itself."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,25,"As for me, watching this overripe, ignorant parading of Hollywood privilege an hubris put me in mind of a different song--Neil Young's ""Revolution Blues."" Specifically the bit about Laurel Canyon being filled with famous stars . . ."
Airport,6.6,100489150,50,"On some dumb fundamental level, Airport kept me interested for a couple of hours. I can't quite remember why. The plot has few surprises (you know and I know that no airplane piloted by Dean Martin ever crashed). The gags are painfully simpleminded (a priest, pretending to cross himself, whacks a wise guy across the face). And the characters talk in regulation B-movie clichés like no B-movie you've seen in ten years."
Airport,6.6,100489150,50,"Airport, the film version of Arthur Hailey's novel, is the sort of movie most people mean when they say Hollywood doesn't make movies the way it used to. This isn't just because Airport resembles any number of old Grand Hotel movies. Rather it's because it evokes our nostalgic feelings, not only for the innocence of old movies but also for the innocent old times in which we saw them."
Airport,6.6,100489150,50,"An empty reshaping of Grand Hotel, held together by disaster in the sky. Airport will be remembered as the trailblazer of the disaster epic, one of the most trivial genres in the history of motion pictures."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,85,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is as cheeky, cartoonish, and crazy as its predecessor, but it’s also commendably unafraid to demolish what had come before it if it’s in service of the story. The new dynamic between Eggsy and his team is great, and the Statesman prove amusing counterparts to these gentlemen spies from across the pond."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,80,"As ultraviolent as the first film, and as ultrasmutty, The Golden Circle will leave the Kingsfans grinning, even if its characters have less growing to do this time around."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,75,"With its inventively nutso action, youthful vibe, and subversive topicality, the “Kingsman” franchise feels more relevant than even Daniel Craig’s James Bond. Screen espionage doesn’t come any hipper these days."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,70,"The movie is too long, too violent, too silly—too everything. Yet for those who enjoyed the original Kingsman, it is a more than adequate second act. To put it another way: first time satire, second time farce."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,70,"This fleet-footed, glibly imaginative international romp stays on its toes and keeps its wits about it most of the time, with entertaining and pointedly U.S.-friendly cast additions."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,67,"Like its predecessor, everything about the stylized Kingsman: The Golden Circle teeters just a little over the top: the elegant international production values, the perfectly tailored Savile Row attire, the hyperviolent action sequences, the depiction of something more than just an innocent hint of sex."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,67,"Vaughn’s film is overflowing with big set pieces, but all those epic action sequences amount to a running time clocking nearly two and a half hours – and not much else. Like fireworks, they’re awe-inspiring while you’re watching, but there’s little left to marvel at after the show’s over."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,67,"It’s fun, but it’s blockbuster overkill after an already-crowded summer season."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,63,"“Kingsman” is essentially a live-action cartoon, one that aims for an audible reaction and little else. That may not be the world’s loftiest goal, but whether it results in a gagging eww or a chuckle, it’s a plan that usually succeeds."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,63,"True Kingsman fans will appreciate that director Matthew Vaughn reacted to digs at ""The Secret Service"" for being gratuitously violent, sexually adolescent and politically reactionary by laying all of it on three times thicker."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,63,There’s fun to be had but it’s not consistent and at times it’s disappointing how certain scenes play out.
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,63,"The movie needs an editor, or a bartender, to remind the director when he’s hit the two-hour mark: Last orders, Mr. Vaughn."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,63,"Sequelitis has Vaughn in its grip. The follow-up to his 2014 hyperviolent, boundlessly inventive spy-movie sendup gives the impression it’s trying a little too hard to surpass its predecessor."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,60,It’s a film so cartoonishly outsized that it almost renders the first film restrained by comparison
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,60,"The movie has its moments, but the bloat and the blandness take their toll."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,60,"Fun, fleeting entertainment if you’re after more of the same, but fails to carve out any fresh ground."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,60,This isn’t quite solid-gold filmmaking. But it might be gold-plated.
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,60,"Vaughn sticks to what he knows with his Kingsman sequel but rarely ups the ante, making this a fun-enough entry into an already-too-familiar franchise."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,55,"The Golden Circle isn’t strong on brains or heart, but it has no shortage of guts."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,51,"For all its supposed irreverence, the movie feels product-tested to the moon; there isn’t a single shot that isn’t trying to sell you something. The movie also has some of the creeping bro grossness of some of Vaughn’s other films."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"Just like the first movie, the film’s politics are all over the place in a way that should be fun but ends up feeling distracting. Yet it’s hard to hate this movie too much. It has a weird generosity toward its audience. It keeps giving and giving and giving, until you’re overstuffed. It’s a Thanksgiving feast movie, where you’re vaguely impressed at all of the effort, even if the individual elements leave something to be desired."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"A wild, reckless, gleefully immoral work of pop nihilism."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"Dumber and less stylish than its predecessor, Kingsman: The Secret Service, the cartoonish secret-agent pastiche Kingsman: The Golden Circle is also even more of an incoherent right-wing text, an exaggeration of the James Bond movies’ violence, fashion sense, and sex that keeps trying to pass off its ham-fisted conservative attitudes as smirking nihilism."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"In a movie as happy to resurrect characters as rub them out, nothing is of consequence, and the glibness grows numbing."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"It’s a big, vulgar, Saturday morning cartoon of a film, to both its benefit and detriment."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"It is all aggressively stylized, abusively fast-paced and ear-bleedingly loud, relying so heavily on CGI that nothing — not one thing — seems to correspond to the real world."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,42,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a tarnished sequel demolishing the original's balderdash charm in tumble-dry camera moves, CGI slosh and Elton John f-bombs."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,42,"If the first Kingsman, at its best, felt like a dry martini of a joke, then this one is more Jack and Mountain Dew — unsubtle, unrefreshing, and unnecessary."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,40,"Vaughn hasn’t only run out of things to say but people to hate, and without that underlying aggression, the movie feels like it’s just going through the motions. Better luck next time, bruv."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,40,"There’s plenty of action—and laughs here and there—but when a repeated cameo from Elton John is the best thing in a movie like this, you know you’re in trouble."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,40,"It pulls off the impressive feat of feeling both hyperactive and lazy. This is hardly the first time a major Hollywood franchise has succumbed to narrative flabbiness, or invested in grand, elaborate world building with the kind of devotion that far outstrips the viewer’s interest."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,40,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a movie in search of a reason to exist. Despite a needlessly excessive running time, it never finds one."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,40,"As kinetic as its predecessor — and just as belaboured — Kingsman: The Golden Circle serves up another batch of hyper-stylised action, irreverent humour and sharp threads, resulting in a film that’s not nearly as cool as it thinks it is."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,38,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle offers everything — several bored Oscar winners, two scenes featuring death by meat grinder, Elton John mugging in close-up — except a good time."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,38,"If you liked the original, the best way to preserve that memory is to stay away from this sequel."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,38,The hollow grandeur of the film's action only gives the proceedings a glib undertone that also undermines the rare occasions of earnestness that the heroes exhibit toward fallen comrades.
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,30,"Unfortunately, overkill is the order of the day — and it takes a toll. There are too many supporting characters, too much exposition, too many gadgets, too many “Matrix”-inspired, slow-motion fight sequences, too many plot holes instead of twists and too ham-handed a political message about the war on drugs."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,30,"Bloated, inexplicably un-entertaining."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,25,"Despite all the mayhem, “The Golden Circle” often feels slow and belabored, particularly in its middle section, when inspiration is nowhere to be found, and the chaos seems to be there just for the sake of being there."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,25,"That’s what Kingsman: The Golden Circle is like — recycled Bond gags and settings, sophomoric humor, and maybe an hour of dead time scattered throughout a two hour and fifteen minute mess."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,20,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is the bloated, campy, thoroughly stupid sequel to the 2014 action thriller ""Kingsman: The Secret Service."""
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,20,"This crazily overlong and tiresome follow-up...doesn’t seem to have the first idea what to do with itself – not least when it comes to its much-vaunted all-star cast, the majority of whom are barely even in it."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,16,"Taken on it’s own merits — or lack thereof – Kingsman: The Golden Circle feels like being trapped in a dorm room, while a bunch of frat bros watch the first Kingsman and tell you it’s the greatest movie ever made."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,0,"It’s violence for cowardly voyeurs who want to make the people who annoy them just shut up in a way that’s silent, sterile, and thoroughly humiliating to the victim."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,100,Edge of Tomorrow is the ultimate metaphor about Tom Cruise’s career. You can’t kill this guy. He’ll just keep coming. And he remains arguably the biggest movie star in the world for a reason. He brings it.
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,95,"A mix of forward-looking sci-fi, classic themes, deft plotting and superb writing and direction, Edge of Tomorrow may be the pure-pleasure blockbuster to beat this Summer."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,91,"The reason the film works is because it throws everything into the blender and comes up with something new, something that has a great lively sense of wit and humor to it, and it takes the time to fully explore its wild premise fully."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,90,"It's a star-driven mass-market entertainment that's smart, exciting and unexpected while not stinting on genre satisfactions."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,88,"Liman keeps the action and surprises coming nonstop. OK, the end is a head-scratcher. Until then, Cruise and Blunt make dying a hugely entertaining game of chance."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,88,"The movie has an organic intelligence and a sense that it, too, exists outside of linear time. It seems to be creating itself as you watch it."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,85,"For a film about repetition, Edge of Tomorrow never feels tired or familiar."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,83,"An entertaining, effects-driven black comedy, with shades of ""Starship Troopers"" in its depiction of warfare as a futuristic turkey shoot, the movie is distinguished more by how fluidly it handles its high-concept premise than where it takes it."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,83,"Despite its terribly unimaginative title, Edge of Tomorrow is a surprisingly imaginative summer action movie."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,83,"Liman stages the chaotic action scenes, including several iterations of the beach assault, with clarity, precision, and wit. This is his best movie since 2002's ""The Bourne Identity."""
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,80,A furiously time-looping joy ride and the smartest action film of the early summer season.
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,80,"Edge of Tomorrow repeats itself without being repetitive, takes itself seriously while providing some laughs and offers plenty of action without short-changing us on the intelligence front."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,80,"Crucially, Cruise knows just how to pace Cage’s shift from cowardly to courageous. Yes, we get cool effects and impressive machinery. But he and Liman add unexpected humor and genuine tension to the seasonal thrill of blowing stuff up."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,80,"The breakneck pace leaves little room for meaningful character development... But there’s imagination, spectacle and thrills to spare."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,80,"A playful and frantic science-fiction twister which mimics the best (Aliens, The Matrix, Groundhog Day) while offering something fresh and — most importantly — thrilling."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,80,"The pleasure of Edge of Tomorrow is that it’s not an action movie first and foremost, but rather a cheeky little puzzle picture in expensive-looking blockbuster drag."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,"At its best, Edge of Tomorrow plays like a tripwire time-travel thriller. As it progresses, though, the built-in repetition can, and does, grow tedious."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,"All in all, a perfectly superior example of industrially fortified Hollywood fun, and as good a guarantee as Doug Liman can offer that we haven’t seen the last of him yet."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,"The fact is that this is a pretty good summer-kablooie movie, and Cruise is better than pretty good in it."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,"Offers a more satisfying cinematic experience than ""Oblivion."""
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,"Edge of Tomorrow covers familiar ground with unexpected wit and economy, and the result is a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi fantasy."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,"I'm not sure Edge of Tomorrow holds much repeat viewing potential among teenage movie consumers, since the movie's a self-repeating entity to begin with. But once is fun."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,"Like summer movies themselves, it’s become so easy to be glib in dismissing Tom Cruise. “Edge of Tomorrow” provides welcome and hugely entertaining evidence that he’s still a star of considerable gifts, and savvy enough not to let them be squandered just yet."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,Edge of Tomorrow may be the best video game movie ever made. Which is strange since it isn't actually based on a video game.
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,"A Tom Cruise action flick with a strong female heroine and a sense of humor? Edge of Tomorrow has both of those, plus a “Groundhog Day’’-style gimmick that pays big dividends. Over and over."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,70,"It’s probably no great loss, but here and elsewhere the seams show. And in this sort of movie it’s often more fun before we get our bearings and have time to say, “This makes no sense.”"
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,70,"In Edge of Tomorrow, Mr. Liman brings Mr. Cruise’s smile out of semiretirement and also gives him the kind of physical challenges at which he so brilliantly excels."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,70,"They might also have called it ""Groundhog Day 2,"" but that wouldn't have conveyed the film's martial frenzy, its fascinating intricacies or the special delights of its borderline-comic tone."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,70,"Edge Of Tomorrow’s finale can’t live up to what’s come before, though that’s mostly because what comes before is so rich and unusual, particularly in the middle of a summer blockbuster season that doesn’t always value richness or novelty."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,70,"The Wile E. Coyote fatalities are fun, but it's that repetitive moment of horror that holds this bipolar stunt together: Cruise, bug-eyed and gasping for breath as he shakes off his fear and grimly prepares for the next suicide mission."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,67,"Cruise is better than he’s been in a while because he damps down his usual all-intensity-all-the-time MO. He’s best here when his character seems the most scared. And Emily Blunt as a commando legend is indomitable, a credit to her exoskeleton."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,67,"Edge of Tomorrow is slick, but once its fancy plot dressing takes form, it has little more to offer aside from a few impressive action sequences and the infallible grin of its nimble lead."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,63,"Cruise and Blunt have a measure of chemistry, however their characters go undeveloped, given short shrift amid the spectacle. But the pulse-pounding action scenes are briskly directed by Doug Liman."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,63,"Tom Cruise's participation transmutes, as it always does, everything around him, turning the movie's series of false starts, dead ends, and hard lessons into a working metaphor for his own career."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,63,Cruise and Blunt have only as much chemistry as the script allows.
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,60,"Thank heavens, then, for the time-loop gimmick, which sustains a full hour of screen time with enough variations on its gambit to hook you in."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,60,The film’s Groundhog Day-meets-Independence Day plot is actually pretty genius.
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,50,"Edge of Tomorrow isn’t good, but it’s also forgivable. Just please stop the ""Top Gun 2"" rumors, Tom. Please."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,50,"By design it’s monotonous, and with so much clunky hardware, Liman can’t generate the same pace he produced in the “Bourne” movies. Edge of Tomorrow has neither an edge nor a vision of tomorrow that matters today."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,50,I felt unable to decide between this movie is the most badass thing ever and OMG turn it off.
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,50,This is an action flick for those who like form over substance in their popcorn movies which explode onscreen every summer.
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,50,"Although the humor helps, the Groundhog Day-like repetition gets tedious; it makes you feel more like a hamster than a groundhog — or rather a hamster's wheel, going round and round, over and over again."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,40,"It is basically deadly serious, and after some moderate knockaboutfun, settles into something pretty dull. Where's the edge?"
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,100,"Despite a final, tacked-on helicopter denouement, it remains a gripping, relentless, supercharged slab of fun that knows no bounds - New York is its playground and the sky's the limit."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,75,"Die Hard With a Vengeance is basically a wind-up action toy, cleverly made, and delivered with high energy. It delivers just what it advertises, with a vengeance."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,75,"It's a tense, terrifically funny action dazzler with a wow level in special effects that will be hard to top."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,75,"It should come as no surprise that Jonathan Hensleigh's script was not originally written as a ""Die Hard"" film. The blend of ""Die Hard"" and ""With a Vengeance"" is sometimes smooth but never complete. It's as if ""Die Hard"" were wearing a rented tux."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,75,"Director John McTiernan outdoes the previous ""Die Hards"" (McTiernan directed the first, Renny Harlin the second) with machinery, stunts, noise, bullets and guts. Hand-held camerawork tweaks the audience's sense of anxiety further, and for the most part it works well."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,70,"Cutting to the chase: In terms of summer movie thrills, director John McTiernan's return to the ""Die Hard"" genre (he made the first one) is a triumph."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,63,"All the explosions and fights are filmed with consummate skill, and are thrilling in their own right. But that's where it stops. The pacing is erratic and the level of tension ebbs and flows."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,63,"The third Die Hard film is easily the most spectacular, featuring an exploding subway train and a manic car chase through the congested streets of New York that rivals ""The French Connection."""
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,60,"Director John McTiernan, who redefined the action genre in the original ""Die Hard,"" does devise some smashing explosions, crashes and so on, but nothing really new."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,60,"The movie turns two hours of bombings, subway crashes, car chases and helicopter pursuits into the ultimate roller-coaster ride."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,60,"McTiernan supplies one climax after another, but when the whole intense, meaningless experience is over you may have trouble putting a name or a face to the movie that just had its way with you."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,60,So little wit is expended on the dialogue and so much on the imagination of disaster that you may as well sit back and enjoy the jolting ride.
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,58,"In Die Hard With a Vengeance, McTiernan stages individual sequences with great finesse (there's a terrific bit with Willis and five thugs in an elevator), yet they don't add up to a taut, dread-ridden whole."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,50,"En route, the plot gimmick degenerates from clever to dumb, then gets forgotten entirely, and the last act simply poops out - the climax is a Bigger Bang that plays like the saddest of whimpers."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,50,"An overinflated mishmash that compels the audience to sift through a lot of rubble for the few requisite thrills, this second ""Die Hard"" sequel leaves a lot of creative wreckage in its wake."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,50,"McTiernan is an old hand at actioners and, like the pro he is, keeps the film rushing along from fiery stunt to stunt."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,50,But Die Hard WAV lacks the freshness of its two predecessors: we've had it with gassy police psychiatrists and supersmart terrorists.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,80,"Keeps playing its two winning cards over and over again, and is smart enough to realise they are more than enough. The first is the giant animal carnage itself, which crackles with fun ideas and flourishes throughout. The second is the comic chemistry of a superbly picked cast who bring everyone in on the joke."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,75,"What makes Rampage especially enjoyable is the way it sneaks up on the audience. Before casting off every shred of dignity and abandoning itself to good-humored excess, the movie passes itself off as a reasonably serious science-fiction movie."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,72,"The filmmakers try to innovate largely by making the movie as toothless and easily digestable as possible. Nothing in the film is real enough to care about past the moment, or serious enough to trouble audience’s sleep. Maybe in a world that’s already full of real-life disasters, it’s innovative enough to make monumental destruction this much dumb, lightweight fun."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,70,"It takes some time for the action sequences to fully engage, but from about the movie’s midpoint, Peyton delivers a succession of staggering set pieces."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,67,This crazy-gleeful adventure jumps between grisly and cartoonish.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,67,"Johnson’s singular charisma—his way with a one-liner, the built-in special effect of his unreal physique—grounds Rampage in a consistent personality, even as the tone veers wildly from broadly comic to selectively sentimental to casually horrifying."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,63,"When Johnson is doing that movie action star thing he does so well and giant animals are going enormous-mano-a-enormous-mano, there’s undeniably goofy fun to be had. You just have to be patient during the downtime."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,63,"It’s big, bloated, and, if you give in to the familiar charms of its jacked leading man, not unenjoyable. (Alternately, you could easily just let it induce a little nap.)"
Rampage,6.1,99345950,63,"The engaging dynamic between our hero and his gargantuan, computer-generated pal is the movie’s best surprise, with silly and straight bits both working mostly as intended for director Brad Peyton (Johnson’s “Journey 2” and “San Andreas”)."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,63,"Only two things need to be said about Rampage: It’s really terrible, and I enjoyed it immensely."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,63,"Per usual, Johnson is the key cog of a movie built for his physical presence, but it's the relationship between Davis and George that fuels the plot, even when everything around them gets convoluted and haphazard."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,"Not that you would anyway, but it doesn't pay to think too hard about ""Rampage."" Sure, it could be improved (shorter would have helped), but it gets the job done in a more or less acceptable way. Not the highest praise, but things could have been worse."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,"Rampage was always going to be the cinematic equivalent of junk food – enjoyable enough while consumed, but devoid of nourishment. When the homo sapiens are on screen, you can feel the film start to flatline but, against the odds, a computer-generated gorilla might just win you over."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,"It is entertainingly over the top, although perhaps the CGI work isn’t quite out of the top drawer."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,"Ridiculous, of course, but not as ridiculous as it might have been. As much fun as it has with the idea of animals stomping cities to rubble, it seems shy of going completely over the top, and it’s the poorer for it."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,"Rampage won’t set the world on fire (our world, at least; it sets plenty of its world on fire when George and his two giant pals arrive in Chicago), but it does exactly what it says on the tin: It’s a big, goofy romp about creatures who lay waste to a major American city while the Rock cracks jokes in a light brown shirt."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,Morgan's performance is a gem of comic timing and audience-directed winks. He elevates a movie that’s mostly about watching stuff get stomped down.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,55,"Rampage doesn’t really offer much of anything new as a giant monster movie, a video game adaptation, or a Dwayne Johnson vehicle, but it still checks all the boxes expected from it, offering one just enough entertainment value to not make you completely hate it."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,"It’s both a blindingly predictable pastiche of an action movie — absolutely nothing happens here that you haven’t seen in a movie before, with the possible exception of some crass sign-language humor from a giant gorilla — and weirdly charming."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,"Clearly, this is a star vehicle — and the eminently likable Johnson is unquestionably a star. Through sheer force of personality, he elevates Rampage into something reasonably entertaining."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,It's easy to root for George. The movie deserves the finger.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,"The problem with Rampage is that it’s not content to be mindless fun. There’s too much exposition and too many needless human villains. Plus, the tone is more lugubrious than the flippancy suggested by the trailers."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,"In the right moments, Brad Peyton can stage a ceremoniously ludicrous set piece with grace and ease. It’s easy to follow the nonsense found in the last act thanks to his assured hand, and you can tell that he is having an absolute ball with its silliness. If only we could share in that enthusiasm for its tedious first two acts."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,"The gargantuan critters are dwarfed only by the derivativeness in Rampage, a clunky spectacle that, like many Dwayne Johnson vehicles, is elevated by his charismatic presence but not enough to recommend it."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,46,This is a ridiculous movie without much desire or energy to get too ridiculous.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,42,"It never makes up its mind whether it wants to be a what-hath-science-wrought disaster movie like those old John Sayles cheapie classics Piranha and Alligator, or just a big, dumb, and loud tongue-in-cheek action comedy. It’s a movie that’s afraid to pick a lane."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"The bulk of Rampage is, alas, a slog, as passionless as I’d imagine the fandom is for the I.P. the film is based on."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Rampage is noticeably in trouble once it becomes obvious that the giant virtual gorilla is the most human presence onscreen, and that doesn’t take too long."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Compared to Rampage, King Kong and Godzilla have James Brown levels of soul. Peyton has just made another movie about the Rock running through rubble."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Seriously, the movie is pretty awful, but Johnson, as ever, seems to be having a ball, even when he’s all serious and concerned and shot up and beaten up and building-dropped-upon."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,The movie is at its best when it’s sopping with sentimentality and when it goes right over the top in its depiction of dorky destruction. Everything in between is a drag.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Some movies are feasts. Some films are desserts. This picture is cheese in a can, and if it only accepted that, it would be a lot more fun — like “Alligator,” the tongue-in-cheek classic that had a toothy terror climbing out of a city sewer."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Peyton delivers a unified-looking whole, in which the visual effects integrate well with stage and location work."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Rampage is a movie that gets buried in its own top-heavy plot, collapsing itself under that weight just like the Chicago-area buildings do on screen."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,38,A hopelessly bland and bizarrely self-serious monster movie.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,38,"Rampage might not be the worst movie of the year so far, but it’s a contender for most pointless."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,38,"Unlike 2014’s Godzilla, which benefited from director Gareth Edwards’s patience with the Jaws-style slow burn, RAMPAGE is all noise without crescendo."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,38,Rampage is a drag.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,37,"At times, Rampage almost hides its problems. It’s just funny enough, just exciting enough and just visually impressive enough. What it never is, though, is anything more than just enough."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,33,"It’s the worst kind of ridiculous: not enough so to be memorably fun, but far too much so to be taken with any degree of gravitas."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,25,"The plot is cursory, the dialogue is repetitive and the psychology is cheap. Hanging in for the wanton violence may prove too much for anyone not seriously addicted to the guilty pleasures of cheesy sci-fi."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,25,"It’s not convincing, not impressive, and after “Jumanji,” Johnson’s agents will probably never let him within a city block of Brad Peyton."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,25,"What does Rampage have? No satisfying action beats, no memorable images, and so little to say that it’s virtually impossible to say anything about it in return. It’s not a movie for critics, that much is clear. The problem is that it’s not for anyone else, either."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,20,"Rampage is a big, noisy nothing—an action extravaganza that fails at being funny just as hard as it fails at being serious."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,20,"I’m not terribly convinced that the overtly campy version of this film would be any better, but I’m very certain that this one is bad."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,20,"You know what might make an intriguing, revealing movie? The story of how, over 30 years after its debut, a relatively innocent arcade game starring a giant ape and other oversize beasts underwent a corporate transmogrification and became a turgid, logy sci-fi/action blockbuster."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,75,"Korean-American actor and former model Yune (who played a similar role in ""Die Another Day,"" the last Pierce Brosnan James Bond film) makes a colourful villain – handsome and insufferably assured, and also an unchivalrous sadist who kicks around the Secretary of Defense (Melissa Leo in a pageboy wig) as though she’s a hacky sack."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,75,"Although the film's real-world credibility is shaky, it works on its own terms."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,75,"It's that wonderful, totally unambitious yet satisfying thing, a really good movie."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,75,"While Olympus Has Fallen breaks no major new ground in the political thriller genre, Fuqua has directed a sharp, very taut adventure that keeps you engrossed from start to finish."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,67,"The action is the real star here, and it’s all good enough. It isn’t great – the aerial special effects are distractingly cheap – but at least there’s lots of it on display."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,67,"Melissa Leo has some standout scenes as the secretary of defense, who gets pretty well beaten up for defying her captors, but others, such as Angela Bassett and Morgan Freeman, have little to do but bite their lips and look tense from the confines of their command posts."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,63,Any semblance of seriousness and verisimilitude suggested by the marketing campaign is quickly forgotten once director Antoine Fuqua's enjoyably tacky Die Hard-on-the-Potomac gets under way.
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,63,The film spends its first act establishing a flimsy emotional groundwork before gleefully taking a sledgehammer to it just seconds into act two.
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,60,"The thrills and the effects are cheap, but this is in hard-driving, good-humoured command of its own silliness."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,60,A deep supporting cast brings its A-game to the ridiculous dialogue.
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,60,"Perhaps every generation gets the movie stars it deserves. “Olympus” has quite a bit to say about the current state of our country. Intentions aside, not all of it is entirely flattering."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,60,Generates a fair amount of tension and produces the kind of nationalistic outrage that rock-ribbed Americans will feel in their guts.
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,60,"A Red Dawn for the Tea Party era, Olympus Has Fallen is pretty ridiculously entertaining—or at least entertainingly ridiculous—for long stretches, dulled only by the realization that there are many parts of the country where this will play as less than total farce."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,50,Olympus Has Fallen at least possesses the frisson of timeliness amid otherwise hoary action-movie cliches.
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,50,"This unapologetic B-movie at least keeps the action rolling, and the time goes by quickly. To put it another way, I’d rather see Gerard Butler stab a terrorist in the neck than flirt with Katherine Heigl."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,50,"This is for those who like their political thrillers far-fetched, far-reaching and filled with pretty people."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,50,"A North Korean terrorist may be responsible for taking the president hostage, but it’s Bulgarian-made CGI that does the most damage in Antoine Fuqua’s intense, ugly, White-House-under-siege actioner Olympus Has Fallen."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,50,"For all the bursts of blood, the gunplay and execution-style head-shots that punctuate scores of deaths, it’s hard to see Olympus Has Fallen (Secret Service code) as much more than another movie manifestation of a first-person shooter video game."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,50,"Butler serves the cause well, considering. Think that cause is a thankless one? Shhh, don’t tell Secret Service agent Channing Tatum or president Jamie Foxx, headed your way in June with, yes, “White House Down.”"
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,50,"The countdown-to-Armageddon structure generates almost no tension, but Olympus Has Fallen does have lots of squalidly bloody hand-to-hand action, all of which is so pulpy and standardthat the film actually makes you grateful for the presence of Gerard Butler, gnashing his teeth in the Bruce Willis role."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,42,"The movie is so apolitical; there could have been a nice slant to the movie, about how both sides of the aisle could get together to kick out these Korean terrorists. Instead, it remains totally void."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,40,"Part of the weirdness of this film lies in the fact that the tense North Korean situation in the real world gives it no realism or satirical edge, or prophetic authority of any kind."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,40,"The movie isn’t a desecration, but it’s action filmmaking, not America, that needs to be reborn."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,40,"If you’re just going to rip off the action movies of yore, why not rip off more of the good stuff?"
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,35,Feels from start to finish like a throwback to the action cinema and military thrillers of decades past.
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,30,"Olympus Has Fallen is a disgusting piece of work, but it certainly hits its marks — it makes you sick with suspense."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,25,"Nearly everything that happens in Olympus Has Fallen is ludicrous, yet because the fate of the president and the nation hangs in the balance, the crisis is treated with the gravitas of Paul Scofield at the West End."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,20,"It may be too much to ask for anything more, but, on the other hand, if you’re going to go to the trouble of pretending to blow up the White House, you might also want to pretend that something was at stake."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,10,"[Antoine Fuqua] gives in to terrible instincts here, flirting with overwrought patriotism, one too many laugh lines amid numerous characters being shot in the head, and a general chaos-inspired editing technique all too rampant in today's action cinema."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,0,"Olympus Has Fallen is no fun at all. To the contrary, it soon grows tedious, odious and oppressive."
Billy Jack,6.2,98000000,70,"There are a lot of things in Billy Jack that are seriously conceived and very well-handled. Some of the scenes at the school, for example, with real kids experimenting with psychodrama, are interesting. Some of the action scenes are first-rate. But the movie has as many causes in it as a year's run of the New Republic."
Billy Jack,6.2,98000000,63,Screenplay attempts to encompass too many story facets. Result is that the action frequently drags.
Billy Jack,6.2,98000000,50,"Billy Jack is a film of violent contradictions. It is a fortysomething über-square’s tribute to the promise and potential of the hippies, as well as an intensely violent homage to non-violence."
Billy Jack,6.2,98000000,50,"The whole picture nicely conveys a Southwestern atmosphere. But much too often, at the cost of plain credibility, it stacks its cards, characters and even credo like any rootin', tootin' Western."
Billy Jack,6.2,98000000,50,A down market youth pic with Laughlin as the half-breed Vietnam veteran who stands up for America's misunderstood youth and operates a sort of one-man Countryside Commission.
Billy Jack,6.2,98000000,40,"The material played upon all the best aspects of the socially conscious movements of the 1960s, and then perverted them by preaching that violence is indeed the solution to problems as long as it's for the right cause."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,75,"While it is a spectacle of animatronics, digital graphics and other special effects, the actors are never overwhelmed by them as personalities."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,70,"Shot mostly in close-up, with nearly every action accompanied by a sound effect, the film itself is slightly hysterical."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,70,"There's something for everyone in this 70-minute special effects frolic, and lovers of the cartoon will find the movie relatively faithful to its animated predecessor."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,70,"The movie, based on the TV cartoon series, is exceptionally pleasant, and there's just enough humor to make it enjoyable for adults."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,70,"A judicious mix of the lightly gory, the generously cartoonish, and the unexpectedly atmospheric makes for action that's scary yet unintimidating."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,70,"A short, meaningless blast of fun from Disney."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,50,"Inspector Gadget may be a live-action movie, but at its heart it's more cartoonish than most cartoons."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,50,"It lacks, despite the remarkable techno effects by wizard Stan Winston, originality and charisma."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,50,"Feels like a demonstration reel for toys, action figures and future DisneyQuest installations."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,42,"The image of this kitchen-magician dream robot comes at us in little jolts and spasms that have the zappy, self-contained rhythm of a fast-food tie-in commercial."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,40,"What a joyless, fussy contraption of a movie!"
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,38,The plot was an arbitrary concoction.
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,30,"Gadget instead ends up as another mindless, noisy thrill ride that gorges its audience on bright effects and leaves it queasy from overconsumption."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,30,In the end the elaborate gimmickry of Inspector Gadget cannot conceal its very ordinary storytelling.
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,30,"Like the cartoon on which it's based, Inspector Gadget has moments of absurd fun and droll wit, but they are fleeting and few."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,25,"Disney has struck once again, taking a passably entertaining cartoon and turning it into a motion picture so lifeless that it's almost unwatchable."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,25,"A downright dumb movie that, with its breathless pace, lack of character development and uninventive gags, might be torture for even the kids to sit through."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,20,Anyone older than eight is likely to find it a ridiculously extravagant exercise in stupidity.
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,20,Are there really legions of postboomers out there sighing nostalgically over the happy hours they spent watching Inspector Gadget?
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,20,"Within a few minutes of the film's frenetic opening set piece, however, it's obvious that director David Kellogg and screenwriters Kerry Ehrin and Zak Penn have no idea how to capture the spirit of the source material."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,20,"Mathew Broderick is likeable enough as the gizmo and gadget-toting cartoon hero in-the-flesh, but the plot, to which the FX wizardry is strung to, is in serious need of a tune up."
Inspector Gadget,4.1,97403112,10,"A new standard for wretched excess is established by Inspector Gadget, a joyless and charmless disaster in which state-of-the-art special effects are squandered on pain-in-the-backside folly."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,75,"The film looks and feels good, and Washington's performance is the more uncanny the more we think back over it. The ending is ""flawed,"" as we critics like to say, but it's so magnificently, shamelessly, implausibly flawed that (a) it breaks apart from the movie and has a life of its own, or (b) at least it avoids being predictable."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,75,"The Book of Eli works, even if the preservation of Christianity isn’t high on your personal post-apocalypse bucket list. Establishing its storytelling rules clearly and well, the film simply is better, and better-acted, than the average end-of-the-world fairy tale."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,75,"Washington is surprisingly persuasive as a world-weary blade-wielder, and Oldman makes the most of a not particularly interesting villain. But the film's breakout star may be Kunis, who brings to Solara a blend of sassiness and sexiness that's reminiscent of Michelle Pfeiffer."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,75,"Though not as lyrical as ""The Road,"" which benefits from both its visual artistry and its humanist perspective, The Book of Eli employs the genre conventions of the western to make mythic its principal character."

The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,70,"Its over-the-top violence is cartoonish at times, menacing at others - which is a good thing. And truly, if one must wander a barren, post-apocalyptic landscape with somebody, who better to wander with than Denzel Washington?"
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,70,"The sepia-toned palette gets a little wearying, but the dialogue is hilarious, the violence is crunchy, and cameos by Tom Waits and topflight Brit character actor Michael Gambon are worth the ticket price alone."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,70,"The Book of Eli takes the violent, gritty feel of a spaghetti western, marries it with elements of ""The Road,"" places it in the future and gives it a spiritual twist."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,67,"Washington doesn’t look as if he’s having much fun, and who can blame him? Perhaps he agrees with me: Apocalypse movies, like apocalypse heroes, need some laughs, too."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,67,"Much has been made of the film's ending, vis-à-vis whether or not it's a pro- or anti-organized religion commentary of some sort. The Hughes Brothers, for two, say they just wanted to make a kickass piece of contemporary entertainment, and I, for one, believe them."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,63,The problem with The Book of Eli is that the narrative isn't a match for its sentiments. The script feels like it's an iteration or two short of a final draft.
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,63,"The Book of Eli isn't as exciting or funny or inspiring as it wants and needs to be, and its preachy ending is an ordeal. But Washington, a movie star who can act, is one cool dude who is worth following anywhere."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,63,"A hyper-violent, post-apocalyptic Western in the mold of ""Mad Max"" that can't make up its mind whether it wants to be corny or misanthropic."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,63,"The film’s cool-looking desaturated look (not unlike “The Road”), plentiful action and Washington’s charismatic gravitas as the taciturn hero make it relatively easy to overlook the pretensions and implausibilities in the script."

The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,50,"Starts out strong and boasts a convincing picture of the post-war world as an anarchic desert. But it comes to ditch its fun stylization for vague themes of religiosity and morality, leaving you with a disappointingly muddled movie."

The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,80,The return of the legendary swordsman is well served by a grandly mounted production in the classical style.
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,80,"A lively, old-fashioned adventure yarn with just a twist of modern attitude, it's the kind of pleasant entertainment that allows the paying customers to have as much fun as the people on screen."
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,80,"This spirited rerun, neatly mixing parody and panache, squeezes a surprising amount of fun out of the old war horse."
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,75,"The film is a display of traditional movie craftsmanship, especially at the level of the screenplay, which respects the characters and story and doesn't simply use them for dialogue breaks between action sequences."
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,75,Proudly old-fashioned in every way except the often excessive violence that director Martin Campbell splashes across the screen.
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,75,"A great deal of excitement and adventure, all brought to the screen by using a somewhat irreverent tone that keeps the mood light without trivializing the characters."
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,75,"This pleasant movie anachronism, an assemblage of traditional Robin Hooded scenarios (and superior swordplay) that, in the right light, is a nostalgic treat, and in shadow evokes Monty Python."
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,75,"The return to an Errol Flynn-style hero, who can swing from chandeliers, fight with two swords at once and ride a horse backward, recalls a movie era both sexier and more innocent."
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,70,Old-fashioned fun that goes down as smoothly as a vintage cocktail.
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,70,"A screenplay that not only has a way with genre cliché, but manages to score some deviously witty political points"
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,70,"The Mask Of Zorro is disarming for the same reasons, coasting on the charisma of its stars and a few exciting action setpieces."
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,67,"A pleasantly vicarious slice of summertime falderol, innocuous in its presentation and often genuinely fun."
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,60,Director Martin Campbell's lumpy direction doesn't coalesce into anything much beyond a pleasant assembly of set pieces.
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,50,"Spectacular, fast, never boring. But it's also one of the more disappointing movies I've seen recently."
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,50,Antonio Banderas signs up for charisma lessons from Anthony Hopkins -- but they just don't take.
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,50,A slew of writers and an enthusiastic cast all do their jobs admirably enough to provide a couple of hours of unembarrassing entertainment.
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,50,Nothing really works on any level above mediocrity.
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,50,Lavishly produced swashbuckler that should have been far more entertaining.
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,50,"Entertaining, but it's about one notch below being something anybody really needs to see."
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,50,Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas work with professional skill in a ludicrous vehicle.
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,40,A romantic adventure-movie slapstick that's too screwy for the action crowd and too old-fashioned for the Home Alone contingent.
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,100,Isn't just a fabulous seagoing spectacle. It's one for the ages.
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,100,"Master and Commander is to movies what Russell Crowe is to acting. With subtlety and power, it explores the complexities of men at war, even with themselves. It puts the passion into action, and the thrill into thought."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,100,"Rare proof that a gigantic production in contemporary Hollywood can possess a distinctive personality and its own approach to storytelling, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World proves as bracing as a stiff wind on the open sea."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,100,"One of this year's best films--a classic, even, like a C.S. Forester ""Hornblower"" story on steroids."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,100,"As magnificent as a high-masted 19th-century British warship, as explosive as a Napoleonic-era ocean battle seen above the cannon's mouth...  probably the best movie of its kind ever made."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,100,Stupendously entertaining.
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,100,"This is a rip-roaring adventure combining edge-of-your-seat battle scenes with vivid historical details and more fascinating characters than most action movies dream of. Add heartfelt acting and Russell Boyd's atmospheric camera work, and you have the adventure movie of the year."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,100,Magnificent and heartfelt.
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,100,"Like the work of David Lean, it achieves the epic without losing sight of the human, and to see it is to be reminded of the way great action movies can rouse and exhilarate us, can affirm life instead of simply dramatizing its destruction."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,100,"When it comes to the oft-doomed genre of seafaring adventure, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is a spectacular throwback and a great leap forward."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,100,"It's a wonderfully crafted work, handsome, lively, stirring and utterly convincing in its depiction of the perils and thrills of sea life. But I'm not sure that my personal enthusiasm for it will translate entirely for viewers whose favorite movie about the high seas is, for perfectly good reasons, ""Pirates of the Caribbean."""
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,91,"A story in full billow; it sails through stretches of bloody battle, anxious waiting, wine-soaked relaxation, and marvelous scientific discoveries by the remarkable Maturin (Paul Bettany, well matched again with his ''A Beautiful Mind'' costar)."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,91,Master and Commander hooks you from its nifty opening salvo to its nifty closing punch line.
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,90,"The epic adventure, set during the Napoleonic Wars, boasts at least two artists at the top of their respective games -- namely filmmaker Peter Weir and actor Russell Crowe."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,90,"On a production of this magnitude, few actors have the presence to assert themselves above the cacophony, but Crowe carries the film with the rare combination of charisma and brute masculinity that has made him a star."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,90,"Few actors can be as convincing as leaders of men, and to see Crowe as Capt. Jack Aubrey in Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is to see a consummate performer doing what he does best."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,90,Weir consistently proves that he can take any kind of material and adeptly make it his own.
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,88,"Crowe -- fierce, funny and every inch the hero -- gives a blazing star performance."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,88,"And novel insights notwithstanding, this is a plain old good movie, too."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,88,An intimate epic of infinite grace.
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,88,As gorgeous and gripping as it is faithful to the spirit of Patrick O'Brian's celebrated series of historical novels.
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,88,"A thoughtful, rousing and beautifully crafted epic."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,88,The opening 15 minutes of Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World are so well crafted that they restore your faith in commercial cinema.
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,88,"The music, art direction and camerawork blend together with an integrity and scope that's wonderfully exhilarating. Every frame seems to communicate the grandeur, power and fatal pull of the sea."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,83,"A humanistic adventure film that's both rich with characterization and concussive cannon bursts, Master and Commander is, surprisingly, some of the best work either Crowe or Weir have ever done."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,78,"For those with any interest in 18th and 19th century seafaring or naval warfare, this is a must-see motion picture. For others, it's an enlightening and entertaining experience."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,75,They've made a thrilling traditional nautical picture from untraditional books.
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,75,What makes Master and Commander so bracing and transporting -- what makes the movie feel unlike any adventure film you've seen before -- is the precise detail and care with which Weir places us aboard the HMS Surprise.
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,75,"In this journey, [Crowe] wears the uniform, the accent and the derring-do with consummate panache. Have him strike a muscular pose on the ship's prow, which Weir does more than once, and the manly sight puts that wussy DiCaprio to titanic shame."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,75,The best boy’s adventure of the year.
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,70,"Persuasively re-creates the experience of sailing aboard a British man-o'-war during the Napoleonic era, but its story never attains comparable grandeur."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,70,"The director of ""Gallipoli"" and ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" has muffled the rage and darkness of his best work in favor of an antiquated pleasingness. Master and Commander is a too-comfy classic."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,70,"Oak solid and unsinkable, Master And Commander is old-fashioned entertainment crafted with considerable care; but compared to ""Pirates Of The Caribbean's"" pleasure cruise, this voyage is choppy and difficult without ever troubling deeper waters."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,70,"Though there is plenty of action, particularly at the start and at the end with two blasting sea battles, much of the film is not sufficiently interesting."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,60,"This is an exercise in civility -- a tasteful ""Boy's Life"" adventure with plenty of boys aboard to express their appreciation."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,60,"With the exception of a brief sequence on the Galapagos Islands, where Maturin briefly indulges in some pre-Darwinian study of its unique ecosystem, the entire film takes place aboard the ship, and Weir's greatest accomplishment may be that it never feels claustrophobic."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,60,"It is a dull and boring film, pretty as a Turner landscape and as sweetly becalmed as the glassy Sargasso Sea in which the men of the unfortunately named “Surprise” find themselves trapped for what felt, to me at least, like weeks on end."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,60,For all the movie's coarse grandeur -- for all the blood in its battle scenes and the grim historical accuracy of its depiction of antediluvian medical procedures -- the story of Master and Commander feels like something intended not for adults but for children.
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,50,"Suffers from what might be called colonitis. It comprises too many equal parts, and they tangle each other up. Everything is important, which comes to mean that nothing is important."
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.4,93927920,50,It seems as if every possible cliche and story twist from any seafaring picture of the past 80 years made its way into this flick.
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,90,"Bird layers on plenty of dazzle... But his heart is what keeps the story motoring and the ending is perfectly engineered, including a coda that encourages all of us to try harder."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,90,"All hands on both sides of the camera do outstanding work. Clooney seems to be enjoying himself thoroughly as the old grump whose creative flame hasn’t been entirely extinguished, but it falls more to Robertson to carry the film, which she does with great energy and appeal."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,83,Bird has crafted a gorgeous world rife with creativity and inventive images. A Spielbergian sense of candid awe and wonder permeates each scene with a nostalgic edge.
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,80,"An amalgamation of Disney's heritage, current status and future enterprises that starts in the evocatively rendered 1964 World's Fair, Tomorrowland is a refreshing and well-intentioned standalone piece that revels in a creatively manufactured appropriation of the conglomerate's existence."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,80,"If you’re willing to let a few things slide, this is one of the best family blockbusters in years. Clooney and Robertson (literally) soar, the madcap action always feels grounded and Bird’s world is bursting with visual invention."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,80,"Bird and Lindelof have thrown everything they have at this film and, aside from a pause for breath at the end, they’ve made something funny, surprising and packed full of wonder."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,80,"Director Brad Bird deserves praise for packing such big ideas into such an accessible, rip-roaring, retro-futurist adventure."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,75,The movie leaves a bunch of questions unanswered but rockets ahead in such entertaining style that I scarcely minded.
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,75,"A spectacular ride for most of it, and while you're a little let down at the end, you kind of want to jump back on and do it all over again."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,75,"The movie is saying something worth hearing about the place the future holds, the concept and promise of it, in human existence. It’s an attempt to wrest that vision from the narrow fantasies of doom-peddling action filmmakers. That’s an attempt worth making."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,75,"There's a surprising number of salient, even revolutionary notions about human nature and intelligence throughout, none fully explored but enough to make the running time at least 20 minutes too long."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,75,"Tomorrowland is a crazy, disjointed mess. But it’s the good sort of crazy, and it’s the sort of mess you want to lose yourself in."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,75,"At times Tomorrowland plays like such a throwback to those sweetly naive, low-rent, live-action Disney matinees of the '60s and '70s, George Clooney is like a Fred MacMurray with gravitas, gruff and grizzle, predictably warming up to a young dreamer (a terrific Britt Robertson) of cheer and vision."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,75,"If you treat Tomorrowland mainly as an immense cinematic theme park that unveils a new ""ride"" every few minutes—just as Bird's last feature, ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" was mainly a series of action scenes—its weaker aspects won't be deal-breakers."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,70,"It’s so smart, so winsome, so utterly rejuvenating that you’ll have to wait until your eyes have dried and your buzz has worn off before you can begin to argue with it. And you should argue with it — even if you had a blast, as I did, and want to see it again with the kids, as I do — because it’s a major pop-culture statement with all sorts of implications, both vital and nutty."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,70,"Tomorrowland may not fully reach the heights for which it strives, but it has a good time trying."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,70,"The wonder of Tomorrowland – and with all its flaws and its hidebound Disney formula, it really is wonderful – is that Bird’s tale of nostalgia for the lost future manages to recapture some of that original, optimistic meaning without losing sight of the newer and darker one."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,70,"George Clooney and newcomer Britt Robertson are solidly compelling, but Tomorrowland remains only a moderate success, its ingenuity, wit and enormous heart too often at odds with a ho-hum story and tentpole conventionality that the film tries so hard to transcend."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,67,"Tomorrowland is a rather sweet excursion into speculative sci-fi, and, wonder of wonders, it doesn’t even seemed primed for a sequel. But this movie about the thrill of the visionary is, alas, mostly earthbound."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,67,"There’s much to applaud and much to knock in this Disney action adventure. Tomorrowland breaks the mold and becomes something quite original, while at the same time it ballyhoos its inspirational message to an extent that deadens the narrative."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,67,"Bird stages the PG mayhem with his usual grasp of dimension and space, his gift for action that’s timed like physical comedy. He keeps the whole thing moving, even when it begins to feel bogged down by preachiness and sci-fi exposition."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,65,"Tomorrowland is a globe-trotting, time-traveling caper whose giddy visual whimsies and exuberant cartoon violence are undermined by a coy mystery that stretches as long as the line for “Space Mountain” on a hot summer day."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,63,"Unlikely to be remembered in decades to come - or even in months to come, once the next teenage dystopian fantasy inserts itself into movie houses."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,63,"Brad Bird's Tomorrowland, a noble failure about trying to succeed, is written and directed with such open-hearted optimism that you cheer it on even as it stumbles."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,63,"The thing barely makes a lick of sense. Rapturous on a scene-by-scene basis and nearly incoherent when taken as a whole, the movie is idealistic and deranged, inspirational and very, very conflicted."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,63,Tomorrowland is an interesting collage of moments and ideas in search of a strong narrative and a coherent ending.
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,63,"Bird cooks up lots of eye candy, but the dazzle wears off, and nobody really connects emotionally."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,63,"In Brad Bird's film, the way forward is backward, on a path that stumbles into misplaced nostalgia and dicey humanism."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,60,"Tentpoles are rarely guilty of overreaching, but Tomorrowland has a tendency to feel out of control, a film that is finally more ambitious than accomplished."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,60,"Tomorrowland is half a day having all the fun of the fair, and half a day paying for it back in the classroom."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,60,"This fantasy adventure lacks focus when it should be laser-sharp, and stumbles when it could soar."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,60,"When it puts down its copy of ‘Political Philosophy for Dummies’ and focuses on character and action, Tomorrowland is a blast."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,58,"Tomorrowland may be well-made, but whether you're talking about it thematically or dramatically, this is a profoundly mixed bag."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,Tomorrowland is a bright and pliable sci-fi thriller that stiffens into a sermon. Can’t it just be fun?
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,"Tomorrowland is designed, just like its theme park namesake, to celebrate optimism."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,"Tomorrowland is a highly original, occasionally even visionary piece of sci-fi filmmaking, but that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,"The whole film is an argument about nothing less than the future — can we fix our troubled world or not? But for all of its vaulting ambition, its sumptuous eye-feasts and its leapings back and forth in space and time, Tomorrowland never comes together as coherent drama in the here and now."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,"Maybe the ultimate goal of Tomorrowland remains obscure because once you know where the story is headed, you realize it’s a familiar tale. The movie can conjure up futuristic images, but the story is nothing we haven’t seen before."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,"The film never adds up to the sum of its parts, effectively a two-hour trailer for a movie I’d still be interested in seeing."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,"Tomorrowland comes across as a grinning rictus of a movie, a desperate door-to-door evangelist trying to force its foot into the door and push its salvation by any means possible."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,"Steeped in a nostalgia that often feels borrowed and canned—the space-age era impulses of progress and possibility from the 1950s and ‘60s—Tomorrowland asks that you never give up or lose hope, literally and figuratively, over and over again, to the point that the movie has little else to say."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,"Brad Bird’s Tomorrowland is a great-looking, old-fashioned, at times soaring adventure ultimately brought down by a needlessly convoluted plot, some surprisingly casual violence and heavy-handed lectures about how we’re our own worst enemy and we’re going to destroy the planet if we don’t get it together."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,The glaring failure of Tomorrowland is that its central premise — children are the future — is almost completely negated by the preachiness of the execution and the clumsiness of the storytelling.
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,42,"Multiplex audiences can choose over the next few weeks between two starkly different views of the future. The remnants of humanity struggle for survival in the brutal world of ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" while Tomorrowland offers an optimistic retro-future paradise full of jetpacks and robots. Me, I'll take post-apocalyptic desert wasteland over soulless corporate utopia any day of the week."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,40,"Its idea of the future is abstract, theoretical and empty, and it can only fill in the blank space with exhortations to believe and to hope. But belief without content, without a critical picture of the world as it is, is really just propaganda. Tomorrowland, searching for incitements to dream, finds slogans and mistakes them for poetry."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,40,"The problem is, the closer our heroes come to their goal, the weaker the story becomes. What we're left with is a film that gets off to a ripping good start, but which -- given how little time is actually spent in the fanciful world after which the whose shebang is named -- ends up feeling like a cinematic bait-and-switch."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,38,"Disney’s gimmick of naming movies for its theme-park attractions crashes and burns in Tomorrowland, a here-and-now caper that will confuse children, bore adults and offend anyone who’s ever taken a science class."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,80,"Not quite magnificent but certainly Fuqua’s best since ""Training Day"" and a rare remake that actually delivers. Yee-haw!"
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,80,If Fuqua and his screenwriters (including True Detective’s Nic Pizzolatto) slightly botch the underlying theme of redemption—Ethan Hawke’s haunted ex-Confederate sharpshooter could have been more developed—it still makes good on its ideas of community pride.
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,Fuqua’s remake is a worthy successor to the ’60s “Seven.”
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,"In our post-Tarantino world, Fuqua shows remarkable restraint. The long, efficiently filmed battle doesn’t douse us in blood; for once, PG-13 is the proper rating for a violent film."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,"This entertaining and handsome-looking version of The Magnificent Seven is very much tailored to his star, right down to Washington’s real-life history as a preacher’s son."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,"The new Seven isn't aiming for cinema immortality. It's two hours of hardcore, shoot-em-up pow and it's entertaining as hell."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,"The Magnificent Seven had me smiling throughout, tapping into Saturday matinee memories without seeming entirely old-fashioned."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,"Fuqua isn’t interested in pushing the genre forward so much as respecting and updating the model accordingly. The director focuses on establishing his gang of gunslingers sturdily enough that the action becomes easy to engage with, and even get excited about."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,"This Seven’s just silly, solid entertainment: multiplex fun by numbers."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,"Over all, this is a rousing, albeit sometimes cheesy, action-packed Western bolstered by Denzel Washington’s baddest-of-the-baddasses lead performance, mostly fine supporting work, and yep, some of the most impressively choreographed extended shootout sequences in recent memory."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,Fuqua's film is ultimately a reminder of why the genre was once so wildly popular in the first place.
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,"Truly, The Magnificent Seven is a story of simple pleasures, and it gets the little things right."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,70,"If body count is what you go to Westerns for, by all means drift into this one's corral. It's hardly magnificent, and apart from its casting it's not doing anything particularly original with its premise. But it's diverting in about the way you'd expect of a remake twice removed — call it a perfectly competent seven."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,70,"Magnificent Seven has one and only true goal: It’s a new Hollywood crack at good, old-timey entertainment."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,70,"It’s a fun movie, a nicely made Western in which bad guys get to be good guys sometimes. Maybe that should be enough, but you can’t help wanting more."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,67,"The marketing may try to dress it up like a prestige picture, but Magnificent Seven is a summer season thrill ride."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,63,"Pure blockbuster gloss – perfectly fine for a Saturday afternoon matinee, but instantly forgettable once you’ve emerged from the dark of a multiplex."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,63,"It ain’t Shakespeare, or even Kurosawa. But it’s an acceptable remake of a western that itself was an acceptable remake of one of the greatest movies ever made. Enjoyable, even, until the last act proves how dull an overextended gun battle can get."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,63,"As passably entertaining as the film is, it never surrenders to the abandon of its action, and as such never feels like it shifts out of first gear."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,60,"You get enough of a sense of this place and these men — and that widow! — that it's a disappointment when, in the end, we just have to watch it all blow to hell."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,60,"Struggling with tone and urgency during its recruiting phase, the film clomps along to a pedestrian drum-roll, summoning a stark, brooding edge without quite enough lift-off."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,60,"The film is mindless entertainment by way of scoundrels, dynamite and honor – not quite magnificent, but “The Watchable Seven” just doesn’t have the same ring to it."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,60,"The new movie is as moth-eaten as the serapes strewn through the 1960 film, but there’s no denying the appeal of the image of Mr. Washington riding a horse, shooting a Colt and leading a posse of vigilantes to save a mostly white Western town."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,60,"There’s a fine line between a slowburn and dull, and this Magnificent Seven frequently finds itself on the wrong side."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"Traces of real history are hard to spot in Fuqua’s Western, but there isn’t much evidence of a real Western, either. You sense that an entire genre, far from being revitalized, is being plundered for handy tips."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"The picture is action-packed but mindlessly so, and it’s neither light enough to work as a coltish entertainment nor smart enough to cut beyond anything but the most rote notions of masculinity."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"Despite a great cast and several terrific action sequences, Fuqua's film is largely forgettable."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,The Magnificent Seven is like a long-fused stick of dynamite: It takes forever to get interesting but does at least unleash an explosive finale.
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"If there’s a compelling reason to remake The Magnificent Seven, it can’t be found in the 2016 version, a loud, cluttered, and generally disappointing production."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"This movie's all over the place, trying too hard to be all Westerns to all sensibilities."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"The Magnificent Seven is fine as far as it goes, but — especially when the familiar strains of the 1960 theme song begin wafting over the final scenes — one can’t help feeling that it should have gone much further."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,Go in with low expectations and you might be pleasantly surprised.
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"Only when there’s an opportunity to blow things up does Fuqua seem fully engaged.
Another Western bites the dust."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"A sense of lethargy hangs uneasily over the lumbering new version of The Magnificent Seven. Despite its sturdy plot, seasoned director and capable cast toplined by Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke, it arrives in a comatose state, a film unlikely to arouse passions one way or another."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"More importantly, copying an earlier era’s empty slickness still produces only empty slickness."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,Neglects to provide the characters with enough background history to explain what makes them such original figures in the Old West.
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"This “Seven” is more diverse, less patronizing than the famous Western it remakes. But it lacks the moral certitude and righteousness of its predecessor, a pre-Vietnam “America saves Paradise from a Dictator” allegory."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,The group...make a fine crew. But the rest of the movie doesn’t find enough interesting wrinkles on the old formula to merit a reboot.
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"The sheer talent of the cast here sometimes provides enough depth to get audience members to the climactic shoot-out, and there are a few definite MVPs in terms of ensemble, but it’s hard to envision this film having anywhere near the cinematic legacy of those that inspired it."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"Fuqua is trying for John Ford meets Sergio Leone: a funky classical sweep, with room for delirious shootouts. The trouble is that he mimics the trademarks of those directors without their élan, and the plot that was once catchy is now rote."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"Except for the fact that virtually every shot, chop or stab the good guys make hits its mark to make the bad guys quickly drop like toy soldiers, the climactic showdown delivers what it needs to action-wise, leading to a satisfactory wrap-up."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"The performances are dedicated, but the camaraderie feels perfunctory, outside of a few ruminative exchanges between Hawke and Washington."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,40,"The Magnificent Seven has the trappings of a classic Western and it hits its marks. All of Fuqua’s movies hit their marks — even sadistic formula junk like ""The Equalizer."" But there’s no grandeur in its images or generosity in its soul. I don’t think Fuqua ever loved Westerns. And by the time this movie ended, I’d forgotten why I do."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,40,"Instead of ever getting truly ""Magnificent,"" these multicultural gunslingers remain largely a meh seven."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,40,"As a result, while the film is certainly intense at times, it's not some sort of Sam Pekinpah blood-fest."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,40,"Slick but forgettable, Fuqua’s suicide squad is a macho posse movie that could use a jab of fun. It’s The Magnificent Seven, but the “magnificent” is silent."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,40,Richard Wenk and Nic Pizzolatto's screenplay completely lacks the interpersonal vibrancy that a film like this needs and this is glaring given that it maintains the slow-build tension of the original.
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,40,"Because the roles are underwritten and the players struggle to establish a rapport, The Magnificent Seven never lets the audience feel like its along for the ride with a dynamic group of death-or-glory hombres."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,30,"Ethan Hawke is appealing as a polysyllabic coward of some complexity, but Mr. Washington has been stripped of his usual verve and grace. Sometimes you can catch him going slack, like a man looking for the exit."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,25,"It would be too easy to say The Magnificent Seven isn’t magnificent. It’s definitely not, but the film has an even more egregious quality: it’s uninspired. There’s no risk, no real attempts to subvert expectations, and no desire to truly give the audience something, if not entirely new, then at least surprising."
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,80,Surprisingly witty and sophisticated spy movie spoof that will tickle adult pet lovers and still capture kids 6 and older with its boy-and-his-dog love story and pet slapstick.
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,80,"An hour and a half of giddy, ridiculous fun."
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,75,One of the movie's most enjoyable in-jokes is the way some of the animals actually look a little like the humans doing their voices.
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,75,"For its first hour, it's a delightful cloak-and-dagger comedy starring a brave Beagle James Bond and a depraved Persian Dr. Evil."
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,70,Only a sourpuss could fail to be amused by this movie's sight gags and action sequences or to be charmed by its lighthearted good humor.
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,67,The plot and script sag like worn out chew toys just when Cats & Dogs should be in full squeak.
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,63,"As delicious as this premise is, Cats & Dogs is about as funny as a hairball left on your pillow."
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,63,This special-effects animal-action comedy is for heavily identified pet owners.
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,60,Some stunts and jokes are genuinely clever.
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,50,It is never less than interesting. But who wants interesting from a movie called Cats & Dogs? It needs to grab the audience by the scruff of the neck and shake it.
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,50,"The effects are so showy, and so relentless, that they call attention pretty quickly to the fact that there is not much else to Cats and Dogs."
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,50,"""Shrek"" had some refreshing, genre-twisting innovation but Cats & Dogs plays it safe and nice instead and, by not taking risks, doesn't quite make it out of the doghouse."
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,50,"Inoffensive fun that kids will love and adults will likely love too, it's a middle of the road affair, but a far cry from roadkill."
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,50,"At its best, Cats & Dogs plays like a live-action Tex Avery cartoon, down to the exploding ACME dog bone; it's slapstick and slapdash, full of silly and violent nonsense worth a chuckle or two as dogs slam into glass doors and cats play dead on suburban streets."
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,50,This comically intended battle of the species is family entertainment for families that will buy anything.
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,50,"Plays cleverly to adults, but will fly straight over the heads of minors, who have little but a lone fart joke and wave upon wave of flying fur to keep them laughing."
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,50,"This family entertainment hard sell lags far behind even ""Dr. Dolittle 2."""
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,50,Inconsistency of tone and internal logic plagues the film throughout.
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,50,"The premise is tragically flawed and politically incorrect. In fact, it is blatantly cat-ist."
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,40,"Irritating, childish and more frantic than funny, Cats & Dogs does manage some few pleasant moments, but they are not worth waiting for."
Cats & Dogs,5.2,93385515,38,The plot pants so hard -- that it makes less sense than the average pet-food commercial.
Elysium,6.6,93050117,88,"Damon’s everyman workhorse is tragically sympathetic, plodding ahead against all odds. Copley is brilliant as the sadistic villain.  Foster is … well, you gotta see it to believe it.  In the meantime, you’ll be treated to one of the most entertaining action films of the year."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,83,I wish that the film had more of the tasty futuristic detail promised by that dummy parole officer. I also wish that Blomkamp took us deeper into the world of Elysium.
Elysium,6.6,93050117,83,"With Elysium, Blomkamp has made good on the promise of ""District 9"" and proven that working on a bigger canvas doesn't mean compromising on smarts or aspirations to deliver tentpole sized stories with a thoughtful backbone."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,80,"In lesser hands, Elysium might have played like a Lib Dem manifesto with extra spaceships, but the South African filmmaker wants to explore ideas, not wave placards, and whether or not you agree with the film’s politics, the fire in its belly is catching."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,80,"Not perfect, but a much more satisfying Earth-in-ruins film than Oblivion or After Earth. It is a little more conventional than District 9 (what isn’t?), but confirms Blomkamp as one of the potential science-fiction greats of this decade."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,80,"At last, a good big film. The legacy of the summer, thus far, has been jetsam: moribund movies that lie there, bloated and beached, gasping to break even. But here is something angry and alive: Elysium."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,80,"Even working within a more conventional framework, Blomkamp again proves to be a superb storyteller. He has a master’s sense of pacing, slowly immersing us into his future world rather than assailing us with nonstop action, and envisioning that world with an architect’s eye for the smallest details."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"In a summer of antiseptic effects spectacles, Elysium stands out for its grime and intensity, as well as the bluntness of its class allegory."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"Among the slew of recent futuristic hell-in-a-handbasket spectacles, Elysium takes the cake."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"Elysium proves better at social polemics than escapism, a balancing act Blomkamp managed well in District 9, with its allegory of South Africa's apartheid era."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,Decidedly more thought-provoking than most big-studio summer fare.
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"This vision of a violent future makes Elysium well worth seeing, even as the conventional violence of the thriller finale makes it a missed opportunity."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"Blomkamp's universe is a fascinating place to visit and the movie is stuffed with ideas - there's far too much here to satisfactorily explore in 109 minutes, especially when one considers that room must be made for action scenes. I departed the theater satisfied with what I'd seen but wanting more."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"With most films, that'd be enough to cut out half the potential American audience. But effective, evocative science fiction, which Elysium is, has a way of getting by with an ILA (Insidious Liberal Agenda) in the guise of worst-case dystopia."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"Like District 9, an allegory of apartheid that took four Oscar nods and put Blomkamp on the map, Elysium delivers sci-fi without dumbing it down. It's a hell-raiser with a social conscience."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"Elysium, the second movie from writer-director Neill Blomkamp, isn’t quite as inventive or fresh as his knockout debut, 2009’s ""District 9."" But the new picture is cut from the same cloth — furiously exciting sci-fi, carefully considered and loaded with allegories and social commentary."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"Appreciate Elysium for what it is, sci-fi that’s smarter, more topical and more invigorating than most of what passes through that genre these days, and another sign that its director is the most promising chap to enter the field since the inception of Christopher Nolan."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"If Elysium is the brainiest Hollywood movie of the summer, it's also the most conflicted one."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"If Elysium isn’t the post-millennial sci-fi masterpiece I was hoping for, it has tremendous resonance and is pretty doggone good for its category."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,70,"Mr. Damon brings both a weary optimism and convincing physicality to Max, who is no revolutionary. He just wants to live, and is willing to don an exoskeletal combat suit and fight robots to do it."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,70,Mr. Damon’s performance helps keep the movie from sinking under the weight of its artfully constructed horrors.
Elysium,6.6,93050117,70,"What made “District 9” special was attention to details: You believed in the characters, their society and their surroundings. The big effects in Elysium work fine. But the people never become individuals, and the vagueness and coincidental nature of the storytelling undermine its structure."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,67,"A high-low tension runs through Elysium, not only in the narrative itself, but in Blomkamp’s own cinematic language, which can be lofty one moment and gleefully pulpy the next."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,63,"It’s a letdown, but this director’s still a talent to be reckoned with."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,63,"A cheekily gruesome and genuinely urgent entertainment, Blomkamp's latest nevertheless can't help but beg the question: Where's Snake Plissken when you need him?"
Elysium,6.6,93050117,63,"Nothing in the movie matches the fascination of its premise and its opening 10 minutes: the undisturbed status quo is mesmeric. Once the narrative grinds into gear, however, the film's distinctive quality is lost."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,60,"Although the pulp energy that Blomkamp brings to this material makes it consistently watchable, the film doesn't feel as singular as we would have hoped."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,60,"This is a messy, poorly structured film, riddled with plot holes and lacking any kind of satisfying conclusion."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,60,"For all its simple politics, clanging dialogue, and underwritten roles—only Damon’s natural, and deepening, ability to suggest unspoken disappointment gives his character dimension—Elysium works, though never as well as it should."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,60,"Unfortunately, Elysium devolves. It doesn’t address the ramifications of making everyone healthy for eternity, or what it is on Earth they’re making or digging up that fuels whatever economy is left on the space station. For such a well thought-out premise, there’s not a mention of how capitalism works in this futureworld."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,60,"This perfectly alright actioner will entertain newcomers, while leaving Blomkamp fans in a holding pattern until his next project."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,60,"Hollywood loves these apocalypse-soon stories, however, because they function as blank canvases for ruin porn, and if nothing else, Neill Blomkamp’s Elysium gives us the realistically trashed tomorrow we suspect we deserve."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,60,"Granted, Elysium could be more clever as it goes about its business. This is smart sci-fi, but it's not as smart as it could have been -- or as many ""District 9"" fans were probably hoping it would be."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,60,"Frankly, Elysium is a bit of a liberal’s wet dream: the good guys want accessible healthcare, while the bad guys want to do away with undocumented immigrants."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,59,"Blomkamp overdoes even his best effects. (I would have welcomed more vistas of Elysium to break up the grungefest.) If Elysium is an example of how recession-era Hollywood intends to dramatize the rift between the haves and the have-nots, let’s hope the studios don’t also bring back Smell-O-Rama."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,58,"With Elysium, the director proves that he still has one hand on the X-Box controller; maybe he should give the allegories a rest already and just get back in the game."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,58,"The action is bludgeoning. When Max gets pummeled by fists and lethal objects, we get pummeled by light and noise and rock-'em-sock-'em editing. No shrimp, though. As a narrative, ""District 9"" wasn't particularly original, either — in the end it was a standard conversion melodrama. But everything is better with shrimp."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,50,"Kudos to Blomkamp for not shying away from social issues in his films, but here the execution doesn’t live to the intentions."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,50,"While the movie may not, in the end, be so effective in tapping into our current class anxieties, that hardly seems to matter. Like a trip to Elysium, it’s a wild ride."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,50,"Ultimately, Elysium ends up with explosions, running gun battles, and summer non-blockbuster tedium. The outcome is never in question, and while Blomkamp has proven himself to be a master of sci-fi social commentary in the past, this dull wheel in the sky just lands with a resounding thud."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,40,"Damon is as buff as ever, maybe even more so... But watching him lumber through Elysium's bramble of lofty ideals is no damn fun."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,40,"All the interest and good will built up by the sharply conceived preliminaries is washed away in a succession of scenes that feel crushingly routine and generic, not to mentioned guided by ideological urges."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,40,One of Blomkamp’s most unlikely conceits is a machine – apparently standard-issue in all of Elysium’s made-to-order McMansions – that can heal all injuries and infections at the flick of a switch. He could have used one to fix Elysium’s battered and broken screenplay.
Elysium,6.6,93050117,38,"For a 99 percenter movie, then, Elysium is kind of a head-scratcher. It throws away its best opportunity for drama. It’s as if Han and Leia parked on the Death Star and started asking, “How much is a two-bedroom around here?”"
Elysium,6.6,93050117,38,"Blomkamp proceeds to spend the last two-thirds of his film crashing spaceships into lawns, or staging high-tech fistfights between Elysium’s stolid hero and his even duller arch-nemesis. It’s a waste of a perfectly good dystopia."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,30,The result is a grim and predictable adventure saga that is not nimble but leaden. Dystopia has rarely been so dysto-pointing.
Non-Stop,7,92168600,83,"Once you accept that he (Neeson) has the badge and gun, you’re in for an exciting trip."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,83,"Part locked-room mystery, part political allegory, Non-Stop is one of the most purely enjoyable entries in the ongoing cycle of Liam Neeson action-thrillers."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,75,It’s all fairly entertaining and eminently disposable.
Non-Stop,7,92168600,75,"Non-Stop mostly works by being aware of what other jet-in-jeopardy flicks have done before, adding a spin here and there. Nothing Hitchcockian but more ambitious than a Neeson action flick needs to be."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,75,"There’s a good measure of comedic relief doled out between the action sequences, e.g., Neeson coming up with an ingenious plan to placate the passengers when they’re on the verge of a rebellion. This is a movie that knows it’s not to be taken too seriously."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,75,"The movie's fun. And now, thanks to our annual Neeson thriller, spring can come soon."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,75,"Once again Neeson is a straight-faced secret weapon. With his lion's roar and can-do fists, he grounds the film's more preposterous moments and makes them feel excitingly tense. At a certain point either you'll fasten your seat belt and go with Non-Stop's absurd, Looney Tunes logic or you won't."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,75,"Non-Stop isn't exactly a smooth ride, but as far it being the big screen equivalent of an airplane novel, one that you read on the flight and throw away when you get to your destination, it is wildly successful. Just don't think too hard about it."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,73,"A relatively high-flying adventure, injecting the always-entertaining airplane-set thriller with some fresh thrills and a cadre of characters worth getting invested in."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,70,"Non-Stop is a crisp, efficient thriller that benefits greatly from the intangibles Neeson can be counted on to supply."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,70,"Non-Stop doesn’t make any sense, but that’s expected, uninteresting and incidental to the pleasures of a slow-season Liam Neeson release as diverting as this one."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,63,"If I wanted to read my way through a film that features words dancing around the screen as if they were waltzing Post-Its, I would have sat through a foreign movie with subtitles instead."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,63,Non-Stop plays like what might happen if Michael Bay directed a screenplay developed for Alfred Hitchcock.
Non-Stop,7,92168600,63,"While it takes stabs at realism, mostly in its use of cellular and computer technology, disbelief must be suspended for full immersion in this twisty airborne thriller."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,63,"Writers John W. Richardson, Chris Roach, and Ryan Engle bet that the central hook — Who’s the bad guy? How’s he doing this? — will keep us paying attention. And they’re right."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,63,"Luckily, Non-Stop has a way-above-average cast for this kind of nonsense."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,63,Non-Stop: It is what it is.
Non-Stop,7,92168600,63,"Collet-Serra, who directed Neeson in “Unknown,” has a knack for keeping things lively and moving forward. There are moments of humor, gripping action and real terror."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,63,The latest collaboration between director Jaume Collet-Serra and star Liam Neeson is made with far more care and visual detail than you might expect.
Non-Stop,7,92168600,60,"The key to a good B-mystery is that all the actors should be a little stilted. You should never know the difference between an actor acting badly and an actor doing a masterful acting job of someone acting badly. In Non-Stop, there is much excellent bad acting."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,60,"It keeps you guessing, it keeps the tension ratcheted up, and it offers a dose of breathless -- if sometimes brainless -- suspense."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,60,"It's Liam Neeson at his Neesoniest, and yet another entry in his expanding late-career bloom into gruff and commanding action hero."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,60,The best twist is how Neeson’s growly presence makes a bumpy ride enjoyable.
Non-Stop,7,92168600,60,"Non-stop is the flimsiest of black box recorders, by contrast, that never threatens to make even intermittent sense, but it hangs together on the bulky shoulders of its star."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,60,"Would that the climax lived up to the tension-filled first two thirds. Let’s just say that Non-Stop reaches for some pointed post-9/11 political commentary that almost entirely exceeds its grasp. Total brainlessness, in this case, would have been a virtue."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,60,"Even in the movie’s most ridiculous moments, Collet-Serra keeps the pacing brisk and knows how to divert our attention with a well-timed bit of comic relief."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,50,It's a completely average film that makes a few terrible choices.
Non-Stop,7,92168600,50,"Shot in grainy, unflattering closeups occasionally alleviated by flashily edited fight scenes, Non-Stop is no more or less than what it intends to be: the kind of midlevel brainless entertainment you might watch, between meals and naps, on an international flight. Try to enjoy the ride — and no texting, please."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,50,"Non-Stop gets increasingly far-fetched as the jet makes its way across the Atlantic. Certainly, there are more red herrings on the plane than there are in the sea below. And Neeson has to stare down every last one of them."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,50,"Much of the fun is awfully silly. The story strains logic, as well as credulity. It's been cobbled together, often crudely, from pieces of classic predecessors. (Here snippets of Hitchcock, there stretches of ""Speed,"" with wings on the bus.) Yet the silliness parades itself in a spirit of cheerful self-awareness, while Liam Neeson fills the thrill quotient impressively as an air marshal."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,50,"Thanks to him (Neeson), I not only enjoyed Non-Stop, but I'd watch it again. Particularly on a plane."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,50,"Neeson’s innate dignity can often serve as a gravitational force for movies this ludicrous, but in a cabin filled with so much flying debris, he is but an ineffectual paperweight."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,50,"A constant low-boil of ridiculousness both mocks and sustains Non-Stop, a jerry-rigged terror-on-a-plane thriller with a premise so far-fetched as to create a degree of suspense over how the writers will wriggle out of the knot of their own making."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,50,"Non-Stop is a solid, workmanlike action picture that builds slowly, bends over backwards to over-explain itself and its villain, and delivers a lulu of an ending."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,40,"As suspicion shifts from passenger to passenger, the film starts to resemble a parlor-room whodunit, while logic becomes its first fatality. Fasten your seat belts before takeoff, because Non-Stop is a bumpy ride."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,40,"There’s no rescuing Non-Stop from its own worse impulses. The likable Neeson’s implausible second act as an action star continues, but not in a believable direction."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,40,"A nifty lift-off and a tense first hour lead us, disappointingly, to a very bumpy landing. While Neeson and co. do their best, the script just doesn’t deliver where it really matters."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,40,"In the end, Non-Stop is a waste of a perfectly good Neeson, and of our time and goodwill. Please make it stop."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,25,"From the evidence presented here, this film's three screenwriters have not only never taken a commercial flight, they've never met any actual human beings.  The details of air travel and human behavior are equally foreign to the film."
Non-Stop,7,92168600,25,All the tedium of an endless trans-Atlantic flight gets packed into the 105 minutes of Non-Stop.
Non-Stop,7,92168600,20,"Non-Stop is weak sauce, a cheapie snoozer that not even heavyweights like Neeson and Moore can save."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,100,"The submarine drama, which opens today, has everything you could want from an action thriller and a few other things you usually can't hope to expect: an excellent script, first-rate performances and a story that has more to do with individuals than explosions."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,91,"Directed by Tony Scott, Crimson Tide is the kind of sumptuously exciting undersea thriller that moves forward in quick, propulsive waves."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,90,"Crisp as the creases in its naval officers' uniforms, this tale of seething conflicts aboard an American submarine on the eve of nuclear war is strictly by-the-numbers, but hardly ever are traditional elements executed with such panache."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,88,"Oddly enough, Crimson Tide develops into an actors' picture, not just an action movie. There are a lot of special effects, high-tech gadgets and violent standoffs, yes, but the movie is really a battle between two wills."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,88,"Directed by Hollywood's slickest hack, Tony Scott (""Top Gun""), with a script doctored by Quentin Tarantino--you won't need sonar to spot his contributions."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,80,"Equipped with liberal helpings of square-jawed top quality Hollywood thespianism, and that expensive, highly commercial Tony Scott gloss-finish, this submarine-set mutiny thriller is about as good as it gets."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,80,"While skillfully crafted to maximize visual excitement and dramatic fireworks through the first hour, relentlessly paced pic sports a fancy new package for a rather shopworn doomsday scenario that unravels to increasingly familiar effect as the finale breathlessly approaches."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,75,"It's a thrill-a-minute ride that concludes with a whimper, like a roller-coaster that has all the drops and twists early. Make no mistake, this is a good source of early summer fun, but with a little extra imagination, it could have been a whole lot more."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,75,"It's too slick to be truly disturbing, but it's that slickness that keeps you on the edge of your chair."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,75,"The movie has nothing intelligent to say about post-cold-war tensions or anything else, but it's great fun to watch Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington square off in a submarine that looks like a cross between the Starship Enterprise and something you'd get in a cereal box."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,70,"The scenario may be dumb and predictable, with a wimpy ending to boot, but it's also sort of fun."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,67,"Go see it, get the adrenaline rush, and then go home and forget about it. It's noisy and fun, but that's all it is."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,60,"Most egregiously, the filmmakers set up a classic struggle between right and wrong and then, in a coy coda, refuse to take a stand."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,60,"The action is loud and flashy, but there isn't really much suspense. The movie operates in such well-charted waters that it feels less like a dangerous naval mission than like a luxury cruise: the accommodations are cozy and the activities carefully planned."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,50,Crimson Tide is better watched for its toy appeal and high-priced talent than for any real suspense over where Hunter's mutinous instincts will lead the story.
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,50,"Nope, this picture doesn't bear thinking about, but, if you resist that nasty temptation, setting all your mental gauges at Dead Slow, the flow of the action will see you through."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,50,"When in doubt, director Tony Scott (""Top Gun"", ""Days of Thunder"") lets loose a spray of water, sparks and sweat-the signature flourish of this Helmut Newton of movie machismo."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,50,"Behind all the macho bluster stand (or, it would appear, sit) director Tony Scott, writers Michael Schiffer and Richard P. Henrick, and producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, trying (and failing) to get all the characters to behave like grown-ups."
Crimson Tide,7.3,91400000,40,"Ultimately, this is a war of boorishness vs. sensitivity, and the filmmakers waffle."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,75,"Like every other action movie, it's designed for a 14-year-old boy's mentality, but it's enjoyable enough to turn most people into 14-year-old boys."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,70,"The Scorpion King, so far from perfect it isn't funny, is nevertheless one of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself, namely, an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,70,Rouses excitement mostly from stuntwork and thesp agility rather than CGI excess.
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,70,"Director Chuck Russell (""The Mask"") keeps the computer effects to a minimum, emphasizing instead the essential ingredients of a Saturday-afternoon serial, namely, venom-tipped arrows, pissed-off cobras and a buxom babe."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,70,"Chuck Russell doesn't make masterpieces -- he makes good B movies (""The Mask,""  ""The Blob""), and The Scorpion King more than ably meets those standards."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,63,Here is a movie that embraces its goofiness like a Get Out of Jail Free card.
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,63,"Within the limitations of the genre, the film succeeds fairly well, with enough giddy sophomoric humor, stunning fights, titillating sex, and exotic sets and costumes to keep an audience entertained."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,60,"The film is dumb, formulaic, the other actors are scarcely worth mentioning, and the plot is merely an excuse to set up the action scenes. But it didnt bore me; The Rock is ceaselessly entertaining."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,60,"The movie itself is a live-action cartoon, a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,60,"The Rock manages to play both with a crude candor more genuine than the entertaining if contrived spectacle around him, and a surprising big-screen charisma and ease that makes him a natural-born screen hero."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,58,"Isn't incompetent; it's just plodding and obvious. If anything holds it together, it's The Rock's ironic ability to tread lightly, which the movie is neither fast nor inventive enough to recognize as different from the spirit of Arnold."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,58,"The good news about The Scorpion King is that The Rock turns out to be a charismatic, ingratiating screen presence."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,"For a movie with such a misplaced sense of history, The Scorpion King seems afraid to have more fun with its own stupidity."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,The style here is much more in the spirit of the smash and slash of the Conan movies than the banter and computer-generated monsters of the Mummy movies.
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,"It is possible to make an engaging action/adventure picture of this sort, but The Scorpion King isn't it. The movie isn't godawful, but it's far from inspired, and, as I sat through its 90 minute running length, I found my mind wandering."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,"Prototypical summer-movie fare, designed to be consumed, enjoyed, and forgotten all at once."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,"It's impossible to overstate how deeply dumb all of this is, but it skims along at a brisk clip and manages not to overdo the nudge-nudge, wink-wink humor."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,"Of course, The Rock looks the part, though with a headband and buckskin, he'd also look like Tonto on steroids."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,"A dumb movie, but it's also a knowing one: a cheap castle of lewd trivia and corny excitement built on The Rock."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,"The Rock isn't always comfortable delivering dialogue. He's handsome, physically sculpted and farther along dramatically than Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Conan the Barbarian,"" but he's still learning the simple acting skills an action hero needs."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,Plays like Abbott and Costello Meet Conan the Barbarian.
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,40,"Bang-bang, kiss-kiss, yawn-yawn. While dull death metal churns on the soundtrack, Johnson engages in one big brawl after another."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,38,"Director Chuck Russell lacks the visual panache, the comic touch, and perhaps the budget of Sommers's title-bout features, which refined a historically grounded B-movie sensibility into pure, gasp-inducing entertainment."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,33,"The movie doesn't stink exactly, but it comes dispiritingly close."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,30,"Ultimately undone by its sheer busyness. The screenwriters never get the story to settle down, and it becomes a case of one damn thing after another."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,30,"Unfortunately, Scorpion King has none of the qualities -- epic sweep, relative originality and heartfelt bloodthirstiness -- that made ""Conan"" so trashily entertaining."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,30,"For all the swords 'n' sandals hoodoo that makes up the wilting backbone of Jonathan Hale's script, the Rock is, nevertheless, fun to keep an eye on."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,25,"As this chaotic barrage of muscle flexing, swordplay, fireballs, crude digital effects and comic-book quips hurls itself off the screen, it's like having several garbage cans clogged with stale pizza, lukewarm cola, soggy French fries and greasy, ketchup-stained napkins emptied over your head."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,100,"The Karate Kid was one of the nice surprises of 1984 -- an exciting, sweet-tempered, heart-warming story with one of the most interesting friendships in a long time."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,90,"John G. Avildsen is back in the Rocky ring with The Karate Kid. More precisely, it is a Rocky for kids. Morita is simply terrific, bringing the appropriate authority and wisdom to the part."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,80,"Though shamelessly manipulative, it is undeniably effective. It offers some genuine moments of warmth, humor and excitement. Of course it all leads up to a big tournament where Fair Play has a showdown with Dirty Tricks. Guess who wins. This is the kind of movie where you find yourself cheering even though you know you're being hoodwinked."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,75,"The Karate Kid might have been more endurable, maybe even endearing, if its runtime had been trimmed of a solid 30 minutes."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,75,"Ralph Macchio's transformation from high school geek to butt-kicking tough guy, thanks to a little help from Chinese sage Mr. Miyagi (Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita) and his homespun Oriental wisdom, is entertaining enough."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,63,"When karate is not being treated as the latest excuse for an Impossible Dream success story, and when the film is able to find more in Daniel's martial-arts career than pure Rocky-esque competitiveness, The Karate Kid exhibits warmth and friendly, predictable humor, its greatest assets."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,60,"As in the Rocky films, Avildsen's only directorial strategy is to delay the final confrontation for so long that all the audience's pent-up frustration explodes with it. It's primitive, predatory stuff."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,60,"In short, The Karate Kid presents the smallest imaginable variations on three well-tested formulas for movie success. Robert Mark Kamen's script is developed with maddening predictability, and John G. Avildsen's direction is literal and ambling. Films like this are what the PG rating is supposed to be all about."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,60,"This is actually director Avildsen's first hit since Rocky, and it has the same mixture of calculation and apparent naïveté. It borrows its formula from both East and West with good humour, and is completely free of intelligence, discrimination and originality. No wonder it's a hit."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,100,Best movie of the summer.
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,90,One of the best entertainments this season has yet offered.
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,90,"It blends tension and emotion, computer wizardry and dramatic skill in a vigorous climax--and the most impressive, haunting final shot of the movie year."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,88,"An amiable mix of ""Grumpy Old Men"" comedy and ""Apollo 13"" can-we-fix-this-jalopy-before-we-die? Drama."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,88,"Expertly directed, acted and written crowd-pleaser."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,88,Ends up working like a charm.
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,80,An entertainingly raffish action-comedy.
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,80,This is a mostly genial film that gets as much mileage as it can out of the undeniable charisma of its stars.
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,80,"Eastwood provides more than an hour of easygoing fun, followed by 45 minutes of action and suspense."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,80,"It proves that male action stars can triumph not only over space but, more important, over time."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,80,"It's a rare pleasure to see these senior citizens given so much screen time, droopy butts and all."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,80,The special effects are beautifully handled and the reflections on death attractively peaceful.
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,80,"Good escapist entertainment, and the effect is ingratiating."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,80,"The movie itself, like these guys, is defiantly old school -- confident, relaxed, professional."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,75,"From both sides of the camera, Eastwood works the crowd better than he has in years."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,75,"The stuff in outer space is unexpected, the surprise waiting out there is genuine, and meanwhile, there's an abundance of charm and screen presence from the four veteran actors."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,75,Preposterous to the extreme.
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,75,The joy of Space Cowboys is in spending quality time with some favorite old actors who obviously enjoy working together.
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,75,Arrives as a balm to seared adult psyches that have endured all manner of assaults at the multiplex this season.
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,75,I guess there's something grizzled old codgers like Clint can teach those young hotshots after all.
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,75,"The story takes a while to get started, but the acting is lively, the special effects are snazzy."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,74,He's (Eastwood) made a mature film that bests nearly all of the summer's highly touted blockbusters for pure escapism.
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,70,"The filmmaker has given us two films for the price of one. Unfortunately, the second film, a gripping thriller which occupies the last 45 minutes of Space Cowboys, is much better and more involving than the first film."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,70,A lighthearted action adventure starring four of the most likable guys on the planet.
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,67,"Poorly engineered: lurchingly paced, the dramatic conflicts duct taped together."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,67,"An affable, entertaining and poignant experience of the sort not normally afforded by space movies."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,67,An enormously satisfying corndog of a movie.
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,65,"The part that caters to older fans is funny and satisfying, if unbelievable. The part that plays to action-movie devotees is muddled, unsatisfying and unbelievable. Luckily, the first part is about two-thirds of the movie."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,63,"Enjoyably preposterous, old-guys-are-cool-too plot."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,63,Space Cowboys does achieve liftoff.
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,63,I really wish a younger man than Clint Eastwood had directed it.
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,60,"If only this amiable shaggy dog story...didn't degenerate into an implausible, second-rate thriller after takeoff."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,50,"Although his (Eastwood's) intentions are good, he simply isn't capable of the wry, wistful blend of humor and sadness this story desperately needs."
Space Cowboys,6.4,90464773,50,"An implausible action adventure with the most geriatric payload since a community of retirees lifted off in ""Cocoon."""
RED,7.1,90380162,80,"Even the more cartoonish performances, like John Malkovich's acid-damaged paranoiac, fit the movie's vision of the vanished, wild-and-woolly heyday of spycraft."
RED,7.1,90380162,80,"Red isn't a great movie, but it's great fun, and if that sounds like damning with faint praise, you take things too seriously."
RED,7.1,90380162,75,One of those rare action comedies that actually delivers action and comedy.
RED,7.1,90380162,75,"It's a lot of fun and, because of the high quality of the cast, there's no need to feel guilty about praising such an inherently silly motion picture."
RED,7.1,90380162,75,"Red isn't edifying, ennobling, or artful.  It's just an utterly satisfying combination of big kicks, cheap thrills and real laughs."
RED,7.1,90380162,75,"This breezy action comedy is a noisy affirmation that life goes on after 50, that retirement doesn't mean redundancy, and that nobody - young or old - can wear a long cream evening gown like Mirren."
RED,7.1,90380162,75,The result is like a sugar rush after a visit to the vintage candy store.
RED,7.1,90380162,75,Red has more snappy joy in store than practically all of last summer's busted blockbusters.
RED,7.1,90380162,75,RED is so much fun -- and its Over the Hill Gang so likeable -- that this is one of those rare cases where I wouldn't mind seeing them come out of retirement again for another romp.
RED,7.1,90380162,70,"All those guys are a blast, and the dark-hearted idiocy of Red is mostly quite enjoyable."
RED,7.1,90380162,70,The best part of Red is the spectacle of terrific actors being terrific in novel ways.
RED,7.1,90380162,70,"Only a curmudgeon could entirely resist the laid-back charms of Red, an amusing, light-footed caper about a team of aging CIA veterans rudely forced out of retirement."
RED,7.1,90380162,70,Not the best. Not the worst. Just the classiest.
RED,7.1,90380162,70,To underestimate actors of this caliber -- even in a popcorn action flick -- would be dangerous indeed.
RED,7.1,90380162,70,"Part of it is cheap thrills, of course; this is a capable, experienced cast with extensive acting chops, and it's trashy fun watching them descend to the level of the material."
RED,7.1,90380162,67,"It's an amusing geriatric uprising that might just as well be titled ""Gray."""
RED,7.1,90380162,67,"RED is a poisoned valentine to the CIA, and that approach, too, is in keeping with its cold-war sentimentality."
RED,7.1,90380162,67,"There's no denying the kick you get from seeing Borgnine (forever lovelorn Marty to me, when he's not tooling around my head as Cabbie, from John Carpenter's Escape From New York) and company kick ass, take names, and go batshit crazy one last time."
RED,7.1,90380162,67,"Red starts repeating itself and spinning its wheels and looking for an ending, well before the ending arrives. The actors have considerable fun with it, though."
RED,7.1,90380162,63,"Too long, too busy, too loud, and too reliant on slam-bang stunt work, Red's glib dialogue and sinister government scenarios begin to wear."
RED,7.1,90380162,63,"Unlike ""Wild Hogs"" or last summer's ""The Expendables,"" this adaptation of the ""Red"" graphic novel series gets into a cool, sophisticated swing."
RED,7.1,90380162,63,"Red has enough acting flourishes and incidental action pleasures to make it an adrenalin-jacked giggle, if not exactly the romp one so fervently expects."
RED,7.1,90380162,63,Excels at bringing on the high-power pyrotechnics.
RED,7.1,90380162,63,"Good fun, and though it breathes hard in the second half, the ensemble has charisma to spare."
RED,7.1,90380162,60,"The film preserves many of Ellis's amoral one liners (best delivered by Malkovich and by Richard Dreyfuss as one of the villains), though as in much of his writing, the fun is discolored by a profound cynicism."
RED,7.1,90380162,60,"It's the casting, stupid!"
RED,7.1,90380162,60,"Unfortunately, while RED's stars may have gotten better with age, its many clichés have not."
RED,7.1,90380162,58,"""The Expendables"" trotted out the concept this summer, and it was good dumb fun - a nudge-nudge wink-wink '80s movie on steroids. RED is more self-consciously wacky, more stridently in your face, and more disappointing."
RED,7.1,90380162,50,"Red can't stop itself from trying too hard to be hip. It's not that it doesn't have effective moments, it's that it doesn't have as many as it thinks it does. The film's inescapable air of glib self-satisfaction is not only largely unearned, it's downright irritating."
RED,7.1,90380162,50,"Red is an insult to our memories and to our intelligence, an unfunny farce whose veteran cast is cashing a retirement check."
RED,7.1,90380162,50,"It is possible to have a good time at RED, but it is not a very good movie."
RED,7.1,90380162,50,"The uneven humor, half-baked plot and generic action scenes keep RED from being much fun."
RED,7.1,90380162,50,Red simultaneously tries too hard and not hard enough.
RED,7.1,90380162,50,"The star turns are Red's raison d'être, with the winking performances filling the place of any credible dramatic tension."
RED,7.1,90380162,50,Red is neither a good movie nor a bad one. It features actors we like doing things we wish were more interesting.
RED,7.1,90380162,50,"No one is expected to take any of this seriously, so Schwentke keeps things light: light on big laughs, light on unique action set pieces and light on any sense that these game but retired spies are too old for this crap."
RED,7.1,90380162,40,"The movie doesn’t have a funny bone in its body, clomping from one unoriginal set piece to the next with a head-scratching lack of urgency."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,75,"Terminator Genisys fires on all action cylinders when director Alan Taylor (Thor: The Dark World) follows the model James Cameron set in the first two films, still the glory of the series."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,75,"The best one-liners, like the best fight scenes, are reserved for Schwarzenegger.  It's too soon to tell whether Terminator Genisys will have a catch phrase like ""I'll be back"" or ""Hasta la vista, baby"" but there are several candidates. Much of the film's comedy results from The Terminator's failed attempts to emulate human behavior."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,75,"What’s remarkable is that this fifth Terminator is worthwhile precisely because of its franchise cash-in excessiveness. It’s at once an eminently satisfying actioner, jackknifing tractor-trailers and vertiginous helicopter chases and all, as it is a passably thought-provoking comment on memory – headily engaging with the very nostalgia it intends to evoke."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,67,"This new Terminator, the first since the dreadfully dreary and Arnold-less ""Salvation,"" is engineered to feel at once eerily familiar and raise-the-stakes fresh."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,63,"Genisys goes back to what made the franchise work in the first place: not the machine inside the man, but vice versa."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,60,"Fresh cast, fresh ideas and full-on action gives Taylor’s reboot momentum, even if an overloaded script threatens to topple it at times. Doesn’t touch Cameron’s two movies, of course."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,60,"Genisys is more entertaining than the last two installments, although it's not nearly as good as the first two."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,60,"Terminator Genisys is a reasonably entertaining and niftily executed sci-fi action-thriller, and yet its ingenuity and craftsmanship are all in service of justifying its existence, resulting in a sequel that can be appreciated for its cleverness but otherwise regarded with a certain amount of ambivalence."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,58,"Terminator: Genisys isn't so much a sequel or a reboot but a piece of fan fiction come to ludicrous, big-budget life. Even for an unnecessary entry in a series of movies about indestructible time-traveling robots and genocidal computer networks, it's pretty silly."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"The ultra-tangled plotline of Terminator Genisys makes the rhythm of the action beats especially weird; we see the entire world nuked into rubble by the machine overlords really early in the movie, which makes it hard to get excited about a few buildings falling down later on."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"Schwarzenegger has turned into your elderly uncle, dancing like a goofball at your wedding after a couple glasses of champagne. He knows he’s being silly, and he knows that you know, and that alone is supposed to be good for a laugh. But it’s not. It’s just sad. He has essentially become McBain."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"This mash-up movie is like a greatest-hits collection for obsessive collectors. On its own terms, Terminator Genisys makes virtually no sense."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"For all its weaknesses, Terminator Genisys is a ""Terminator"" movie that feels like a ""Terminator"" movie, more than did ""Terminator 3,"" not to mention the ghastly ""Terminator Salvation."""
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"The best thing in the movie is Schwarzenegger, who delivers the Guardian’s lines with perfect timing and creates an empathetic character, because as we know, nearly all the best movie robots somehow become just a little bit human as time goes on."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"""I'll be back,"" the man said, and he kept the promise, but I'm not sure we wanted him back like this."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"[JK Simmons] provides a little comic relief, and sums up my feelings on this whole outing: “Goddamn time-travelin’ robots!”"
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"The fifth installment of the Terminator series cannot overcome the weight of its convoluted time travel leaps, its strained attempts at injecting twists everywhere, a clunky opening, and a painfully clumsy finish."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"Someone describes the T-800 as ""nothing but a relic from a deleted timeline."" Too harsh to lay on Schwarzenegger yet, but certainly it applies to the Terminator franchise."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,42,"Schwarzenegger, weathered and ironic, strides through the film with old-fashioned authority. Except for Clarke, who walks an ambiguous line between heroism and sinister monomania, only Big Arnie leaves the slightest impression after the credits roll."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,42,"The story isn’t just confusing, it’s a betrayal to anyone who’s invested brain cells in the Terminatorverse over the past 31 years."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"Terminator Genisys' ambition overrides sense and depth in the pursuit of a new direction, and then unwittingly proves how little life there is left in this franchise."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"Director Alan Taylor handles the big action adeptly as he did in Thor The Dark World, but the script is an ever-decreasing cycle of tool-ups, chase sequences and daft monologues."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"Genisys is all bullets and bombs, action without pause, as though if the ride stops the whole thing will collapse under its own weight."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"In practice, the interplay between events old and new is equal parts tedious and indecipherable, with the characters talking about parallel timelines like studio executives thrashing out a franchise in a boardroom."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"Salvation was boring, but Genisys makes you sad. Risk-averse Hollywood has made a crash-test dummy of a once great franchise, simply throwing everything at it to see what it stands."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"Fans hoping to watch Schwarzenegger growl his catchphrases with a slight edge of shtick are underestimating the patience involved in sitting through a two-hour slog. As for those who want a little apocalyptic tension or (dare to dream) romance, this new model is not for you. It’s the Skynet cut."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"The setpieces, in addition to mostly rehashing better scenes from earlier films, feel thrown together to serve the effects, and the effects look far less astonishing than anything in Cameron’s first two films."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"The stunts and CGI and attendant action scenes are all simply fine; there’s nothing here with the stark simple power of “The Terminator” or the strong-but-strange brilliant inventions of “Terminator 2.” Instead, it’s all less-than-spectacular “spectacle” and plot convolutions twisting around themselves at the whim of the summer’s least interesting killer artificial intelligence."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"For all its initial playfulness, the script never rises to the level of surreal, cortex-tickling pleasure it seems to be aiming for, and for all its self-awareness it’s weirdly devoid of humor."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,38,Terminator Genisys feels like being trapped in a conversation with a child breathlessly recounting the highlights of the preceding movies.
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,38,"Terminator used to be a sci-fi franchise defined by its cool time-travel concept and even better special effects. Unfortunately, it's ""Hasta la vista, baby,"" to those good old days."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,38,Everything's at stake yet nothing comes to much in Terminator Genisys.
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,30,"It doesn’t jell, though, and the movie’s philosophical message is especially grating."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,30,Terminator: Genisys is a catastrophic misfire on nearly all counts. It’s only saving grace? 2015 Oscar winner J.K. Simmons (Whiplash) as a Mulder-gone-to-pot-esque cop who believes in these “goddamn time-traveling robots.”
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,30,Terminator Genisys could be Exhibit A in why the current line of thinking in Hollywood regarding sequels/reboots/remakes often leads to terrible decisions and worse films.
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,30,"It’s amusing to see identical Arnolds clash like titans, but nobody here seems to have fully grasped that they had another heavyweight in Mr. Clarke."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,30,"Action scenes are accumulated as if mandated by a stop-watch and almost invariably seem like warmed-over versions of stuff we've seen before, in Terminator entries and elsewhere."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,25,"When you’ve already put two sequels to this atrocity into the pre-production pipeline… Maybe you should stop. Or maybe the rest of us, the movie-going, sci-fi loving, “Terminator” adoring public have to be the ones to say it. “This ends here.”"
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,25,"There is nothing about Terminator: Genisys that suggests that this film was a compelling, urgent, essential dream for anyone involved. This is all about squeezing cash out of people who are fond of the original films, calculated and without any of the soul of Cameron's films."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,20,"One achievement of James Cameron’s “Terminator” is that it overcame its low-rent, B-movie trappings. The great sin of “Genisys” is that it costs millions and yet isn’t worth a dime."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,10,What could anyone have said of the finished film except that it was finished? Terminator Genisys plays like the worst of all outcomes.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,100,"A tense, concise and elegantly shot film."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,88,"The movie's excellence comes from Foster's performance as a resourceful and brave woman; from Bean, Sarsgaard and the members of the cabin crew, all with varying degrees of doubt; from the screenplay by Peter A. Dowling and Billy Ray; and from the direction by Robert Schwentke."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,88,"For at least two-thirds of its length, all elements combine for a taut thriller, a Hitchcockian exercise in suspense pitting human frailty - can our minds be trusted? - against human resourcefulness."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,83,Far-fetched but deliciously exciting aerial nail-biter.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,70,"Until those final moments, Flightplan succeeds admirably, both as a sophisticated psychological thriller and as an example of, if not great art, then superb craftsmanship."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,70,"Has a routine finish but up to that point is a more than decent thriller--or, given its taut self-containment, a more than decent Hitchcockian ""exercise in suspense."""
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,63,"Jodie Foster's fiercely intelligent performance drives this disappointing thriller, whose taut, carefully constructed first half is sadly negated by its implausible and -- worst of all -- unengaging conclusion."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,63,Doesn't have its heroine's conviction. It'd be better if it had.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,60,This thriller is effective if you can accept that--as with some of John Dickson Carr's locked-room mysteries--the trickiness counts more than any plausibility.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,60,"Schwentke handles the claustrophobic environment efficiently enough, though he dallies too long before letting anxiety give way to action."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,60,Becomes more satisfying than the stock thriller–star vehicle it begins and ends as.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,60,"An enthralling, enjoyable if ultimately far-fetched thriller."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,58,A thriller that goes from pretty good to absolutely ludicrous in the time it takes one actor to recite about four sentences of dialogue.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,58,"Since Foster plays warming-up-for-a-straitjacket panic with a clenched intensity rare to behold in a Hollywood actress, I, for one, was rooting for the radical -- that is, nuthouse -- option."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"But coming on the heels of ""Red Eye,"" which is nothing if not an efficient thrill machine, Flightplan can only look conspicuously flat by comparison."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"A thriller of passive virtues, the steely intensity of Jodie Foster notwithstanding. It's not too violent. It's not assaultive. Even James Horner's music plays it cool."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"Sean Bean makes a positive impression as the caring but puzzled captain of the flight, though Peter Sarsgaard flies at half-mast as a clumsy air marshal."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"Despite excellent elements - great actress, taut plot, slick visuals - Flightplan is like airplane food. No matter how good the ingredients the air chef has to work with, the entree inevitably ends up tasting like a Xerox of a facsimile of a meal."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,The latest motion picture to take an intriguing premise and flush it into the septic tank.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"To watch Ms. Foster storm through a phony airplane for an entire movie has its very minor pleasures - given the numerous close-ups, you can study her lovely face at your leisure - but there is nothing here to feed the head or fray the nerves."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,The movie loses some of its initial atmospheric tension as paranoid thrills give way to Rambo high jinks.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"There is something really nasty about this cold, calculating exercise in mob psychology and human venality."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"This B-list thriller portrays air crews as inept, at best, and callous and cruel at worst."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,Largely undone by a script that self-destructs in the third act of an otherwise well-made thriller.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"The plot is contingent on everything going perfectly in ways no one can possibly predict, right down to the most outlandish happenstance of timing and human behavior."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"By the final act, involving possibly the most far-fetched scheme since Dr. Evil aimed his death ray at Earth in ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,"" the indifference has become completely contagious."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"I'd like to say that Flightplan is one of those white-knuckle, edge-of-your-seat thrill rides that critics are always raving about, but instead, it's more like a transatlantic flight with no clear destination, where the cabin noise makes it impossible to sleep and the in-flight movie is a rerun."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"As it is, Flightplan is half of a pretty good movie. But to maintain that impression, I recommend you take a nap for the last 40 minutes."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,40,Flightplan should have remained grounded for repairs.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,40,"An exercise in edgy tedium, and even though it's only 90 minutes or so, it seems to last longer than an actual transatlantic flight. If you bring an eye mask and a few sleeping pills, you should get through it OK. A magazine or book wouldn't hurt, either. It'll be over before you know it."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,40,"As the movie enters its final chapter, you will come to the sad, sickening realization that the filmmakers have played you for a chump. What seemed so smart, so well crafted and finely tuned, falls apart into a flaming heap of c---, and all goodwill is dashed."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,38,Absurdity has a new name: Flightplan.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,25,"This movie demands that the viewer -- and even its own characters -- turn into thumb-sucking 3-year-olds with no need for plausibility or logic, as long as there are lots of flashing lights and whooshing noises emanating from the screen."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,90,A pretty damn good summer movie.
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,75,"The script doesn't do a great job with either the spiritual or the physical trek, but the spectacular action sequences occur with enough regularity that strong writing isn't necessary to keep Waterworld afloat."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,75,Costner's surfer-bum affectlessness works here; he turns the Mariner into the world's most jaded lifeguard.
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,75,"A two hour aquatic pursuit pic with bruising stunts, fun-to-watch performances, a dozen good chortles and imposing Panavision renderings of post-apocalyptic crud, Waterworld clearly has the makings of a cult movie."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,75,"If the story seems a little waterlogged, it's still big, loud, and fun to watch."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,70,"Nowhere near the Hollywood disaster that was foretold, Waterworld is a near-model summer fantasy: two hours and 21 minutes of loud, expansive fun."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,67,"A decent futuristic action picture with some great sets, some intriguing ideas, and a few images that will stay with me."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,63,"A not-bad futuristic actioner with three or four astounding sequences, an unusual hero, a nifty villain and less mythic and romantic resonance than might be desired."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,60,"Waterworld isn't ""Fishtar,"" but Kevin Costner's pricey, post-apocalyptic sloshbuckler isn't a seafaring classic either."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,"Its mediocrity guarantees this lavish, soggy retread of futuristic Australian action classic ""The Road Warrior"" a place in the ranks of forgotten extravaganzas."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,It's really not bad... It's a genuine vault at greatness that misses the mark -- but survives.
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,Sublimely ridiculous.
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,At least Dennis Hopper plays the bad guy with wildness and wit. Costner's stolid hero seems a washout by comparison.
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,"Though Waterworld has some haunting underwater visual moments, the film's impact is weakened by flat dialogue, an overemphasis on jokeyness and a plot that, despite all those screenwriters, does not satisfactorily hold together at any number of points."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,This movie feels like it was made by a bank rather than a person.
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,88,"Fresh and delightfully offbeat, The Accountant proves that a thriller can be complex and nuanced while fulfilling its mission to entertain."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,88,"The premise of accountant as action hero might seem absurd, but The Accountant makes it credible and fascinating."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,88,"Madness abounds in The Accountant, an intense, intricate, darkly amusing and action-infused thriller that doesn’t always add up but who cares, it’s BIG FUN."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,80,"The Accountant is a nifty piece of genre entertainment, its wacky edge and genial tone despite that body count coming as something of a pleasant surprise in a year rife with lumbering, over-amped blockbusters."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,75,"The thing that makes The Accountant unique, however, and elevates it above the garden variety action-thriller, is that the title character’s “superpowers” result from his autism."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,75,"The victory of The Accountant is in the tone. The title character isn’t presented as a superfreak – this isn’t ""Rain Man,"" in which autistic gifts are presented as powers for parlour tricks – but as a prototype and a beautiful mutant, maybe even a superhero."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,75,"On the whole, it's a mess of action clichés built on top of a shaky premise that's so out-of-this-world that it'll either enrage you - or make you laugh. I chose the latter. I'm not ashamed to admit that I had a lot of fun at this movie."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,75,"One of the opening scenes of The Accountant consists of puzzle pieces being dumped on a table, and that’s a fine metaphor for the film.... A few pieces can’t be made to fit, and two of those are big ones. (More on that in a minute.) But the rest of the story has been well-constructed, and the picture it gradually reveals keeps you guessing up to the final scene."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,75,Ben Affleck brings needed nuance to old-fashioned brains and brawn as an action hero with high-functioning autism in The Accountant.
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,70,An effective and even affecting pop thriller.
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,70,The Accountant is nothing if not a puzzle — not so much a jigsaw as a three-dimensional brain teaser that gets deeper and stranger with each new revelation.
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,70,"Audiences willing to just go with the movie’s outlandish lead character will find laughs and thrills along the way, as well as that rarest of studio properties: a tentpole that actually leaves you enthusiastic about the prospect of a sequel."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,67,"For every moment that feels overly self-serious, there are two that promise this thing’s some kind of pop-schlock classic."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,63,"True to the profession it sets out to glamorize, The Accountant takes advantage of its share of creative loopholes — and manages to break even in the process."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,63,"The Accountant keeps you hanging on all the way to the looney-toon ending, well past the point where your higher brain functions have called it a night. It’s not a good movie but it’s not a bad way to kill a few hours."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,60,"The action-thriller The Accountant is laughable, but when you’re not laughing at it, you’re laughing with it. It’s enjoyable enough."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,60,"The problem is that endings matter. I was thrilled at watching more than an hour of Ben Affleck playing Christian Wolff as a socially awkward, arithmetically gifted, martial arts expert sharpshooter. But then the plot devolved into nonsense for the final stretch, leaving me wanting to garnish the filmmakers' wages."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,60,"The world-building is engrossing. The premise is refreshingly peculiar. The action grabs your attention. As long as the movie keeps a lid on what precisely is going on, it works."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,60,"All the more frustrating because of its conceptual freshness and Ben Affleck's sly turn in the title role, this sleek action thriller ends up delivering standard shoot-'em-up goods after initially suggesting it might provide something rather different."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,58,"The whole thing’s ludicrous, down to the last loony twist, but it’s also a lot more fun than Batman v Superman."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"The Accountant is so many baffling things, most (but not all) of which can not be described in a positive manner."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"Thrillers can be a valid Hollywood escape, but this one made me as uncomfortable as its hero is with small talk."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"The Accountant would be more entertaining if it just acknowledged its own nerdy outlandishness. Still, it’s something to watch Affleck play a man who has trouble expressing his feelings and struggles to read those of others."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"I admit I would've had a hard time getting through it without the help of Simmons and Addai-Robinson, over there in the B plot. The character at the center of the story is treated with respect and admiration, but in dramatic terms he's about as real-world plausible as Batman."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"It goes very far south, with two plot reveals that are among the most ludicrous that I’ve experienced in quite some time."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"Much of it is enjoyable and has the aura of a superior action film, but it collapses into a laughable wreck and ultimately reveals itself as a mild waste of two hours."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"The script, by Bill Dubuque, goes sideways in a hurry. Characters do inexplicable things for no reason other than advancing the plot, and sometimes not even that. There is a jaw-dropping coincidence that is as ridiculous as it is obvious."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"At various times, The Accountant aspires to a slick corporate-espionage thriller, a no-nonsense action flick, a tortured family drama, a quirky romantic comedy, and an earnest PSA about autism. At nearly all times, it’s preposterous."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"Conceptually, The Accountant kills it, but in terms of execution, The Accountant doesn’t add up."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"For all its respectable airs, The Accountant mostly induces shrugs. Sometimes, B-movies fare better when they settle for being their lowbrow selves."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"Director Gavin O’Connor (“Warrior”) is at a loss in trying to shape this into a lean, chilly action picture. The fights and shootouts work, some of the accounting stuff is funny, but the rest is a muddle."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"The latest from director Gavin O’Connor (Warrior) is part character study and part airport-novel nonsense, and the film’s utter chutzpah gives the proceedings an agreeable kick. But The Accountant can’t balance its B-movie instincts with its more artistic aspirations, ultimately hamstringing a potentially juicy, escapist shoot-‘em-up."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"Seemingly primed to deliver daffy thrills, The Accountant instead goes about its noble-killer business with all the excitement of an IRS audit."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"The film juggles a “follow the money” procedural with corporate espionage thriller, producing two competing tones that never reconcile into one fluid narrative."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,42,"Director Gavin O’Connor and screenwriter Bill Dubuque have made a textbook example of the ""what were they thinking?"" movie genre. Judging from the befogged look on some of the actors’ faces, they must have been wondering the same thing."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,42,"While “Jason Bourne meets Temple Grandin” might sound like an interesting idea for a studio write-off, “James Bond meets Michael Clayton meets Rain Man meets all of their friends and enemies” is a dull movie that’s too full of distractions to pay out any dividends."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,40,The one thing there’s no accounting for in The Accountant is taste.
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,40,"Character motivations are glossed over, explanatory scenes are jammed in haphazardly, and the finale relies on a tonally bizarre combination of schmaltz, coincidence and violence that seems to betray the arc of the whole movie."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,40,"The Accountant uses a cliched and misleading presentation of disability to produce a cliched Hollywood action lead in a cliched action plot, and then babbles cliches about the importance of embracing difference. Despite its protestations to the contrary, the only thing that sets The Accountant apart from its peers is its irritating, clueless hypocrisy, and its lousy title."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,33,The Accountant tallies up its numbers for an achingly long 50 minutes before it starts to finally piece together any semblance of a structured plot.
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,30,Here's two hours of grimly serious puzzle-box dramatics and beat-downs starring Ben Affleck as an Affleck-shaped void.
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,30,"The movie, directed by Gavin O’Connor (“Tumbleweeds”), makes little sense. The screenplay, by Bill Dubuque, is so determined to hide its cards that when the big reveal finally arrives, it feels as underwhelming as it is preposterous."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,25,"Preposterous can be defined in many, many ways. But for now, let's use the plot details of The Accountant as Exhibit A."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,25,"Ben Affleck is Agent Double-OCD in The Accountant, an effortlessly dumb thriller barely more entertaining than an audit."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,20,"The Dark Knight director has had a mortifying effect on movies. In this case, it’s almost as if Affleck’s somber plunge into the calamitous, Nolan-produced ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" has followed him into other projects, like a heavy cologne. Avoid this one like the stink it is."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,88,"Blissfully entertaining sequel to last year's Spy Kids, Rodriguez is once again just as good -- if not better -- than the gadgets at hand."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,88,"Like a whacked pinata, it spills over with treasures - and one of the best things to fall out is Steve Buscemi, doing a riotously meek variation on the mad-scientist-with-cracked-lenses-and-lab-coat bit."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,80,"The Cortez family flies into action with the same testy family dynamics, silly humor and cool gadgetry that animated the first Spy Kids."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,80,"Though it's longer and more elaborate than it needs to be, it shares its predecessor's smart but relaxed sense of humor, a sophisticated imagination and the ability to be sharp and playful without being malicious."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,80,The rare sequel that magnifies the scope of the original without diminishing the fun.
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,80,"The movie is a gaudy, noisy thrill ride -- hyperactive, slightly out of control and full of kinetic, mischievous charm."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,80,"Rodriguez is that rare filmmaker who doesn't draw a hard, fixed line between entertaining kids and grown-ups -- he knows that in order to understand what will delight kids, you have to know what will tickle adults as well."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,80,"Rodriguez knows kids. No doubt kids will be clamoring to get acquainted with Spy Kids 2, the best sequel to emerge from a children’s franchise in the past several years."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,78,"This is joyful filmmaking, imbued with an infectious, giddy enthusiasm."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,75,"Though slightly lacking in the warmth of the first, should no doubt please audiences."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,75,"The whole film has a lively Mexican-American tilt, from the Hispanic backgrounds of the young actors to the surprise appearance of none other than Ricardo Montalban, as Grandpa, in a wheelchair with helicopter capabilities."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,75,The inventiveness is still superior and the network of fiends and family is extended.
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,75,A children's movie done with genuinely youthful spirit and an easy self-kidding mastery of its own high-tech gadgetry.
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,75,It's a wonderfully silly family movie that holds its audience in high regard.
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,75,Has enough heart and smarts to recommend it as one of the season's worthier family entertainments.
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,75,"Has once again caught lightning in a bottle and unleashed it on audiences, blending humor, adventure, and a lot of nifty special effects-enabled gadgets and creatures into a movie that provides 1 1/2 hours of unfettered entertainment for children, grandparents, and everyone in between."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,70,"The action is so relentless that after a while things start to feel hollow, but Rodriguez still seems to believe the moral articulated at the end of the first film -- that keeping a family together is the real adventure."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,70,"The moments of inspired originality are all too infrequent. There's enough eye candy and marvels on screen, however."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,67,"Rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid, and they come together to remake the world in the image of its young audience. It's more amusement park ride than adventure, which in this case is exactly the demographic he's reaching for."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,63,What's lacking is the simplicity that made the original.
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,60,"The poised Vega and pleasingly phlegmatic Sabara are resolutely uncute performers, and the reach-out-and-touch-it gadgetry carries a homey scent of proactive nostalgia. Spy Kids 2 is an island of lost Circuit Cities."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,50,Eye-catching and entertaining but less inspired than the original.
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,50,"To the delight of gadgetheads and the dismay of the rest of us, Spy Kids' paraphernalia is better developed and considerably more fun than its story."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,50,"There's way too much CGI gadgetry, some inventive, much simply flashy in the worst kind of video-game way. The kids are nearly lost in the glitz."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,50,"This time around, writer-director Robert Rodriguez has stumbled badly, creating a clunky, gadget-happy film full of characters -- even returning ones -- about whom it is hard to care."
Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,5.2,85846429,42,"One overly busy (not to mention shopworn) story, which regurgitates everything from H.G. Wells's ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" to the herky-jerky monsters of Ray Harryhausen to James Bond to ""The Mummy."""
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,91,"Real Steel is directed by ""Night at the Museum's"" Shawn Levy, who makes good use of his specialized skill in blending people and computer-made imaginary things into one lively, emotionally satisfying story."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,80,"There's a little ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" here, a dash of ""Transformers"" there, and it's all topped with big heap of ""Rocky."" But it's hard to argue with the results, because, at times, Real Steal is close to a knockout."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,"If you can get past the ridiculousness of the setup - easy to do, because the posters make it clear this isn't a Woody Allen movie - it's pretty much impossible not to have fun."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,The movie is corny enough to remind you that boxing rings are square.
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,"It is earsplitting, crowd-pleasing, and, no doubt, 'bot-pleasing, too. If you told me I would get emotionally and viscerally involved in two machines punching the hard drives out of each other, I would tell you you were crazy. I would be wrong."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,"By the time the two hour running length has expired, it's safe to say that Real Steel comes across as a legitimate crowd-pleaser."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,"Real Steel is a real movie. It has characters, it matters who they are, it makes sense of its action, it has a compelling plot. This is the sort of movie, I suspect, young viewers went to the ""Transformers"" movies looking for."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,"Like ""Moneyball,"" this is real movie making that packs a solid entertainment punch."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,70,"It goes through all the motions, properly and efficiently, and yet it's missing some core warmth. Watching Real Steel, I kept thinking of Brad Bird's retro-modern cartoon ""The Iron Giant,"" and of how that picture humanized a metal alien so effortlessly."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,70,"Although the marketing looks like ""Transformers 4,"" Real Steel is the real deal, a Rocky with robots that ought to have audiences standing up and cheering."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,70,The uncanny thing about Real Steel is just how gripping the fight scenes are; Sugar Ray Leonard served as a consultant to the motion-capture performers responsible for pantomiming the machines' moves.
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,67,"Real Steel falls somewhere near the intersection of elation and shame, essentially reworking the Sylvester Stallone arm-wrestling non-classic ""Over The Top"" for the equally ridiculous sport of android fisticuffs, and mostly getting away with it."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,63,"If familiarity is endemic to this feel-good drama, there's nonetheless also something to be said for competent amalgamation and regurgitation of tired genre tropes."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,60,"Rocky with robots? It's not quite in Balboa's weight class, but Real Steel at least has some heft. There's barely a story beat among the beat-downs that you won't expect, and sometimes the saccharine gets in the way of the spectacle, but on the whole this is enjoyable family entertainment."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,60,"When I was 7 and saw ""Over The Top,"" I saw no irony in its moniker, even during a slow-motion close-up of two battling hands. While Real Steel is similarly ludicrous, I predict it will play like a masterpiece with 7-year-olds."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,60,"As it happens, this recycled reclamation of underdogs saga is neither as bad as it sounds nor quite as good as it could be."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,60,"Based very loosely on a short story by ""I Am Legend"" author Richard Matheson, Real Steel in fact comes closer to road-bonding movies featuring children and hesitant papas: ""Paper Moon"" or ""Over the Top,"" say."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,60,"Executive-produced by Steven Spielberg, the movie's special effects are seamless and far more cleanly cut than any of Michael Bay's hash. But the element that lingers longest is a subtle strand - also woven into last week's ""Take Shelter"" - of recessionary anxiety."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,58,"Real Steel is sci-fi without the science, and the fiction is strictly 20th century, straight out of Rocky knockoffs."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"The story remains sadly mired in botdom, which leads to some boredom. It's hard to look away from the ever-dazzling Jackman, but the sight of him hunched over the controls of something akin to a live action video game is not, in the end, much more exciting than the sight of your average teenager hunched over the controls of a Game Boy."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"When making a film for 10-year-old boys, it doesn't have to be good, necessarily -- just good enough. And that's exactly what Real Steel is: good enough."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"What it lacks is the human element. Charlie is more of a rat than a rascal, and instead of working hard to build and operate his robots, he's literally going through the motions."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"They should call this overloud, underwhelming movie ""Real Steal."""
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"It's a combination that seems ideal for 10-year-old boys who adore violence, and could well be the cornerstone of the next DreamWorks franchise."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"It's an odd blend - a sentimental story in a futuristic world of brutal machine-maneuvered fights. There are some ringside thrills, but it's not a seamless mesh."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"An underdog drama with clanging metal-on-metal action, Real Steel feels scientifically programmed to claw at your heart while its battling robots, which have a semblance of human personality, drum up your adrenaline. That said, I'm not sure that the movie itself has more than a semblance of a heart."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"Sugar Ray Leonard helped with the motion-capture, and it shows. Good stuff. But the tear-jerking in Real Steel is as shameless as its product placement. We're being hustled."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"A slightly soggy tale of father-son bonding, crossed with an action-adventure flick about high-tech battle-bots."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,I suspect a lot of what I found synthetic and sort of galling in Real Steel will work just fine with the target audience.
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"Lost's Evangeline Lilly remains lost, however, in this film role as Charlies's too-good-to-be-true romantic interest."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"Jackman gamely does his best,  Levy keeps the kid just shy of insufferable and just this side of kid-appropriate in his behavior and language."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,This punishingly predictable tale will test whether sci-fi action fanboys can stomach having their cherished genre infiltrated by sentimental hokum about a down-on-his-luck dad and his spunky long-lost son.
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,40,"In either a stunningly brave or misguided act of meta-absurdity, Real Steel, which is about a boy, his dad and the robot that changes their lives, actually feels as if it were made inside the mind of a kid obsessed with robots."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,38,"Real Steel is to action what the Anthony Weiner habit was to sex: It's so virtual, so distant from the thrill, that you wonder what the point is. Do you really want to pay to watch an actor playing a kid who in turn plays what amounts to a video game?"
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"Though Aliens is unable to eschew some obvious sci-fi conventions and those of other genres as well, it brings a fresh and lively spirit to this tired cinematic clime. Scene to scene, encounter to encounter, its tension builds unrelentingly. So, fasten your seat belts. It`s a blast."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"Aliens is one of the most intensely shocking films to open in ages: Even if you think you've got the stamina for cinematic suspense, you may find yourself out in the lobby, midway, catching your breath. This film is also the best monster movie of the year and the best picture of any kind to open so far this summer. Put it another way: Aliens is the Jaws of the '80s."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"A nonstop, high-tech, souped-up war movie, with gung ho marines blasting special-effects creatures, and a genuinely convincing, exciting action heroine."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"Tautly paced and expertly directed, this roller coaster ride of a motion picture offers a little bit of everything, all wrapped up in a tidy science fiction/action package."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"For this movie stands to be something its predecessor was not, a megahit. And it deserves to be, for it is a remarkable accomplishment: a sequel that exceeds its predecessor in the reach of its appeal while giving Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,Truly great cinema- manages to dodge that 'dodgy sequel' curse with ease.
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"There is always an interesting tension in Cameron's work between masculine and feminine qualities. When it finally hits the fan here, we're in for the mother of all battles."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,I'm giving the movie a high rating for its skill and professionalism and because it does the job it says it will do. I am also advising you not to eat before you go to see it.
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"But of all the film's choices, the best was Weaver. She's its white-hot core, given fine, irascible dialogue to come blazing out of that patrician mouth, and the chance to look, for a moment, like a space-dusted Sleeping Beauty in her hyper-sleep casket."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,90,Director James Cameron dumps the decorative effects of Ridley Scott's 1979 Alien in favor of some daring narrative strategies and a tight thematic focus.
Aliens,8.4,85160248,88,James Cameron's vault into the big time after scoring with the exploitation actioner The Terminator makes up for lack of surprise with sheer volume of thrills and chills - emphasis is decidedly on the plural aspect of the title.
Aliens,8.4,85160248,88,"The startling thing about ""Aliens"" is how obsessed it is with women as child bearers. It's  the theme that allows the movie to have all the trappings of a typical science fiction/action movie while creating a primal emotive connection for the audience."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,88,"Under the direction of James (''The Terminator'') Cameron, [the special effects team has] put together a flaming, flashing, crashing, crackling blow-'em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,80,"Cameron isn't as concerned with scares or atmosphere, the staples of traditional horror films, as he is with setting up difficult situations for his characters to get out of, leaving audiences deliciously on edge."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,80,"Cruder than the original, Aliens is a distinctly greedy mega-production."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,80,"Toward the end, the film resorts to placing a young girl in jeopardy in a pathetic attempt to pander to who knows what audience. Some people have praised the technical excellence of Aliens. Well, the Eiffel Tower is technically impressive, but I wouldn`t want to watch it fall apart on people for two hours."
The Poseidon Adventure,7.1,84563118,83,"There's ample overacting by the likes of Stella Stevens, Ernest Borgnine, and Shelley Winters, but the movie's one-obstacle-atop-another plot—and active meditation on faith—remain sharp and surprising."
The Poseidon Adventure,7.1,84563118,83,"Once the lady in question is overturned by a freak tidal wave the tone shifts from unintentionally comedic to undeniably exciting as renegade priest Gene Hackman leads a motley band of souls (including Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, and Roddy McDowall) on their upside down quest to escape from a watery grave."
The Poseidon Adventure,7.1,84563118,80,The Poseidon Adventure is a highly imaginative and lustily-produced meller that socks over the dramatic struggle of 10 passengers to save themselves after an ocean liner capsizes when struck by a mammoth tidal wave created by a submarine earthquake.
The Poseidon Adventure,7.1,84563118,75,"The effects here run the gamut from grandiose to goofy, but watch the upside-down ballroom sequence again. It's a set piece of pure destructive bliss, set to a symphony of screaming and breaking glass. Awesome."
The Poseidon Adventure,7.1,84563118,75,"A well thought-out script and fine direction keep a steady amount of tension, which doesn't let up until the survivors are rescued."
The Poseidon Adventure,7.1,84563118,75,A nightmarishly schematic fantasia of guiltless discomfort.
The Poseidon Adventure,7.1,84563118,70,"It's a terrific piece of junk: the top-notch screenwriters (Stirling Silliphant and Wendell Mayes) never let a cliché slip through the net, and Neame's anaemic direction ensures that every absurdity is treated at face value."
The Poseidon Adventure,7.1,84563118,63,"This is a wonderful formula. I love it. The Poseidon Adventure is the kind of movie you know is going to be awful, and yet somehow you gotta see it, right?"
The Poseidon Adventure,7.1,84563118,60,"Though tensions slacken and credibility is strained here, realistic technical effects make the stricken ship and the efforts of its survivors to escape a fairly spellbinding adventure."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,90,"But where most rugged he-man films feature a few action sequences scattered throughout, director Renny Harlin keeps the adventure stuff in this reputed $ 65 million production coming at an astonishing pace."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,80,"All of the performers are upstaged by the film's breathtaking backdrop, and by the fast and furious way Renny Harlin, the director, approaches action sequences."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,80,Action filmmaking at its best; a career high for director Harlin and arguably Stallone as well.
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,80,"Director Harlin's only large mistake is staging the several violent deaths too authentically. They momentarily mar the high-speed implausibility of a movie that, like his Die Hard 2, agreeably combines the edgy and the genial."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,78,It grabs you by the viscera in the opening prologue and for the next two hours rarely lets go.
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,75,Movies like this are machines for involving us and thrilling us. Cliffhanger is a fairly good machine.
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,75,"As directed by Renny Harlin (the director of Die Hard 2), Cliffhanger passes the principal tests of an action movie - it has truly awe-inspiring stunts and special effects and many of its suspense sequences will leave you with your heart in your mouth."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,75,"Cliffhanger offers us breathtaking mountain scenery, some occasionally gripping action sequences, and a lot of gags--mostly unintentional and mostly courtesy of Sylvester Stallone."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,67,"Despite the don't-look-down Olympian settings, Cliffhanger's spirit is brutal and earthbound."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,50,"The dialogue is routine, frequently punctuated by cliches, and the character-building scenes do little more than waste time."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,50,"On the other hand, the brutality and sadism it delivers at every opportunity, which we're supposed to take for granted as part of the ""fun,"" left me feeling that any civilization that can create such an entertainment may not deserve to survive."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,50,"For all its technical sophistication, this movie is as blaring and unambiguous as a picture book for the very young."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,50,"He's slightly more articulate than usual, but the lines still fall from his lips like beaten boxers to the mat. Not that it much matters, given the constant mayhem."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,40,"It's an eroticism of nastiness -- triple-X fare for dirty old men in raincoats. If you resist this sleazy gorefest, you'll be right to feel proud of yourself."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,88,"For its first hour is as exciting an action picture as the Die Hard films. The tension and humor level tail off a bit toward the conclusion, but Steven Seagal and Chicago director Andy Davis clearly declare themselves as top-flight talent."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,75,"The formula is obvious: Die Hard Goes to Sea. I walked into the screening in a cynical frame of mind, but then a funny thing happened. The movie started working for me."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,75,"Under Siege is an immensely slick, if also old-fashioned and formulaic, entertainment. Steven Seagal fans and action buffs should eat up this taut suspenser, which is set entirely on board a battleship."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,70,"In the brutally efficient Under Siege, Seagal, with his soft-spoken nihilist charm, attempts to move beyond limb-snapping exploitation and into epically scaled mainstream thrillers. He succeeds — but only because this sort of slick action bash doesn’t require a star with much personality. At this point, personality might only get in the way."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,67,"Everything about the movie is overscaled, overbrutal, overbroad, full of holes. Yet there's something cheerful and wacky about it; it's a light-hearted blood bath."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,63,"This no-brainer is fine if all you're after a bit of escapism, but don't look for anything deeper than that."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,60,"As wild as the premise is, Under Siege is almost guiltily enjoyable."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,60,"An entertaining splasher film, Under Siege pits Casey Ryback (Seagal) against psycho terrorists Strannix (Tommy Lee Jones) and Krill (Gary Busey). As with most action films, viewers guessing the ending won't disappoint themselves, though the setting is certainly different from the usual urban decay of Seagal dramas. Everything is played out on the Missouri, which is actually the cleverly reconstructed USS Alabama. Would that such cleverness had been applied to the script, which has holes big enough to drive a submarine through."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,60,"Davis handles the pacy action sequences confidently, with dark, claustrophobic interiors enhancing the suspense; so it's all the more disappointing when corny dialogue and barely-sketched characters let things down."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,60,"During its opening scenes, Under Siege threatens to achieve something like Die Hard's blend of wit, ingenuity and action, with Jones and Busey making highly entertaining, creepy-funny villains. Once the stolid Seagal takes over, however, we settle into a predictable high-tech groove of explosions, gunplay and gore."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,50,"Ultimately, Under Siege isn't much because, basically, with Seagal as the star there's no real human center. But Davis, playing to Seagal's strengths, has woven a carefully crafted confection around the star, who has enough moves to hold it all together."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,88,"Harrison Ford - that most decent of decent men - helps to carry the new film on his broad shoulders. With his blunt, Everyman features and sympathetically furrowed brow, he comes off as such a solid, good guy that it's impossible not to care about his upstanding character."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,88,"Apart from the odd titter, this is a sound formula suspense movie with spiffy set piece thrills, directed with assurance by Dead Calm's Philip Noyce and attractively played by the plausibly anxious principals."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,80,"The fierce-looking Sean Bean is outstandingly good as Ryan's main antagonist, and Patrick Bergin brings the right air of calculation to the terrorist mastermind he plays. Several of the film's main sequences, like an encounter between Mr. Bean's Sean Miller and David Threlfall as the police inspector who has been his captor, derive their horror from the looks of pure loathing that these terrorists bestow upon their prey."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,80,"Given the creative recession in the movies, you could do worse than sit through Patriot Games. If this would-be blockbuster slavishly follows summer movie guidelines, it does so well -- or adequately. Neither poisonous nor great, it never loses sight of its mall-movie mandate, to defend American hearth and home against invincible boy-toy bogymen."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,80,"The most interesting aspect of Patriot Games, however, is the casting of Ford as Ryan, given that Alec Baldwin originated the character in the preceding film. In contrast to Baldwin's rather colorless CIA analyst ill-suited for work as an agent, Ford informs his character with believable world-weariness which subsequently transforms into rage at the prospect of harm to his family. In many ways, Ford grounds Patriot Games in a degree of emotion that distinguishes it from most run-of-the-mill action thrillers."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,80,"The high-tech stuff is absorbing. Harrison Ford once again demonstrates what a solid, convincing actor he is, and there's good supporting work from Archer, Thora Birch as the Ryans' precocious daughter, and the irreplaceable James Fox as a British cabinet minister. But at the end, when a character is leaping into a burning speedboat in choppy seas, I wondered if this was exactly what Tom Clancy had in mind."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,75,"For Patriot Games to have been more than a generic international thriller, it would have needed to take us deep inside the clandestine organizations — the IRA and the CIA — on which Clancy is fixated. That doesn’t happen."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,75,"Our favorite parts, though, were the moments of unintentional humor, mostly courtesy of Ms. Archer. Her insufferably goody-goody performance makes you wish Glenn Close would show up brandishing a kitchen knife."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,75,So duff that you wonder why they didn't ask Roger Moore to star.
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,75,"The main problem with Patriot Games, though, is that the inevitable confrontation between Ryan and Miller takes forever to materialize. In the interim, Noyce gets bogged down in the mass of technical detail -- the inside-CIA baseball -- that is such an integral aspect of Clancy's books. On the page, Clancy's research is impressively exhaustive, and if by chance you become bored, you can always skip ahead. But a movie doesn't afford us this luxury. Some of what we're shown about the inner working of the intelligence network is fascinating, but sometimes it can become an irritating distraction. You just want to cut to the chase."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,70,"Tom Clancy was right the first time. Paramount's Patriot Games is an expensive stiff. Mindless, morally repugnant and ineptly directed to boot, it's a shoddy followup to Par's 1990 hit ""The Hunt for Red October."""
Die Hard,8.2,83008852,100,"Not only is it a thrill-a-minute ride, but it has one of the best film villains in recent memory, a hero everyone can relate to, dialogue that crackles with wit, and a lot of very impressive pyrotechnics."
Die Hard,8.2,83008852,100,"Only the hardest of hearts could fail to enjoy the great 80s action classic, rereleased for its 30th anniversary: with uproarious explosions, deafening shootouts and smart-alec tag lines following the bad guys getting shot."
Die Hard,8.2,83008852,100,"A firepowered, blood-drenched action picture that doesn't let up."
Die Hard,8.2,83008852,88,"As high tech, rock hard and souped up as an action film can be."
Die Hard,8.2,83008852,80,"A logistical wonder, a marvel of engineering, and relentlessly, mercilessly thrilling."
Die Hard,8.2,83008852,75,"A triumph of slick direction and lowbrow thrills, marred but not spoiled by a sour aftertaste."
Die Hard,8.2,83008852,75,"On a technical level, there's a lot to be said for Die Hard. It's when we get to some of the unnecessary adornments of the script that the movie shoots itself in the foot."
Days of Thunder,6,82670733,80,"Thunder is exactly what it promises to be: Not Much -- but at dizzying speed, stripped down and free of wind-resistant subtlety. There's a certain integrity to that. A certain deafening integrity."
Days of Thunder,6,82670733,80,"If ""Top Gun"" was a stylish bimbo of a movie, all cleavage, white teeth and aerodynamic flash, then Days of Thunder is its paradoxical twin -- a bimbo with brains."
Days of Thunder,6,82670733,75,And Cruise is so efficiently packaged in this product that he plays the same role as a saint in a Mexican village's holy day procession: It's not what he does that makes him so special; it's the way he manifests everybody's faith in him.
Days of Thunder,6,82670733,75,"Tony Scottmdoes his utmost to pump up the audience's adrenaline at all times, which means that the film's big moments - the races, the crashes, the news that someone needs brain surgery - don't seem that different from the small ones."
Days of Thunder,6,82670733,70,"This expensive genre film about stock car racing has many of the elements that made the same team's Top Gun a blockbuster, but the producers recruited scripter Robert Towne to make more out of the story than junk food."
Days of Thunder,6,82670733,70,"The film, though sleek and easy to sit through, replaces genuine dramatic involvement with a superficial, rock & roll empathy-it's as though we were watching Cruise's character and playing air guitar to his emotions. There are plenty of soulless movies around. What's special about Days of Thunder is that it works overtime trying to convince you it's not one of them."
Days of Thunder,6,82670733,70,Screenwriter Robert Towne has certainly not challenged his gifts -- the script is loaded with stock cars and stock characters -- but he does deliver what's necessary: a workable setup for exciting NASCAR racing footage shot on sixteen Winston Cup tracks from Daytona to Watkins Glen.
Days of Thunder,6,82670733,70,"Days of Thunder delivers only the bare essentials. Boys, the reasoning seems to go, will be lured into the theater by the siren call of gasoline and super-charged engines, while their girl friends will tag along to get a look at Cruise in tight jeans."
Days of Thunder,6,82670733,67,"Every motion, from the clamour of the racetrack to the sparring of teacher and pupil, has been worked out for audience satisfaction and grants none. This is not a real film, it is an automaton, a pod-movie, and, thankfully, proved the death nail for such high-concept filmmaking."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,70,"To the fan of 80s slashers, this return to glorious excess is a beautiful thing."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,67,"So can Freddy beat up Jason, or what? Let's just say that neither one would have stood a chance against Abbott and Costello."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,63,A surprisingly ambitious entry into a genre that felt bankrupt and over more than a decade ago.
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,63,"Succeeds as a guilty pleasure, a monster mash that clobbers the recent lackluster sequels plaguing both legacies. If only that were a higher compliment."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,60,Visually imaginative and energetic.
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,"Considering what the filmmakers had to work with, and the fact that it has all been done before, Freddy Vs. Jason isn't bad. And sometimes not bad is almost good."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,"Attempts none of the witty, provocative visual and metaphysical set pieces from any of the ''Nightmare'' movies. And it offers none of the real fright of the early ''Friday the 13th'' films. In fact, the movie is deeply, proudly unimaginative."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,"The setup is bad even by slasher-film standards: poorly acted, atrociously written and unimaginatively directed. But once Freddy and Jason have at it, the movie takes on a recklessly kinetic energy that finally delivers on its title's promise."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,"Truth be told, the movie isn't among the worst sequels of this summer."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,"The best way to sum up Freddy Vs. Jason is: good concept, mediocre execution."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,"Are these iconic, antihero relics smartly satirized in a post-slasher, or is FVJ just more dated, third-wave trash? Disappointingly, it's the latter."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,"Though a stickler might ask what's at stake in a fight to the death between two guys who are already dead, the hard-core fans aren't likely to be disappointed."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,The basic formula of iconic supernatural beings slaughtering plucky teenagers continues with even more graphic violence.
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,"Tremendous energy, outrageous humor, dazzling technical finesse -- and a numbing amount of violence, brutality, bloodshed and all-out savagery. It is downright depressing to think about all that vigorous cinematic artistry and expertise aimed so low."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,42,"Doesn't have any of the creepy suspense that graced the first ""Friday"" movies, and very little of the Daliesque dream imagery of the early ""Nightmares."" It's just a slam-bang succession of gross-out mutilations, played for giggles."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,40,The sentimental novelty of watching two childhood antiheroes have at it dissipates once you realize the lugubrious lengths to which the screenplay must go in order to make that happen.
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,40,"This long-awaited monster mash should satisfy fans of the ""Friday the 13th/A Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchises."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,38,"Since there can be no suspense, the point is to enjoy the hewing of limbs and the severing of necks, to delight in chopped-off fingers and gouged-out eyes. The title characters are embodiments of utter evil, right?"
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,38,"Too much chatting, not enough chills."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,38,"Despite oblique references to ""Psycho"" and ""Children of the Corn,"" Freddy vs. Jason lacks the knowing wit needed to keep it afloat in an age when even the horror spoofs have been spoofed."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,30,"The Hong Kong vet director, Ronny Yu, did a bang-up job in 1998 with ""Bride of Chucky,"" but he can't do much for this one except keep it moving, light it scarily, and pump that plasma."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,30,"This dumb, only intermittently (though sometimes even intentionally) funny sequel presumes that since almost everything else from the 1980's has come back, why not the cynosures of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Friday the 13th"" movies?"
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,30,"The first ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" was wickedly surreal, but the wacky dream sequences were offset by the sitcomlike, almost satirical flatness of ordinary suburban life; that was the really scary part. Freddy Vs. Jason is innocent of such nuances."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,30,"A kind of cinematic analogue of the Iran-Iraq war: It's overlong, it's hard to tell which one's the bad guy, and it's filled with lots of senseless carnage on both sides."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,30,"Aside from a promising scene involving a cornfield rave and the pyrotechnic potential for grain alcohol, it drags along, taking a small eternity to set up a final showdown that plays more like a bloody pro-wrestling event than the stuff of nightmares."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,25,"Connoisseurs of giant, gnarled chunks of charred flesh, rejoice! There's plenty of it -- or stuff resembling it -- in the slasher-fest convergence of two killer franchises."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,20,Formulaic hodge-podge that trades on a certain demographic's affection for the bogeymen of their formative years.
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,20,"About as threadbare as a favorite childhood plushy. What's more, trying to keep the story line of strained meta-sequel Freddy Vs. Jason straight requires too much of a cogitative investment."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,20,"Witless, excessive and ultimately boring gore-a-thon."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,90,"To appreciate the movie, you have to be okay with vampire violence. I don't mean subtle little nips at the neck and, ooooh, it's directed by Werner Herzog."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,88,"You can sense the difference between a movie that's a technical exercise (""Resident Evil"") and one steamed in the dread cauldrons of the filmmaker's imagination."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,80,"Like the original, Blade II has superior production values and visual and special effects. Snipes and Kristofferson build on the resonance of their original portrayals."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,80,Ghastly yet wonderful at the same time.
Blade II,6.7,82348319,78,Invades theatres with its fangs bared for action. It's bloody hell and we love every minute.
Blade II,6.7,82348319,75,"It's all speed, movement and blood -- lots and lots of blood."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,70,"The drawing card for Blade II is --  the promise of a blood-soaked action/horror thrill ride, and Snipes and Del Toro get the down-and-dirty job done with style."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,70,"Just be advised guys, Blade II is as estrogen-free as movies get, so you might want to leave your date behind for this one, or she's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,70,"Everything ""Blade"" should have been but wasn't: stylish, fast-paced, and comfortable with its own ridiculousness."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,70,"Because of the movie's wonderful shamelessness, its mordantly funny chills and fights are huge turn-ons.  A B picture in love with the zest of its comic-book origins, it embodies that medium's pulse-pounding spiritedness and silliness."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,67,"Del Toro lays on the operatic head-trip gore, but his heavy-handed embrace of the ''Blade'' mythology allows Wesley Snipes to give more of a performance than he did in the first film."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,63,"Though superior to the original Blade, the superiority is mostly in the myriad ways the ""suck-head"" enemies can be blown up, melted and dismembered."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,63,"The film stays true to its unpretentious origins -- it's like a comic book come to life, with an undeniable visual flair, a lot of kinetic action sequences, minimal character development, and a plot that could charitably be called ""uneven""."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,63,"What makes Blade 2 marginally better than ""Blade,"" especially if you thought the first was a hollow spectacle? It has a plot."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,60,May be too grisly to extend its appeal beyond its fan base.
Blade II,6.7,82348319,50,"Snipes gives a looser, cooler performance this time around, though emotionally, it's closer to dead than undead. Blade II is for the horror faithful only; others will be grasping their crucifixes."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,50,Much sillier - and the movie's nearly two-hour running time seems to last nearly as long as a vampire's afterlife.
Blade II,6.7,82348319,50,Suffers from way too many fight scenes that last way too long and look way too computer-generated.
Blade II,6.7,82348319,50,Even Del Toro can't raise the conceptually dead.
Blade II,6.7,82348319,42,This vampire story is as soulless as they get.
Blade II,6.7,82348319,40,"The sequences are handsomely designed, but frankly, you might as well be watching someone play a video game."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,38,"It was possible to hope that Blade II would turn out to be good. Well, forget it."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,38,"Against the rest of his dramatically flimsy crew, Snipes' sunglasses-at-midnight strut conveys an almost lifelike sheen. Almost. He's more alive than the movie, which is dead on arrival."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,38,Appallingly violent.
Blade II,6.7,82348319,30,Duller than first version.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,75,"The movie suffers from being the same shape as so many modern blockbusters, and the plot in the second half of the film is basically another riff on the “reach the glowing doodad on a roof to prevent the end of the world” structure. But the focus on the Turtles and the film’s overall amiable sense of goofball humor carries the day."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,67,"Fortunately, Green’s sequel doesn’t have much interest in frustrations; this is a movie about unbridled joy, about transposing a cartoon veneer over a bleak human world."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,63,"""Out of the Shadows” isn’t going to win any awards, good or bad. Neither an embarrassment nor a triumph, it is nevertheless an improvement over the last film."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,63,"This sequel is a good improvement over the 2014 adventure that rebooted the franchise. The effects are better, the pacing is tighter and the overall impact is much more entertaining."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,60,"Does its best to include as much fan fodder as it does kiddie fare with the distinct personalities of the four Turtles — ""Mikey,"" ""Leo,"" ""Raph"" and ""Donnie"" — faithful enough to previous incarnations that both should be happier with the sequel over its predecessor."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,58,"So while Out of the Shadows may not be any smarter than the first installment (or really all that smart at all), it’s certainly a lot more fun."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,58,"While it’s not necessarily a good thing to aim this kind of weaponized marketing at kids, it’s also silly and colorful enough to nearly work as a live-action cartoon. It might rot brains, but perhaps not while regarding them with utter contempt."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,50,"Its openly mercenary ethos initially scan as a bracing lack of pretense in a market crammed to the gills with insidious faux-sentimentality, but its overstuffed relentlessness proves almost equally tedious."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,50,"They’re back for an entertaining enough 3-D sequel to their 2014 franchise revival, and so is the rest of the cast that includes foxy Megan Fox and her ability to wear a naughty schoolgirl outfit."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,50,"This is a production from producer Michael Bay, master of the cinema of CG run amok. And all we helpless mortals can do is cower and duck as those 3D fists fly."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,50,"This unambitious Michael Bay-produced version doesn’t seem interested in cleverness, cravenly settling for the usual generic CGI shtick."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,50,It’s surprisingly enjoyable even if you aren’t already in the bag for the turtles.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,50,"Packed with better action sequences and a smidgeon more emotional resonance, this sequel may be more engaging than its predecessor, but the franchise remains a rather clattering and crude affair."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,50,"The film fares best when it slows down a bit and allows the Turtles' personalities, which are quite engaging, to shine through via their amusing comic banter."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,42,"Out of the Shadows stumbles from one set piece to the next, rarely offering viewers much reason to care in between, and its halfhearted attempts at moving toward the “dark and gritty” end of the comic-book spectrum never land."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,42,"Out of the Shadows’ barrels forward like such a rampaging beast that it decimates everything – plot, character, emotion, basic visual lucidity – in its wake."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,40,"No groundbreaking cinemagic there, but Out of the Shadows’ oddball moments keep things weirdly surreal throughout."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,40,"This movie is, it happens, easier to sit through than the 2014 film. The 3-D action, overseen by the director Dave Green, is not wholly incoherent. The production values (showcasing new mutants and many gear-heavy extra-dimensional machines undreamed of in any actual engineering philosophy) are ultrashiny. And there are even a couple of amusing, albeit unmemorable, sight gags and one-liners."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,40,"True, Out of the Shadows is an improvement over the last Ninja Turtles movie, but only in the way that a mild cold is an improvement over the flu. It’s not good, but at least it’s not so terrible that it makes you want to lie in bed for a few days."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,40,"Considerably better than its predecessor, the central four may give it their all but the people behind this franchise sadly don’t seem all that interested in their crime-fighting, pizza-eating heroes."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,38,"Ultimately, any sass, sentiment and personality are obliterated in the noisy chaos of the climax, which is a grayish brown blur of flying spaceship parts, whirling turtle shells and shouts of ""the beacon!"" It's more cacophonous than cinematic, and loses the quirky charm of the cartoon in the avalanche of computer-generated violence."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,38,"It’s still just a patience-testing bauble for anybody over the age of 12. The Turtles, in this latest incarnation, were and remain shiny but stupid entertainment for kids."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,33,"To his credit, Green makes great use of wide-angle photography so the action feels comprehensible, with surprisingly long shots and effective editing. It’s just a shame the director’s talents are wasted on this brand-stamped mess."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,30,"Visual spectacle still takes precedence over coherent plotting, and the human characters retain all the gravitas of generic placeholders who accidentally made it into the shooting script."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,25,"Cowabunga, the vigilante demi-gods on a half shell are back, and more inane and irritating than ever. Their antics make the 112 minutes it takes to watch this frenetic followup to 2014's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles a torturous mindfuck for any sentient being over the age of  infancy."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,25,"This is the kind of movie that leaves you with the impression that more thought was put into catchphrases and fan service than into a compelling plot, thoughtful characterizations or imaginative action choreography."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,25,"A subpar 3D action comedy featuring four giant motion-capture animated turtles and a raft of human costars, including the dreamy-eyed Fox, wide-shouldered Perry, a remarkably slender Will Arnett, and Laura Linney, who looks tired and uncomfortable throughout the proceedings."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,25,"There are isolated moments of humor, and even charm. The visual effects are at times outstanding. But these positives are overwhelmed by the uninspired whole."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,20,"Forget cowabunga, this is cowadunga. Still, the Oscar for Most Shamefully Contrived Scene goes to the scriptwriters for managing to get franchise eye-candy Megan Fox into a sexy schoolgirl outfit, which, any shorter, would land the film with an R rating."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6,82051601,20,"It’s soon clear that OOTS follows the model of Bay’s Transformers sequels. Longer, louder and boasting even more hardware, it does everything to generate the illusion of bleeding-edge bang-per-buck, while cribbing shamelessly from 1991’s Secret of the Ooze."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,75,"Katniss and Tris might still be queen bees of the genre, but Thomas (Dylan O’Brien) and his fellow Gladers find a satisfying, teen-friendly way to combine rebellion, politics, science and a lot of jogging for a broad audience."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,75,"Actually an entertaining action-adventure that not only stands on its own, but surpasses the more limited rewards offered by ""The Maze Runner."""
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,70,Ball and his cast overcome clichés with gusto.
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,60,"The Scorch Trials isn’t a particularly good movie, but it’s just fast and nutty enough to keep you entertained."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,60,Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials does pretty well. It finishes respectably on a scale between “Hunger Games: Catching Fire” (fizzle) and “The Empire Strikes Back” (aces!).
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,60,"The production design and effects for this apocalyptic terrain are way above par for this sort of thing, and evidence of a much higher budget than Ball had first time around."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,60,"Scorch Trials ambitiously opens up its world with mixed results: gripping action, so-so script."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,60,"While it’s a woefully incomplete middle chapter, at least it’s never boring."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,58,"It comes across as unintentionally comic, because Scorch Trials is basically ""Fleeing In Terror: The Movie."" After more than two straight hours of running and screaming, screaming and running, no wonder Thomas is tired. Even marathoners gotta rest sometime."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,The visuals of a blasted city are impressive but hardly reason to spend $10 to sit in a theater seat and watch a bunch of underdeveloped characters get chased by zombies for an inordinate amount of time.
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"On a thematic level, it remains wholly reprehensible and a fraudulent piece of entertainment. But at least it rips off some better films (Mad Max, Day of the Dead, The Matrix) with a good deal of energy."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"The movie may feel tonally consistent with the first, but it’s also overlong and thoroughly routine."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"There’s lots of eye candy, and the pace is fast, but somehow the movie falls short. You’re forgiven if you get the idea that “Scorch Trials” suffers from “middle movie” fatigue."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"In Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials, selfish oldsters scheme to rob young people of their vital essence, sacrificing them in the process. It’s basically “Social Security: The Movie.”"
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,It’s not a bad movie. It’s like several pretty good ones.
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"Though Ball's workmanlike handling of the second in the trilogy, ""The Scorch Trials,"" proves mainly that he can keep a franchise from running completely off the rails when the tracks have been laid perilously near a swamp of ""dys-lit"" cliches."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"Left without a gimmick, The Scorch Trials wanders between YA cliches — there’s a Resistance, but it’s unclear what they’re resisting — and zombie movie tropes, with the obligatory a zombie bit our friend scene."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"Starts at a sprint and hurtles at us for a good long, stretch, before it stops to catch its breath."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"With more action and less mystery, a returning director and main cast and a handful of sketchy new characters, The Scorch Trials makes for an efficient yet uninspiring sequel."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"The Scorch Trials offers virtually no character development and only hints of plot advancement, mostly just functioning to move a group of obliquely motivated characters from one place to another without giving much clue where the whole thing is headed."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,42,"Director Wes Ball’s adaptation of the second book in author James Dashner’s popular series is the exact opposite of its predecessor, presenting a sprawling adventure that, when not liberally cribbing from more illustrious sci-fi forefathers, spends plentiful time fleshing out the dull details of its oppressed-youth scenario."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,40,"The Scorch Trials adds nothing new to the unkillable dystopian genre, but it’s at least less ponderous than its predecessor. The many chases and ludicrous narrow escapes offer respectable doses of adrenaline."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,40,"Director Wes Ball's film is a mad dash from one place to the next, with little time in between for rest, recuperation or plot development."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,40,"The second installment, which reveals some of the reasons behind their imprisonment, lacks a similar sense of originality and urgency, undercut by overly familiar characterizations and dilatory pacing."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,38,"Larger than its predecessor, last year’s “The Maze Runner,” in every way: in its cast, scope, set pieces and (unfortunately) length. But “more” also means more convoluted."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,38,"Every set piece brings to mind an Epcot Center attraction built from borrowed parts, geared toward reinforcing the young audience's belief that adults just don't understand them."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,30,"The trouble comes when somebody opens their mouth and you’re reminded this is supremely silly stuff, and overall a much lesser version of teens versus the titans of post-apocalypse industry – a copy of a copy of a copy."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,20,"This film is making a wheezing, spluttering sound: the sound of a profitable YA franchise running out of steam."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,20,"One of the most tedious apocalypses to come down the chute in recent years, this series gets lamer, and lazier, with each entry. The only ‘Trial’ offered by this film is the ordeal of watching it."
Payback,7.1,81526121,100,"Payback has a completely different spirit from ""L.A. Confidential'' -- more wild, more silly -- but it has the same attention to the fine points of plot and character."
Payback,7.1,81526121,78,"Helgeland's film positively seethes with bad vibrations; it's kicky, nasty urban sangfroid with pointy little teeth and a serious case of the angries, an existential hand grenade disguised as a heist film."
Payback,7.1,81526121,75,"While there's quite a bit more graphic bloodshed and brutality here than in any of the late screen icon's vehicles, Payback is a worthy '90s successor to his kind of movie."
Payback,7.1,81526121,75,"There is much cleverness and ingenuity in Payback, but Mel Gibson is the key. The movie wouldn't work with an actor who was heavy on his feet, or was too sincere about the material."
Payback,7.1,81526121,70,"Helgeland makes a solid debut as director here, finding a new angle through which to view the Parker character, and doing so without exhausting the possibilities."
Payback,7.1,81526121,70,"Rips out at least one dimension to reduce everything to archetypal good guys and bad guys, or bad guy and worse guys."
Payback,7.1,81526121,67,"Payback is a thriller so mean and degraded it carries a low-down, vicious charge. Sadism is its only real subject, and its only real life as well."
Payback,7.1,81526121,63,Helgeland strips the material back to its pulp origins and overlays it with a patina of glib motifs familiar to devotees of Hollywoods 1970s renaissance.
Payback,7.1,81526121,60,"That script  co-written by Terry Hayes and director Brian Helgeland  is almost too noir for its own good at times, but Gibson somehow manages to pull its implausibility off."
Payback,7.1,81526121,60,"The only moments of conviction come from an Asian-American dominatrix called Pearl (Lucy Liu), who brings far more glee to the task of beating people up than the picture's star or director. If the audience could have half as much fun as Pearl is having, Payback would be a kick."
Payback,7.1,81526121,50,"In the last third, Payback turns into a joke."
Payback,7.1,81526121,50,Payback is a brutally entertaining crime drama that should have been a little more brutal and a little less entertaining.
Payback,7.1,81526121,50,"Not an embarrassment, but it's not distinguished, either."
Payback,7.1,81526121,50,"Payback may not always be P.C., but it's not interested in making friends, anyway. Just killing enemies."
Payback,7.1,81526121,50,"Has the makings of that rarest of ventures, an adaptation that is true to the spirit of the original as well as its own time and place. But as Payback wends its way toward its conclusion, its promise dissipates and its pleasures wane."
Payback,7.1,81526121,40,"The comic timing and Gibson's mugging are skillful, but the movie fulfills expectations of plot twists and ironic atmosphere only after having made clear that it won't be offering much else."
Payback,7.1,81526121,40,It careens from coarse comedy to smart-ass stylization to vicious violence without ever becoming convincing on any level.
Payback,7.1,81526121,40,"Consider that in Point Blank, Lee Marvin walks through the film with the look of a man who's lost his soul.  You can see it in his eyes. Look in Gibson's eyes in this one and you'll see soullessness, but it doesn't seem to come from anywhere within his character."
Payback,7.1,81526121,40,An interesting cast is wasted in this misanthropic thriller.
Payback,7.1,81526121,38,So it's hard to know who gets the blame for Payback. I say we cut Mel some slack and put the hex on Helgeland.
Payback,7.1,81526121,25,"We're supposed to adore Gibson's sang-froid and his toughness, but everything, a few good lines aside, is so witless and monotonous it becomes numbing."
Payback,7.1,81526121,25,"What one word might best describe Payback? How about ""loathsome""?"
Congo,5.1,81022101,75,"The result is not a movie that is very good, exactly, but it's entertaining and funny."
Congo,5.1,81022101,50,This is easily the worst filmed version of anything penned by the prolific author.
Congo,5.1,81022101,50,"Congo is basically the old African ooga-mooga movie brought into the P.C., high-tech age."
Congo,5.1,81022101,50,"Congo, adapted by John Patrick Shanley and directed by Stephen Spielberg protege Frank Marshall, is not one of the better silly action pictures set in gratuitously fake jungles and featuring nefarious foreigners, threatening natives, and talking gorillas."
Congo,5.1,81022101,50,"This glib, overheated film about vicious primates delivers little suspense, nor are there signs of the 65 cited volumes and articles that turned Mr. Crichton's book into such a learning experience."
Congo,5.1,81022101,40,"Even with these high-end artists on the team, though, the movie seems thin."
Congo,5.1,81022101,40,"What begins as mildly intriguing stuff with some genuinely unsettling moments, quickly melts into a plot so confusing that it almost begins to look as though the editor was taking some mind-altering substance."
Congo,5.1,81022101,40,"Whatever John Patrick Shanley's script may have tried to do in adapting Crichton's book, it clearly feels as if the picture were edited to leave the action sequences in while removing any connecting material that might have helped them make sense."
Congo,5.1,81022101,40,"As if aware that Congo is the least interesting adventure ever filmed, screenwriter John Patrick Shanley (who once wrote a funny movie called ""Moonstruck"") tries to inoculate the activities with humor."
Congo,5.1,81022101,30,"But Congo leads to nothing but a fierce battle with the gray gorillas, a kind of guns vs. fangs scene; and a convenient and incongruous volcano eruption that looks as artificial as a video game."
Congo,5.1,81022101,25,"In stupidity, this movie ranks up there among the greats."
Congo,5.1,81022101,25,"One thing is certain: It's a bomb trying to be a hit, and at that it'll never succeed."
Congo,5.1,81022101,25,"Without Spielberg's technical pizazz, and with a gummy mixture of homage and spoof, Congo chokes on its own tongue in cheek."
Congo,5.1,81022101,25,"I don't know the novel, but judging from the script by Crichton and John Patrick Shanley, this must be scraping the bottom of the Crichton barrel."
Congo,5.1,81022101,20,"All I know is that something has gone terribly, drum-beatingly wrong in Congo (Paramount, PG-13), and you can sense Jungle Trouble brewing from the git-go."
Congo,5.1,81022101,16,"Not only have bothersome plot changes been made, but the entire tone of the book has been transformed from tension to tongue-in-cheek with dismal results."
Congo,5.1,81022101,10,"The director, Frank Marshall, who has produced films for Steven Spielberg, gets his own Michael Crichton book to play with—and the results are disastrous."
Congo,5.1,81022101,10,"Jawdroppingly bad, this adaptation of Michael Crichton's 1980 novel about a talking ape named Amy and a fabled lost city deep in the jungles of central Africa is as sophisticated in execution as a Jungle Jim movie."
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,91,"There's a real gee-whiz kick to the fantasy of being the brainiest kid on the planet, and a down-to-earth quality to Jimmy and his not-so-bright, but ever-so-stalwart best buddies."
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,83,"A lickety-split, madly packed, roller-coaster entertainment that might almost have been designed to make you scared of how much smarter your kids are than you."
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,80,"A witty, well-crafted comedy that combines primal slapstick with sharp satiric banter to keep children and parents laughing together."
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,80,"The movie's essentially a series of high-speed, dizzying rocket chases that should keep the young'uns perfectly quiet."
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,75,"It doesn't have the little in-jokes that make ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" fun for grown-ups. But adults who appreciate the art of animation may enjoy the look of the picture."
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,75,"A thoroughly entertaining animated comedy that's sweet enough for the youngest moviegoers, and smart enough for the most cynical chaperone."
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,75,"Clever and funny, with a dense surface of ideas and moods."
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,75,This little charmer both celebrates and kids the corny conventions of family sitcoms.
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,75,"After Jimmy Neutron was over, I felt glassy-eyed and a little headachy. But the boy genius who accompanied me to the screening could not take his eyes off the screen. I think he's in his room right now, building a shrink ray to try out on his dad."
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,70,For the sake of more irony--the movie is lousy with it--the precocious characters have an infantile response to the discovery that their parents are missing: all want their mommies after a night of junk-food excess.
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,70,"Moppet appeal of the present feature rests in three can't-miss concepts -- cool gadgets, the desire to see grownups disappear and space travel. Pic delivers on all three points and doesn't have to do a whole lot more."
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,70,"The film is short on plot, and any form of character development, but I am sure the target audience of children will find plenty to enjoy even though most adults may find it a bit boring. All in all, Jimmy Neutron is a nice holiday diversion for the family."
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,70,The movie's clatter and whiz-bang suggests more humor than there actually is.
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,60,"Grownups who grew up on The Jetsons and children who, like the movie's heroes, aren't yet nine years old, should enjoy this film."
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,60,"Aimed squarely at the under-6 crowd, is basically the pilot for a Nickelodeon series with an already heavily merchandised character."
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,50,"After ""Monsters, Inc.,""  this movie may be a bit of a letdown, but there are some scenes that will delight elementary-school-age children and older preschoolers -- notably the gross-out moments."
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,50,Inventive and intermittently amusing.
Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,6,80936232,50,Frenetic and uninvolving.
Another 48 Hrs.,5.8,80818974,60,"The movie isn't a disaster, and if you responded to the first one, its memory may carry you over the roughness, the excessive, ugly violence and lack of conviction here. Hill and his stars are merely going through the motions, but the motions are immensely familiar. If you've been there before, then you've been there."
Another 48 Hrs.,5.8,80818974,50,"If it does nothing else, Another 48 HRS reminds us that Murphy is a big, genuine talent. Now it's time for him to make a good movie."
Another 48 Hrs.,5.8,80818974,50,"It's only too bad nobody lectured the producers about creative cowardice. If someone had, Another 48 Hrs. might have been another good movie instead of just another damned sequel."
Another 48 Hrs.,5.8,80818974,50,Purposeless waste of director Walter Hill's energies.
Another 48 Hrs.,5.8,80818974,40,"Though the body count is high, all of the people killed are faceless or only minor characters, until the end. It's as if the movie were saying that lethal violence is acceptable (and fun) as long as the victims - like the victims of guided missiles and high-altitude bombing - remain anonymous. Any comedy that allows the mind to ponder high-altitude bombing is in deep trouble."
Another 48 Hrs.,5.8,80818974,38,"What seems more problematic is the virtual exaltation of Dirty Harry vigilantism, the storm trooper mentality and behavior on Nolte's part that the film breezily takes for granted; if there's any irony about it, it's carefully designed to wash over the storm trooper types in the audience and not give offense to them--only to the rest of us."
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,50,"Between the Predators' dripping their glow-in-the-dark green blood and the Aliens' getting their rubber cement mucous all over everything, this is certainly a very sticky movie, though not, ultimately, a very frightening or commanding one."
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,50,"Surprisingly free of gore, unlike its predecessors."
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,50,"This is one schlockfest that may be enjoyed more by casual viewers than by hard-core fans, since writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson breaks with the established mythology of both properties whenever he feels like it. Like it matters."
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,40,A reductive spook show in which a bunch of puny humans get chased around by scary monsters.
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,40,"The thing-a-ma-jigs have it out with the whatch-a-ma-call-its -- as several humans scurry and scream between -- in Alien Vs. Predator, the kind of two-for-one dogfight (last repped by ""Freddy Vs. Jason"") that usually does more to bury a franchise than revive it."
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,40,"The fifth outing for the slime-dripping, shape-changing creatures, the Aliens are looking a little dogged, perhaps ready for the Alien Retirement Home. Meanwhile, the Predator warriors, who never achieved the artistic heights of their counterpart, look better invisible. When visible, they resemble robotic can openers gone berserk."
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,40,"With perfunctory battle sequences, cardboard characters, and uncreative scare 'ems, Paul W.S. Anderson's monster mashup isn't quite terrible enough to be so-bad-it's-awesome, but his swift (if forced) plotting and amusingly shoddy costumes mean that there could be worse ways to enjoy air-conditioning."
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,40,"It would take a true visionary not to borrow from Alien Vs. Predator's predecessors, but Anderson lifts more than most will consider polite, borrowing to the point where some viewers may wonder whether he simply edited in footage from the old movies (or even, at one point, ""Jurassic Park"")."
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,40,"Make sense? No, it doesn't. But if you manage to endure the exposition, you'll get what you paid for: popping chests. Invisible stalkers. Nicely paced chases through corridors that constantly reconfigure in interlocking stone puzzles."
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,40,Fans beware - your fave two sci-fi franchises have been stripped of all their guile and maturity.
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,38,"It's a murky, empty-headed dive into the depths of the Antarctic and the heart of monster movie cliches that leaves you praying for most of the cast to get killed off fast, to put them (and us) out of our misery."
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,38,"The film is critic-proof and it will find an audience, but it's hard to imagine even the film's target demographic (teenage boys) being overly enthusiastic about the product. It's disposable entertainment of the worst kind."
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,38,"Anderson gets style points for the pyramid, though. The building - a combination of Aztec, Egyptian and Cambodian elements loaded with sophisticated gadgetry - totally rocks."
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,30,It will end up frustrating fans of both movie franchises enough to make them wish someone more competent was in charge.
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,30,"The first 45 minutes or so is stupefying--flat, disjointed, missing all human connective tissue."
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,30,"Well, Sanaa Lathan's in there somewhere as the smart and sexy ass-kickin' chick, but it's really all about the monster disembowelments, which happen often."
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,30,Dumb.
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,25,"Its often hard to figure out whos winning, much less care about it. One thing is certain: Nobody is going to be demanding a rematch."
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,25,"The actual fights between the predators and the serpents are too silly to contemplate. Both shiny and metallic, they look like kitchen appliances fighting it out.  That's when you can see them. Writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson (""Resident Evil"") has created the darkest, if not worst, sci-fi movie since ""Battlefield Earth."""
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,20,"This space invaders stuff is, like, so 1981."
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,5.6,80282231,0,Take a wretched premise. Imagine the worst picture that could be made from it. Then imagine something even worse. That's Alien vs. Predator.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,67,"It may be mindless and sexless and humorless, but Jumper jumps."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,63,"Liman applies the same frenetic approach to action scenes that made ""The Bourne Identity"" such an engaging and exciting affair."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,60,"It’s Liman’s least charismatic action movie and the least developed, but it still packs some cracking action into its brief running time and lays foundations on which a great franchise could be built."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,58,I'll say this much for Jumper – it's got a great premise. Or at least the beginnings of a premise.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,It's a feature-length teaser for a never-to-be sci-fi franchise.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,The major weakness in Jumper is the piling on of action and narrative in the last ten to twelve minutes. It's as though the editor was rushing to meet a deadline and did the best he could with too much footage.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,Jumper proves disappointingly inert. All the state-of-the-art visual effects in the world can't compensate for spotty plotting and bland characters that prevent an intriguing premise from going the distance.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"Director Doug Liman churns out a serviceable sci-fi thriller/videogame template that plays like ""The Matrix Lite"" and, finally, isn't nearly as cool as its trailer."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"Liman, for all his craft, doesn't have enough FUN with the premise."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,Goes south as a sci-fi film.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"The whole production does reek a bit of origin story filminess, but even so, it's light sabers beyond Christensen's sad, revengeful fate in ""Episode III"" and does offer a nice view of the top of the Sphinx's head no less than three times."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"The best thing -- maybe the only good thing -- about the expensive sci-fi movie, Jumper, is its high-concept premise, which gives its hero the power of teleporting himself anywhere on the globe in the blink of an eye: from the Coliseum of Rome to the North Pole."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"The film LOOKS great, but at a brisk 88 minutes, there's no time to fill in back story, from the epic history of paladin persecution to the deeply personal mystery of David's mother, and the cliffhanger ending is so abrupt that the movie seems bizarrely truncated."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"Woefully short on script, the picture ends up disappearing down the wormhole of its own premise."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"It doesn't help that the performances are bland (particularly those of Christensen and Bilson) and that what comes out of their mouths is uninspired. Short on imagination and anchored by a wan hero, Jumper is a flight of fancy that never fully takes off."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"Though dazzled by its ultra-modern wizardry and the high gloss of its production values, one can also feel the globalist double standard roiling underneath the adolescent-kid fantasy plot. Jumper tells us that Americans fantasize about getting rich by stealing and going everywhere they want without restrictions; that they are materialistic, disrespect foreign antiquities, and remain blind to their own and to world history."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,Jumper is all high concept with little invested in characters or story.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"There's enough kinetic energy in Jumper to light a thousand houses. Unfortunately, there's no one home in any of them."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"But what can you do with Hayden Christensen? He's as close as we have to an android actor. It's all a chore for him. He never looks sufficiently scared, impressed, or surprised by any of this."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"Fast is a good quality in an action/adventure. But there is lightning-paced and then there is warp speed. Doug Liman's Jumper is the latter, a not-so-good quality in an action/adventure for the simple reason that the audience can't figure out what's going on."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,It's difficult to know whom to root for.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,42,No exciting action can cover the film's profound shallowness and repulsive attitude toward everyone but Christensen.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,38,"Jumper, the film, goes everywhere and nowhere."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,38,Director Doug Liman and a trio of writers eventually forget the rules they set up and hurl combatants to places they could never have seen or even known about: Who'd willingly project himself into the middle of a Chechnyan war zone?
Jumper,6.1,80172128,38,Deep into Hollywood's Dumb Season comes one of its dumbest offerings.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,38,These site-shifting extravaganzas sometimes reach an exhilarating level of near-abstraction. So it's too bad that just about everything surrounding the action scenes of the picture is such unmitigated cr--.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,30,"The result is more or less a remake of the great scene in “Sherlock Jr.,” where a dozing Buster Keaton dreams himself through a shuffled sequence of backgrounds. Jumper is ten times as brutal, maybe a thousand times more costly, and eighty-four years late, but it’s a start."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,30,"Jumper is so lame -- undernourished in its characterizations, stillborn in its action scenes -- that it inevitably leads the idled mind to wondering how this movie got past the pitch stage."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,30,Jumper is so in sync with the language of modern action movies that it’s possible to look past its soullessness and go with the quantum flow.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,30,A barely coherent genre mishmash.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,30,"Jumper not only makes the rules up as it goes along; it neglects to tell us what those rules are, which is both unfair and unfun."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,30,"Like so many other CGI behemoths, this dull action fantasy ultimately squashes rather than inspires one's sense of wonder."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,25,"The best stuff in Jumper comes early, while the movie is still busy explaining its scenario. It's only when all the pieces are in place and the story actually kicks in that things start to fall apart, and quickly."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,25,A totally ridiculous and incoherent sci-fi adventure.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,25,"Talk about disappointing. Director Doug Liman exuded style and cool in ""Swingers,"" ""Go"" and ""The Bourne Identity."" He lost his way in the star bloat of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" and now his mojo is buried in this amped-up sci-fi chase flick."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,0,"Jumper, based on the novel by Steven Gould, re-defines -- downward -- the notion of dreadful. It does so by dispensing with everything a movie needs for a shot at being merely awful. Dramatic development? None. Entertaining dialogue? Ditto. Internal logic? Puhleez. Intriguing characters? No characters, thus no intrigue. Interesting performances? Essentially none, though with an asterisk."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,75,"While it does take on the franchise burden in hefty doses, the film remains a fun, and funny, B-movie throughout."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,75,"While The Mummy isn't the big bang preferred to start the Dark Universe of classic monsters, it's a serviceable popcorn flick dangling hints of promising things to come."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,75,"The Mummy is a tomb full of action-packed guilty pleasure that owns its horror, humor and rampant silliness equally."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,67,"I’m not sure that this aimless, lukewarm take on The Mummy is how the studio dreamed that its Dark Universe would begin. But it’s just good enough to keep you curious about what comes next."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,63,"Action-packed and patently ridiculous, it’s all in good fun."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,60,It’s all patently ridiculous - and surprisingly watchable.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,60,"While there’s little here to jangle the nerves, The Mummy does wrap up enough adventure, action and quips to make it, if not a scream, a worthwhile Friday night out."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,60,"An odd but frothily entertaining genre cocktail, which coasts on the charisma of its two biggest names and keeps things just fun enough to forgive its considerable lapses in narrative."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,57,"Given that The Mummy only barely works as a movie on its own account, the question becomes whether it works as a franchise-starter. And the answer is that while its franchise elements are foregrounded, they still aren’t terribly compelling."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,55,"There are moments where it reaches out for horror and produces something interesting and distinct from Hollywood’s other blockbusters, but those moments are buried beneath unremarkable and, by the end, tedious action sequences."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,52,"As a commentary on the modern blockbuster, the movie’s fascinating. But as an actual movie, it’s fairly disheartening."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,50,"The Mummy does have elements that are effective, especially Sofia Boutella in the title role, but with all the hurly-burly on screen the virtues get lost in the shuffle."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,50,"The Mummy starts off light and very quickly goes dark — fading rapidly, along with our hopes that this latest monster mash might possibly be any good."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,50,"Because the movie’s carrying a heavy load of corporate expectations, it gets pulled in different directions by competing agendas before eventually collapsing into incoherence."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,50,The Mummy is crippled by a failure of imagination.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,50,The Mummy is the rare Cruise film that doesn’t quite give audiences their money’s worth.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,50,"Too much is at stake throughout, leading to formulaic plot filler and exposition that snuff out the spark of the early scenes."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,50,"The Mummy is a literal-minded, bumptious monster mash of a movie. It keeps throwing things at you, and the more you learn about the ersatz intricacy of its “universe,” the less compelling it becomes."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,42,"Unfortunately, The Mummy’s true curse is that it’s doomed to sacrifice its moments of fun, breezy spectacle for overwrought world-building."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,40,"Ultimately, and perhaps most disappointingly, The Mummy winds up being not so much its own movie as what, by the end, feels like the first episode of a show that's already been renewed for several seasons. Because, in some respects, that's what it is."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,40,"The nonsensical story would matter less if The Mummy would get out of Cruise’s way and let him do what he does best. Instead, it buries him beneath punishing dialogue scenes and surrounds him with unconvincing and unoriginal special effects."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,40,Everything about The Mummy strains solely towards setting up a franchise in a world which only makes sense to its writers.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,40,"Weirdly out of place here, Cruise brings little daring and less charm to the film, though to be fair to the actor, his character's a stiff."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,40,"The core of The Mummy is built around a mostly fun, fast-moving vibe, while its malformed midsection seeks to undermine anything good it has accomplished."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,40,It’s a ragbag of action scenes which needed to be bandaged more tightly.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,40,"Sure it’s got big, blurry action scenes, a plane crash, and an army of dusty, mindless zombies. But I think some of them may have been the screenwriters, because the movie’s practically lifeless."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,38,You only have to watch the trailer to know that Producer-Director Alex Kurtzman’s reboot of Brendan Fraser’s once-charming mummy movies is full of embalming fluid.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,38,"And the living are pretty lifeless themselves. As led by the often wooden Tom Cruise playing the U.S. soldier who inadvertently wakes the dead, and directed by an indecisive Alex Kurtzman, the cast is offered some passable action sequences but struggles with weak dialogue and uneven comedy."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,38,"Narratively incoherent and full of cheese and camp, this movie makes it clear that the mummy should have remained dead and buried."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,38,"It’s amazingly relentless in its naked borrowing from other, better horror and sci-fi movies that I was able to keep occupied making a checklist of the movies referenced."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,37,"The big thrills and few laughs are no match for the cumbersome, convoluted story, not to mention the nonexistent chemistry between Cruise and Wallis."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,30,"It’s big, it’s slick, it’s very, very Hollywood, but it’s just not that good a film. It’s not even as much fun – and monster movies, as opposed to horror movies, should be fun – as the 1999 Brendan Fraser vehicle of the same name."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,30,"The Mummy turns out to be a drab, nonsensical affair that squanders its potential for humor, atmosphere and sweep."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,30,"This isn’t a new breed of terror, just another neutered reboot churning all the same mainstream gears."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,30,This “Mummy” is rags that produce no riches.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,25,It's a monster fail.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,25,"The Mummy is so wall-to-wall awful, so cheesy, so ridiculous, so convoluted, so uninvolving and so, so stupid."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,25,"The mayhem in The Mummy feels desperate, mistimed, grueling in the wrong way (the film's violence is infinitely less appropriate for preteens than that of ""Wonder Woman"")."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,20,"The “Mummy” reboot from 1999, directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser, was kind of fun. Monster movies frequently are. This one, directed by Alex Kurtzman and starring Tom Cruise, is an unholy mess."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,16,"The Mummy is a dated, empirically dismal, laughable excuse to kick off a franchise, and it should have remained entombed."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,16,"It’s not that it’s bad, it’s that it never could have been good. It’s an irredeemable disaster from start to finish, an adventure that entertains only via glimpses of the adventure it should have been."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,10,"Cruise seems weariest of all, flogging outdated merchandise he can’t even pretend to believe in. It’s not Cruise that feels ancient; it’s The Mummy."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,0,The Mummy is not your usual lousy movie. It has been made with skill and hits its marks. But those marks are so low and so brazenly mercenary that it doesn’t feel like much of an achievement. It’s not involving.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,0,A movie that goes beyond defying comprehension to being truly incomprehensible.
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,83,"In terms of pure pop entertainment value, you'll be hard-pressed to find a more smartly constructed, beautifully shot, pulse-pounding movie this holiday season."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,80,"Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise deliver on their promise, with a witty, violent take on Reacher that makes up for its lack of height with an abundance of smarts and thrills."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,80,Tom Cruise is in fine form as mysterious tough guy Jack Reacher finally reaches the big screen.
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,80,"A superior thriller, with Cruise and McQuarrie slotting together like a bullet in a clip. Like Reacher on the firing range, the aim isn't always true – but the misses are fractional."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,75,"Werner Herzog, better known as one of the finest living directors, plays a bad guy with Teutonic relish. If he doesn't watch it, he'll have a whole other career for himself playing dead-eyed villains."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,75,"Cruise's Jack Reacher is a loner who doesn't smile, charm, love the ladies, aim his index fingers to the heavens or sing ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling"" in bars. Here he just snarls and kills people. Yes, please, and let's have more of the same."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,75,"This is Cruise's show. And he nails it. The patented smile is gone, replaced by a glower that makes Jack Reacher a dark and dazzling ride into a new kind of hell."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,70,"If you're looking for something lean and unpretentious, you should be pretty satisfied."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,70,"Cruise is definitely too short for the gig, but in this first fight, he proves his tough-guy chops. Outraged Reacher readers can stand down."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,70,"This violent, sometimes brutal suspense thriller was thus quite a surprise, both in how effectively Cruise creates a commanding physical presence despite his lack of size, and for how well the film works in general."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,67,"The bigger problem is that Cruise, as Reacher, has no wit and no style, other than the studiously applied kind. He's so desperate to do everything right that nearly everything he does comes off all wrong."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,65,"Beat by beat, Jack Reacher is just like Child's paperbacks in the best possible way: it's fast, fun, and smarter than it looks."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,65,McQuarrie... is a real writer; his banter has snap and bite. His directorial skills are still catching up with his writing skills; the movie loses steam in the final half-hour.
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,63,Outrageous but entertaining pulp-melodrama thriller.
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,60,"Cruise's tightly controlled performance holds our attention all the way through to the tense finale. Still, McQuarrie's script never gets at the heart of a character who's already inspired such a passionate fan base."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,60,"That Cruise fails to make a case for Reacher's allure, though, has less to do with physical dissonance than it does with the film's inability - stupefying inability, really - to otherwise make a case for the character's originality in a movie so choked with visual clichés and dreadfully moldy dialogue."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,58,"Despite a terrific cast, Jack Reacher comes up empty-handed."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,50,"The whole movie is like an NRA wet dream, with Robert Duvall as a crusty gun-range owner who pitches in to shoot bad guys. Jack Reacher already feels as if it belongs to another era."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,50,Jack Reacher has the distinction of being little more than it initially appears to be: a clumsily condensed mystery/thriller novel made into a movie that offers little more than every other clumsily condensed mystery/thriller novel made into a movie.
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,50,"World-weariness is not really the energetic star's best driving gear. Nor are declarations of menace intended to identify Jack Reacher as a modern-day mythic avenger. When he tells an enemy, through his clenched choppers, ""I mean to beat you to death and drink your blood from a boot,"" the effect is, unintentionally, popcorn-spitting funny. Talk about overreaching."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,50,"An average action film, made slightly better by Cruise, and more bizarre by Herzog, and more watchable by Pike, but still within the average range, a silk purse that still says oink."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,50,This movie is the height of by-the-book dullness.
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,50,"Reacher is so good at everything he does, and Cruise plays him in such a robotic manner, that the movie becomes a bit of a bore: The hero is practically omnipotent."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,50,"In the movie version at least, efforts to render the hero larger than life result in a story that is less than convincing."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,50,"Even when the film is cool, it manages to be wrong."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,50,"Reacher is a brawny action figure whose exploits would have been a good fit for the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone back in the day, but feel less fun when delegated to a leading man like Tom Cruise. The star is too charismatic to play someone so cold-blooded, and his fans likely won't appreciate the stretch."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,50,"Jack Reacher isn't much of a man, and Jack Reacher isn't the story of a man. It's mythmaking for self-satisfied sociopaths."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,42,"Whether blithely comparing American prisons to retirement homes or gleefully recalling the time he chewed off his own fingers in Siberia, the moonlighting German New Wave auteur injects some much-needed black humor into what is otherwise a soporific star vehicle."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,40,"So thrill-less, so chill-less is Jack Reacher that it is unlikely to spark interest, much less controversy."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,40,"Apart from the car chase, the only real fun in Jack Reacher comes from Mr. Herzog and Robert Duvall, called in near the end for some marvelously gratuitous scenery chewing as a gruff former Marine. They enliven the movie's atmosphere of weary brutality for a few moments, but they also call attention to the dullness of their dramatic surroundings."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,40,"Jack Reacher is a wildly ill-advised miscalculation, with Cruise's virtually unstoppable appeal butting uncomfortably against Reacher's alternately cocky and downright crude cynicism."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,38,"The violence is plenty, and pointless."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,38,"The film is as incompetent, manipulative, safe, and disposable as any number of nickel-and-dime actioners, but goes to great, unconvincing lengths to insist it's different."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,25,"Jack Reacher is mostly grim, violent and stupid."
Jack Reacher,7,80070736,25,"Jack Reacher, which Christopher McQuarrie directed from his adaptation of a Lee Child crime novel, is not just another dumb thriller. It's almost peerlessly self-important, weirdly incoherent and eerily smarmy. It's also mysteriously inept, considering that Tom Cruise plays the title role."

Knowing,6.2,79957634,50,"Knowing has about a half-dozen screenwriter credits, which may explain why scenes crash up against one another - smart, stupid, far-fetched, compelling. And the trouble is that Cage walks (or runs) through them all, treating each with the same level of intensely goofy seriousness."

The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,75,"There are a lot of moments to remember in The Golden Child, but the one I will treasure the longest happens when Eddie Murphy gets behind the wheel of a beat-up station wagon and is led by a sacred parakeet to the lair of the devil."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,60,A non-movie that seems to wash over audiences without making any kind of impression. Except for those it does impress.
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,50,"After his triumphant Beverly Hills Cop, Eddie Murphy could have done anything. Why, then, did he choose to head for the mysterious Orient to make a film as rich in mumbo jumbo as The Golden Child? Mr. Murphy's comic skepticism in the face of all this is the film's greatest asset. But it is worn thin by the awareness that not even he seems able to take the adventure seriously, and by the preposterousness and inconsistency of what surrounds him."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,50,"As in Big Trouble, there is much playing around with oriental mythic nonsense: underground caverns, magic daggers, even a trip to Tibet. But where the movie really misses a trick is its inability to reproduce the balletic splendours of martial arts. The surprise is Murphy, who relies more on his undoubted charm than on the stream of wisecracks he usually delivers."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,50,"A strange hybrid of Far Eastern mysticism, treacly sentimentality, diluted reworkings of Eddie Murphy’s patented confrontation scenes across racial and cultural boundaries, and dragged-in ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) special effects monsters, film makes no sense on any level."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,40,"The action sequences are cloddishly orchestrated. And for the most part, the movie simply doesn't make sense."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,40,"A weirdly out-of-scale movie that constantly juxtaposes the trivial and the cosmic, less to comic effect than to a mounting sense of muddle and uncertainty."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,38,"Toying with themes too serious for it and stars too big for it, this fantasy is incalculably less than the sum of it's parts."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,25,"Eddie Murphy's latest is a flabby disappointment. The jokes die, the action curdles. Much of it falls as flat as smashed tinsel."
Earthquake,5.9,79700000,80,"Mark Robson's Earthquake is an excellent dramatic exploitation extravaganza, combining brilliant special effects with a multi-character plot line which is surprisingly above average for this type film. Large cast is headed by Charlton Heston, who comes off better than usual because he is not Superman, instead just one of the gang."
Earthquake,5.9,79700000,70,"For those who have a soft spot for calamity pictures, there's a sense of ritual cleansing afterward. And for some reason, it also made me hungry."
Earthquake,5.9,79700000,60,"Flat, generally laughable hokum, and the film ends up nowhere near as interesting a comment on the psychological aspects of disaster as Juggernaut."
Earthquake,5.9,79700000,60,Awful disaster movie that combined the worst elements of soap opera with special effects (bad matte paintings and the ridiculous Sensurround)--featuring an all-star cast that should have stayed home and waited for a real earthquake.
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,90,"The second Star Trek movie is swift, droll and adventurous, not to mention appealingly gadget-happy. It's everything the first one should have been and wasn't."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,88,"The Wrath of Khan is a top-notch, fast-paced adventure that can be enjoyed equally by fans of the series and those who have never seen an episode."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,88,"Not least among Khan's pleasures is the way it continually veers toward, but never quite crosses, the neutral zone between space opera and interstellar camp. By the end, it becomes simply operatic, with a death scene of surprising emotional power."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,83,This is hands-down the best Trek flick made so far.
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,80,"It's a tale told with considerable warmth and humour, some spiffing explosions and a multiple-hanky act of self-sacrifice to round things off."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,80,"This is one of the most popular in the series, thanks to a high action quotient (including a tensely staged space battle), a suitably campy turn by Montalban, and the shock value of Spock's death. There is some novelty value, too, in the focus on Kirk's family life back on Earth."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,80,"I don't much care if the battles aren't that amazing, because the story doesn't depend on them. It's about a sacrifice made by Spock, and it draws on the sentiment and audience identification developed over the years by the TV series."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,80,"A brisk, handsomely designed film in which its hardware, sturdy as it is, never overwhelms its humanity."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,75,"One leaves the film neither hugely thrilled nor greatly awed, but with a pleasant sense of having caught up with old friends and found them to be just fine, pretty much the way one hoped they would turn out in later life."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,75,"If only director Nicholas Meyer had grasped the implications of his tale more fully and enthusiastically, this might have become a classic piece of cornball SF poetry, but as it stands the tepid acting and one-set claustrophobia take a heavy toll."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,70,"For a major sci-fi release in the Star Wars era, it's surprisingly slow and even maudlin."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,70,"Foregoing the special effects bonanza of its predecessor, it settles for low camp humanoid melodrama."

Pixels,5.6,78747585,50,"The visual effects are impressive, and there is a certain kick to seeing the human characters dodging barrels in a life-size Donkey Kong. But we don’t really care about the humans; here, at least, Q*bert is more endearing than Adam Sandler."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,50,"With a novel idea at its center and some good jokes scattered throughout, Pixels is a relief from the self-serious action films that invade movie theaters at this time of year. For most of the way, it’s good enough to enjoy, and for the rest of the way, it’s good enough to root for. But ultimately, it’s not quite good enough ... to be good enough."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,50,"Pixels has a few inspired action sequences and a handful of laugh-out-loud moments, but overall the special effects are surprisingly average — and the lazy acting by Adam Sandler, the shameless mugging by Kevin James and the hammy performance by Brian Cox don’t help. Not even Peter Dinklage in a mullet can save the day."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,50,"Sporting a flowing mullet and aviator shades, Dinklage perks things up considerably as the story’s comically arrogant bad-boy-turned-good-guy."

Pixels,5.6,78747585,40,"If Sandler can’t find it in himself to be verbally or physically entertaining on set, you start to wonder why he’s there in the first place, although his hollow stare in a number of scenes suggests he may be pondering the same thing."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,40,"On this evidence, maybe the eighties weren't so great after all."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,40,The truly mystifying thing about the movie is how desperately it caters to Gen-X junk nostalgia without bothering to think that maybe those Reagan-era kids have grown up a bit.
Pixels,5.6,78747585,40,"At isolated moments a tolerably amusing send-up of alien invasion disaster movies in which the attackers are video arcade-era renegades arrived to gobble up as many famous landmarks as possible, this one-note comedy runs out of gas within an hour (it is based on a short film) and should have been trimmed to a neat 90 minutes."

Pixels,5.6,78747585,37,"Lazy humor and familiar plotting aside, Pixels at least gets a little mileage out of its affection for the 1980s."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,33,"Neither Sandler nor his listless writers (too many punchlines just sit there and collect flies) seem invested. Whether he’s saving the planet or putting the moves on Michelle Monaghan, Sandler can’t be bothered to raise his pulse above comatose. If he doesn’t care, why should anyone else?"
Pixels,5.6,78747585,33,"Basically it's Ghostbusters meets Wreck-It Ralph, without the sustained charm or wit of either."

Pixels,5.6,78747585,8,"There are legitimate excuses for going to see Pixels. Losing a bet, perhaps. Having a loved one held for ransom. Maybe a serious blow to the head. But none of those (except maybe the last) would allow you watch and actually enjoy the latest cinematic leavings of Adam Sandler."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,0,"As a bad movie, Pixels is extremely dismissible. The ways in which it is bad are hardly fun to pick apart, a la ""The Room;"" instead, they're just banal — the deeply predictable plot, the unfunny jokes, the constant low-level sexism and occasional spikes of racism that permeate the story."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,0,"Every joke is lame, every special effect unspecial."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6,78656813,88,"The new film is a fast, funny, engagingly unpretentious 88 minutes that, moving between martial-arts dustups and random satirical jibes, achieves a more successful mix of action and humor than the first. There is plenty for adults here as well as children."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6,78656813,75,"This lacks the darkness and subtlety that makes the first film so good, and so adult, but its simplified plot and gags will appeal to the under tens."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6,78656813,63,"Neither as fun nor as faithful to the spirit of the original comics. It’s a bigger, slicker movie, but not a better one."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6,78656813,60,"One can have a reasonably amusing time with this predictable sequel, which is a bit longer on action and shorter on wit and character than the original (hence less good, in my opinion), but still diverting and harmless enough."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6,78656813,58,"Retains the essential elements that first turned the world Turtle - the affectionate squabbling between the four, the pantomime villains, the cracking one-liners - and the bigger budget is a blessing."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6,78656813,50,"A reasonably entertaining blend of Three Stooges and Bugs Bunny, using gracefully choreographed martial-arts slapstick without any infantile sound effects."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6,78656813,50,"The humor, which made the first movie appealing to more than just TV kids, is far less adroit."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6,78656813,50,"This slap-- sequel is primarily for the cognoscenti -- that is, for other teen-age mutant ninja turtles, or very small children. The rest of us it happily ignores."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6,78656813,50,"If the Turtles insist on remaining a mainstream box-office attraction, at least they've now had the decency to make a mainstream movie."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6,78656813,50,"Though Turtles II suffers from a lack of novelty and an aimless screenplay, the bottom line is that the pic won't disappoint its core subteen audience."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6,78656813,50,"In most ways, a sequel-as-usual: a little warmer, with slightly less zip and flurry."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6,78656813,50,"If the new film is considerably less imaginative than your average Punch-and-Judy show, it is, nevertheless, a step up from last year's turtle-fest."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6,78656813,50,"Today's kids are learning from the Turtles that the world is a sinkhole of radioactive waste, that it's more reassuring to huddle together in sewers than take your chances competing at street level, and that individuality is dangerous. Cowabunga."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6,78656813,50,The movie slogs along in between combat scenes. Only a precious few of the bantering jokes among the green quartet hold any amusement for those over the age of 10.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,100,One of the best war movies of the past 20 years.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,88,"""Black Hawk Down"" was criticized because the characters seemed hard to tell apart. We Were Soldiers doesn't have that problem; in the Hollywood tradition it identifies a few key players, casts them with stars, and follows their stories."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,88,"The in-your-face style of We Were Soldiers results in a suspenseful, intense, and exhausting cinematic experience."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,83,"A powerful experience, filled with dazzlingly executed action sequences that generally avoid the rock music and drugged-out conventions of ""Apocalypse Now,"" and even exude a certain core of humanity."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,83,"The film's soldiers are more the mom-and-apple-pie, God-fearing lads of World War II movies than the cynical grunts of ""Platoon"" (1986) and ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987)."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,80,You don't really watch the film; you survive it.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,80,"Gibson may get top billing, but it's Sam Elliott who steals all the scenes. As Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley, a man who fires with his own .45 revolver rather than the standard M-16 rifles, he's full of hilariously colorful comments."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,80,"Like the best war movies -- and like martial literature going back to the Iliad -- it balances the dreadful, unassuageable cruelty of warfare and the valor and decency of those who fight."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,80,"It succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides. That might not make it a milestone, but it's a hell of an improvement."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,80,"This is a good film; strong, honest, strikingly photographed (by Dean Semler) and appropriately devastating."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,75,"The writer-director bestows honor -- generously, apolitically -- not only on the dead and still living American veterans who fought in Ia Drang, but also on their families, on their Vietnamese adversaries, and on the families of their adversaries too."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,75,This also is the rare combat movie that deals substantially with mourning widows on the home front.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,75,Probably the best thing you can say about We Were Soldiers is that it does justice to an awful conflict.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,75,"Manages to evoke a complex series of reactions. It both frustrates with its unrelenting sentimentality and impresses with the overwhelming physicality of its combat sequences. These in turn are so powerful they take on a life of their own, sending a message that is probably quite opposite to the one the filmmakers intended."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,75,"Isn't a great movie; I'd say it's barely a good one. But it's a war movie that at least acknowledges the distinction between macho and masculinity, always putting the dignity of the latter over the bluster of the former."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"Gibson has the closest thing to a John Wayne part that anyone's played since the Duke himself rode into the sunset, and he plays it damn well."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"It's square, stiff, and in places cheesy; it's also authentically harrowing -- and blood-showered, blood-drowned."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"Soldiers is righteously explicit about the damage artillery does to human flesh, and for its part, it proves relentlessly unpleasant."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"The battle, expertly shot by Dean Semler, captures the chaos of guerrilla warfare paralleled in ""Black Hawk Down"" and gives the film a scarring documentary realism."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"If the action is graphic and immediate, other aspects of the movie are inexcusably bad."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"One admires Wallace's intentions while despairing at his execution. Yet as clumsily directed as his film is, it inspires compassion for Moore, his men and their foes. And in that, there is merit."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,Some scenes achieve dramatic greatness and emotions that reach to the heart's core. Almost as many have the tinny ring of a badly counterfeited coin.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,63,"We Were Soldiers feels strangely irrelevant -- a well-acted, well-crafted and inconsequential visit to woefully familiar territory."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,63,"Leaves all the real risks to the young warriors at Ia Drang and collects easy dividends on their bravery. In the end, it honors them by paying tribute to itself."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,63,"Fitfully effective as a battle movie, and Mel Gibson does his rugged best to take center stage without seeming to. But the movie is self-righteous in a way that's frequently unseemly."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,63,"Though the questionable motives and bad planning of offscreen characters who far outrank Gibson make it difficult to take at face value one soldier's last words -- ""I'm glad I could die for my country"" -- some viewers will, which may be as the filmmakers intended."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,60,The movie never generates the authority it needs to be all that it can be.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,60,"Ultimately, though, We Were Soldiers fails to bring as much to the table as it at first seems it might."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,60,"Who these brave men were and why they fought disappears under the usual clichés, while the astounding acts of courage that occurred at Ia Drang are lost to the dust and din."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,50,"It was a hellish encounter, as well as a portent of the 10 years to come, and as such deserves far better than Mel Gibson's glower and writer-director Randall Wallace's guns-and-Moses platitudes."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,50,"It's a shame that the book ""We Were Soldiers Once . . . And Young"" fell into the hands of writer-director Randall Wallace (""Braveheart""), a filmmaker who wouldn't recognize subtlety and understatement if they were to attack him in the street."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,50,Rarely have Gibson's tears seemed more fictional than in this supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,88,"This movie doesn't get huffy, it gets laughs."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,80,A highly entertaining and heartfelt action comedy that ought to steal more laughs than any other film this holiday season.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,80,A smoothly engineered crowd pleaser.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,78,"To a one, they nail the humor, all right, but they also, quite crucially, humanize the high concept."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,75,"As far as sophisticated caper flicks go, Tower Heist is oceans away from George Clooney's crew. Compared to other recent comedies, it's pretty light on the laughs."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,75,"It keeps things light and entertaining. And for $8 admission, that's never a bad investment."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,75,"Smoothly made and smart enough. It's not going for too much, but I laughed a lot."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,75,"For what it is - recessionary wish-fulfillment escapism, with a lot of highly skilled familiar faces in its amply qualified cast - it's fun."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,75,"A winning ""Robin Hood and his Merry Doormen"" comedy about getting even. A cast of comedy specialists each deliver their comic specialties to perfection, delivering double-takes and one liners so well that you don't notice how clunky the actual caper in this caper comedy is."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,70,"Tower Heist is overstuffed with actors, and yet Ratner manages to give each of them one or two good moments."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,70,"You can't help leaving the film with the following thought: Man, it's good to see Murphy being funny again."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,70,"More than the marquee names, the second bananas keep the movie bobbing along: Broderick's pharmaceutically vague hangdog act is perfect (""If you need me, I'll be living in this box""), while Peña turns out to be a fine comedian, an enthusiastically yipping dumb puppy here."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,70,A shameless but exuberantly well-done caper comedy.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,63,"Tower Heist is as over-inflated as those Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloons that are featured in the movie's climax. Also similarly, it's entertaining in its own predictable way."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,63,"There's not much to say about a jerry-built caper comedy, except that this one has timeliness on it side, and some first-rate clowns."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,63,An improbably satisfying action comedy.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,63,"Devoting more time to the setup than to the follow-through, Tower Heist doesn't really build suspense so much as it builds impatience - for the thing to be over."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,63,"The movie is broad and clumsy, and the dialogue cannot be described as witty, but a kind of grandeur creeps into the screenplay by Ted Griffin and Jeff Nathanson."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,60,Fun if uneven stuff from Ratner. A welcome return to form for Eddie Murphy and an even-more-welcome turn by the ever-excellent Alan Alda.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,60,"Tower Heist might not be a classic (it's not), but at least for a little while it will make you laugh instead of cry about the current state of affairs, which is more than you can say about a lot of things."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,60,Highly recommended if you want to watch an assortment of rich movie stars feel your pain.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,60,"Boasts an unusually strong cast of actors, who boost the slick screenplay into a satisfying popcorn picture."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,60,"Tower Heist is funny in the way of so many Hollywood comedies, meaning that individual scenes are often crisply written and played, but the whole doesn't add up to anything."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,58,"If this film turns out to be a big success, malls everywhere may want to hire more security."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,58,"Doesn't demand much of the audience, sure, but it doesn't provide much, either.  It's as if an all-star gang of would-be crooks got together to rip off...moviegoers."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,58,"In the end, Tower Heist isn't a black Ocean's Eleven or a bold leap forward for feature-film distribution, just a passable piece of commercial entertainment that falls closer to product than art."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,58,"Tower Heist is the cinematic version of a Trump property: overblinged, eye-catching, and essentially tacky."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,"The combined efforts of this fine ensemble cast make Tower Heist go down easier than it otherwise might, but the film's potential as a buddy comedy is sadly wasted."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,"Tower Heist feigns being an ""Ocean's 11"" for schmucks, but plays like a retread of ""48 Hours."""
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,Tower Heist could and should have been much more. Mr. Ratner goes for the safe bet and the easy score.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,"The type of film with which Mr. Ratner has claimed to be infatuated is itself like a caper - it requires precise execution. Tower Heist is more like that 10-story Snoopy, as he drunkenly bobs along Central Park West."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,Twice as funny as I thought it would be but not half as funny as it could have been.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,The caper is a dud - so stupid and implausible from beginning to end that it's impossible to take it seriously for even the briefest of moments.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,The best thing about this mildly diverting but instantly forgettable comedy is that it seems to have awakened something in Murphy that had laid dormant for much of the past two decades.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,"Back when it was planned as an African-American ""Ocean's Eleven,"" this project might have been edgy, but the script has been whitewashed into a generic caper comedy with pretensions of timeliness."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,"During the heist itself, the suspense is palpable, if only because Christophe Beck's funky score blares its horns so insistently, one can't help but feel anxious. But the laughs don't follow."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,40,"A set piece involving a skyscraper and a sports car proves he can induce sweaty palms, but one nail-biting moment and some much-misssed Murphy mouthiness won't keep you from feeling like you're the one being ripped off."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,40,"Toss everything you can find, starting with roughly diced plots, into the blender, press ""Pulse,"" and pray: such appears to be the method behind Tower Heist."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,25,"Defiantly graceless, Brett Ratner deals in loudness, haplessness, obviousness, and, certainly, crudeness, reminding you of his directorial presence with such inclusions as a scolded kid who tells his disciplinarian to ""suck it."""
Hooper,6.3,78000000,90,"Hooper has all the action that fans of this genre could ask for, plus a whole lot more."
Hooper,6.3,78000000,80,"This time, Mr. Reynolds has made a movie to please fans of all persuasions, and to please them a great deal."
Hooper,6.3,78000000,80,"Individually, the performances in this story of three generations of Hollywood stuntmen are a delight. And Hal Needham’s direction and stunt staging are wonderfully crafted."
Hooper,6.3,78000000,80,"His witty, endearing performance in the title role of Hal Needham's terrific new pick-me-up, Hooper, a rousing and sweet-tempered sentimental comedy about the professional vicissitudes and fellowship of movie stuntmen, should finally secure Reynolds a preeminent position in the affections of contemporary moviegoers."
Hooper,6.3,78000000,70,"A casually assembled Burt Reynolds vehicle, sloppy and loose in an amiable way."
Hooper,6.3,78000000,70,"The rich vein of 'innocent' anarchy running through Burt Reynolds comedy showcases around this time is mined again to good effect as his Smokey and the Bandit persona transmutes seamlessly into the ace Hollywood stuntman of the title, and director Needham (an ex-stuntman himself) slips effortlessly into a lightweight satire of the movie biz and an almost Hawksian action-comedy of male-group professionalism."
Hooper,6.3,78000000,70,"Another mindless exercise in unexciting, unmotivated action sequences punctuated by moments of stupid, redneck, good-ol'-boy humor."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,88,"Man on Fire, with a best-ever Denzel Washington, is the first (nonreligious) sure thing to hit the multiplex this year."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,80,By no means perfect - a twist in the tale overextends its already lengthy running time - but it is terrific fun.
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,75,"For what Man on Fire delivers, it's worth enduring Scott's hyperkinetic visual techniques."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,75,"It's resolutely grim and rather predictable but very compelling, and it offers a commanding star vehicle for Denzel Washington."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,75,"The dead-serious Man on Fire awakens a genuine sense of bloodlust in the viewer. This is a slick, big-budget, A-list production designed to stoke our basest impulses -- to make us long for, and cheer at, bloody, merciless vengeance."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,70,"No one rises above the material, though, except for Walken, who looks pleased with the paycheck and the top-shelf tequila. As a shady lawyer, Mickey Rourke is smooth and funny, but recognizable only by his familiar purr."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,70,"Washington's stoic persona here conceals a volcanic rage, and the cast of pros--including Giancarlo Giannini, Mickey Rourke and Rachel Ticotin--support him with relish."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,67,"Ultimately more bleak and furious than most Hollywood tales of this sort. Man on Fire plays it out to the bloody end, like theres no fire extinguisher in Mexico but for the oceans that hold its borders."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,63,"Man on Fire, which starts off as a good example of super-glitz moviemaking, gradually turns into a movie on fire -- another helter-skelter, big-studio spending spree. Too bad. It could use a lot more of Walken, Fanning and some more honest drama."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,63,"Not too many R-rated revenge pics depend on ""Uptown Girls'"" Dakota Fanning for the stronger scenes. Yet once the 10-year-old star exits the picture, Man on Fire starts blowing a lot of smoke."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,63,"Employs superb craftsmanship and a powerful Denzel Washington performance in an attempt to elevate genre material above its natural level, but it fails. The underlying story isn't worth the effort."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,60,"The film is always watchable, and the confrontations contain undeniable edgy excitement. But even if this weren't a remake, it would be a remake. Hollywood filmmakers have fished these waters so thoroughly that it's virtually impossible to land a big catch."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,60,"One of the more absorbing and palatable entries in the rather disreputable ""Death Wish""-style self-appointed vigilante sub-genre."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,60,"The film as a whole, while possessing a kind of vicious beauty, feels as cold and as embalmed as a corpse."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,60,"Intentional or not, Man on Fire's over-the-top evocation of Christian retribution goes a long way to making this otherwise standard revenge fantasy watchable."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,60,"That there's moral ambiguity to his actions represents some sort of step up from the cinematic norm. Alas, Christopher Walken has very little to do as Creasy's best buddy."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Where Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" radiates freshness and vigor, Man on Fire feels vaguely like something left over from the 1980s, when action heroes were one-note tough guys methodically picking off baddies."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Scott swaddles this fundamentally straightforward revenge story in a jumble of bleary freeze frames, random changes of color saturation and film stock, jump cuts and stuttering montages, splashing text from some menacing word soup onto the resulting collage of chicly disturbing images."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Despite its high craft level and Washington's participation in it, this movie's showy violence is finally as deadening as the over-emphatic violence in these kinds of films generally is."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"A schizophrenic outing from habitually hysterical director Tony Scott (True Romance, The Fan), Man on Fire is a movie of two unreconcilable halves."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"The first hour is sharply directed, character-driven drama that ranks with Scott's best work. Then he lapses into his usual mode - more a bombardier than an entertainer, filling the screen with sadistic violence and arbitrary plot twists. In all, a wasted opportunity."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"It is a good hour too long, although it does boast Christopher Walken."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Seriously, someone needs to stage an intervention, sit Scott down, and tell him that repeated jump cuts, slow-motion shots, and fiddling around with the exposure dont enhance the viewing experience."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Scott apparently decided it was a good idea for his subtitles -- much of the film is in Spanish -- to shimmy across the screen, to fade in and out dramatically, and in general do even more to distract us."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"If your idea of a bargain is two bad movies for the price of one, then shell out for Man on Fire. And don't fret about that incendiary title because this thing is all fuse."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Whenever the movie's point of view turns omniscient, and we're seeing events from the director's vantage point, Man on Fire becomes a blurry, shaky mess."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"On the plus side, the casting is superb - and the acting, too. Although the context is overwrought and the moviemaking over-the-top, Washington acts from the ticker out."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,40,"Scott's latest exercise in assaultive excess nevertheless lingers for two and a half hours, like a drunken houseguest who won't leave."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,38,"Man on Fire is as ludicrous as ""John Q,"" ""Virtuosity"" and ""Out of Time,"" yet substantially more violent, artificial, self-conscious and dull."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,30,"This is a time-tested movie con, but rarely has it been deployed so contemptibly."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,30,"This movie is a predictable, gruesome piece of business."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,30,"The movie's mortal failing is echoed in the religious medal Pita gives Creasy in a gift of innocent, uplifting love: Finding heft or coherence within all the lugubrious agitation is a lost cause worthy of St. Jude."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,25,"Not even within earshot of a masterpiece, Man on Fire, based on its ratio of production costs to quality alone, may prove to be the worst movie of 2004."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,25,"Man on Fire is ponderous and bloated, dragging the Bible and Giannini into its swirling cesspool. Scott can't give the movie any real emotional weight. And Washington gives his first lifeless performance."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,12,"It's dispiriting to see good actors doing smart, solid work with so much unadulterated garbage swirling around them. Scott's art is also death, and we, the audience, are the ones he's jabbing at with his ruthless paintbrush. It's about time someone told him where to stick it."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,75,"What I regret is that all of the expertise lavished on this movie couldn't have been put at the service of a more intelligent story about real firemen, real working conditions, real heroism, and the real craft and art of fire-fighting."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,75,"Fire, as this movie makes clear, is nothing if not photogenic, and Howard has done a beautiful job of conjuring both its danger and its deceptive, primal beauty."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,60,"Not only do the firefighting scenes evoke a feeling of gritty authenticity, but the fire itself really does seem to be alive."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,60,"Visually, [the film] often is exhilarating, but it's shapeless and dragged down by corny, melodramatic characters and situations."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,50,"While Mr. Howard ably maintains a strong forward momentum, Backdraft often feels directionless beneath its overlay of frantic activity. One clear story line would have been worth more than a series of subplots and tangents."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,50,Absolutely marvelous special effects are the salvation and the curse of this movie.
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,40,"Howard, as usual, seems bent on mixing genres to make several movies at once--monster movie, crime movie, coming-of-age movie, and action-adventure movie (among others)--yielding an overall narrative that's not boring but not especially suspenseful or focused either."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,40,"Gregory Widen's script is like a Mad parody played straight, full of ""Scenes We Wouldn't Like to See."""
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,30,"Director Howard is so mesmerized by the flames, he squirts formulaic lighter fluid over everything. A conflagration of hyped-up movie cliches, courtesy of George Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic special effects shop, scalds your face."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,30,"The flames sure look real, but everything else in Backdraft, director Ron Howard's inflatable ode to firefighters, seems about as genuine as a plastic log in an electric hearth. Howard's particular type of schmaltz works well enough in small dabs on comic canvases (Splash, Cocoon, even Parenthood), but pumped up to heroic proportions, the sentimentality is just plain silly - in this case, cheap melodrama on a two-hour jag."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,25,"A noisy, impenetrable and totally nonsensical cogitation on the nature of firefighters and the sizzling ""animal"" they love...We just wish somebody would call 911 for boredom."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,100,"Everything he did in live-action movies with rolling boulders and runaway convoys he does bigger and better - by a factor of ten - in every frame. At the end of two hours, my jaw ached from grinning."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,100,"In a movie year of more than two dozen animated films, this and ""Rango"" tower over all others. Welcome to America, Tintin. It's great getting to know you."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,100,"Such are the timeless joys of the books (and now the movie), this sparkling absurdity and knack for buckling swash under the worst of circumstances."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,90,"Think of The Adventures of Tintin as a song of innocence and experience, able to combine a sweet sense of childlike wonder and pureness of heart with the most worldly and sophisticated of modern technology. More than anything, it's just a whole lot of fun."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,90,"Clearly rejuvenated by his collaboration with producer Peter Jackson, and blessed with a smart script and the best craftsmanship money can buy, Spielberg has fashioned a whiz-bang thrill ride that's largely faithful to the wholesome spirit of his source but still appealing to younger, Tintin-challenged audiencs."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,90,"With the best use of motion capture yet, Spielberg has translated the story of the youthful Tintin, his spirited pooch Snowy and the eccentric Captain Haddock into a first class action adventure that serves as the perfect cross between ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and Spielberg's own ""Indiana Jones"" series."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,88,"The movie comes at you in a whoosh, like a volcano of creative ideas in full eruption."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,88,It evokes Saturday afternoon serials in an age when most of the audience will never have seen one. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed myself.
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,88,"Thankfully, Tintin is Spielberg at his most playful and unpretentious."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,83,"Never quite as resonant as Spielberg's earliest ""Indiana Jones"" films, in which, for all the clamor, it often feels like something real and vital and human is at stake.  But at its best, this film is as joyful as anything in those movies, and that is something of a movie miracle."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,83,"While it's essentially just another slick Spielberg action machine, it's operating effectively on all cylinders throughout."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,80,"This lifelong Tintin fan was more than pleased, even while having to acknowledge that the movie lacks the subtle state-of-the-world commentary that Hergé often smuggled into his creation."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,80,A visually dazzling adaptation of the legendary – at least outside the US – comic book series by Belgian artist Herge.
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,80,"Action-packed, gorgeous, and faithfully whimsical: Hergé thought Spielberg the only director capable of filming Tintin. He was onto something."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,75,"If, like me, you find the movie technique known as motion capture creepy, you might be put off going to see Steven Spielberg's 3-D The Adventures of Tintin."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,75,"The relentless pace is a big part of the fun. Who ever heard of a slow rollercoaster, anyway? You'll have to ride this one in the theater, though. It simply won't be the same at home."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,75,"And if there's a problem with Tintin, it's that it's  too big and booming."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,75,"Everything in The Adventures of Tintin is meticulous - this is a Steven Spielberg movie, after all."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,75,"As a tale of a boy, his dog and their battles with bad guys, it's a treasure."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,75,Being a fan of the character is not a prerequisite for enjoying the film.
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,75,"That's what we get with The Adventures of Tintin - an unplayable video game that's fast-paced and amusing but never coming close to the best director Steven Spielberg has offered when in his ""pure entertainment"" mode."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,75,"Fast on its feet, using 3D and motion-capture animation to kick its comedy-adventure into a superhuman gear, Steven Spielberg's The Adventures of Tintin is a wittily kineticized adaptation of the internationally loved comic books."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,70,"Motion capture, which transforms actors into cartoon characters in a vividly animated landscape, is the technique Spielberg has been waiting for - the Christmas gift, or senior-citizen birthday present that he's dreamed of since his movie childhood."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,70,"Was The Adventures of Tintin a movie that I personally vibed with? Not really. It felt overstuffed and busy, its charm a little calculated, its outsized budget a tad too ostentatiously on display. But it's a rollicking yarn told with scads of invention and energy, not to mention a technical marvel of the first order."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,70,"Although I personally still find the rubber-faced, pseudo-human figures produced by this technique unsettling, the work done by Spielberg and Jackson's animation teams here is exquisite."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,70,"Busy, busy. That's The Adventures of Tintin boiled down to its essence."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,63,"Quite simply, The Adventures of Tintin is a model of modern movie craftsmanship.
It's also, I'm afraid, rather dull."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,63,"Sadly, Herge isn't around to see The Adventures of Tintin, Spielberg's crisp, richly rendered animated adaptation, which could be counted as both a success and a failure. Spielberg has brought Tintin to the big screen all right, but not quite to life."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,60,"The film is spectacularly constructed, from intimate closeups to dizzying chase scenes. But as is often the case with this format, the motion-capture animation feels weirdly lifeless."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,50,"Feels particularly mechanical. The movie isn't a complete waste: it adequately re-creates the comics' Dickensian characterization, and every frame brims with clever details. But once the action begins, Spielberg's incessant, force-fed ""fun"" quickly gets exhausting."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,50,"The motion-capture animation is spectacular..Yet the action grows wearisome as it grinds on, and the film becomes a succession of dazzling set pieces devoid of simple feelings."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,50,"A cracking good adventure film well worthy of classic Saturday-afternoon matinee status. It's also, in myriad ways, a more youthful version of Spielberg's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""...What you don't have, however, is a great movie."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,50,"Hergé was the pioneer of an even-handed style of cartooning with solid lines and no shading that became known as ligne claire, but there is a decided lack of clear lines in this erratic movie adaptation of his work."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,50,"The much-publicized collaboration between producer Peter Jackson and Spielberg sets high expectations. But while the technical artistry is there, the film lacks a sense of magic, intrigue and mystery."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,50,I fear Spielberg and Jackson hitched their wagon to the wrong technological star here.
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,50,"Like the screen Tintin, the movie proves less than inviting because it's been so wildly overworked: there is hardly a moment of downtime, a chance to catch your breath or contemplate the tension between the animated Expressionism and the photo-realist flourishes."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,50,"Adventures is an awesome movie mechanism, but awe comes at a cost. The Tintin character is something like a blank spot at the movie's center, most vivid (unfortunately) as a plucky, priggish motivational speaker when he coaches Haddock out of a drinking problem."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,50,"His (Spielberg) The Adventures of Tintin jettisons character, back story, plot, depth and emotional ties to deliver 100 minutes of beautifully shot mayhem. It's handsome, hectic, heartless and hollow, a shiny Christmas box with nothing but glitter inside."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,50,"Even a filmmaker as dazzling as Steven Spielberg has to create characters who lure us into their point of view, and the trouble with Tintin is that we're always on the outside, looking in. What all that motion can't capture is our hearts."
The Adventures of Tintin,7.3,77591831,50,"Tintin is exhausting, and, for all its wonders, it wears one out well before it's over."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,90,"A classic adventure story that brilliantly transcends its fairly average formula (buttoned-up city gal is softened by devil-may-care chancer while outwitting baddies in foreign lands) through a mixture of perfect casting, lashings of chemistry between the stars and a clever script."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,88,Douglas and Turner make a great double act in this exuberantly directed adventure movie with a great start turn from the always enjoyable De Vito. Good stuff.
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,80,"The filmmakers have devised some clever twists on the earlier films they recall - Raiders of the Lost Ark and Peter Pan among them - and they reserve a good share of the derring-do for their heroine, who's a refreshingly far cry from the helpless ladies-in-distress of old. Under the direction of Robert Zemeckis, the action goes limp and perfunctory at a few key moments, weakening the picture's wallop. But it still packs a healthy amount of self-deflating fun."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,75,"Although comparisons with Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark are inevitable, it is the interplay between Turner and Douglas that gives the film its real charm. Norman and DeVito score strongly in roles that would have been played by Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre 30 years ago, and the whole film has the feel of an old Warner Bros. thriller with broadly comic overtones."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,75,"A silly, high-spirited chase picture that takes us, as they say, from the canyons of Manhattan to the steaming jungles of South America. After all the Raiders rip-offs, it's fun to find an adventure film that deserves the comparison, that has the same spirit and sense of humor."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,75,"Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner are wonderful together. They look great when they're in bed together and they look even better when they're fighting. Throw Danny DeVito into the mix and you've got a very enjoyable, watchable trio of heroes."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,70,"The script is sharp and funny, the direction sure-footed on both the comedy and action fronts, and the whole thing adds up to rather more concerted fun than Indiana Jones' flab-ridden escapade in the Temple of Doom."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,70,"After a fairly promising getaway, Romancing the Stone gradually chases its tail into enough melodramatic dead ends to deteriorate into an expendable runaround, all too easy to shrug off as a miscalculated clone of Raiders of the Lost Ark."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,60,"An elaborately produced, mostly charmless adventure-comedy that intends to make fun of a kind of romantic fiction that's one step removed from what the movie is all about."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,60,"Directed by an unimaginative Robert Zemeckis three years after Raiders of the Lost Ark, it uses Steven Spielberg’s Indiana Jones franchise as the template through which to bolster Douglas’s public machismo."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,50,Director Robert Zemeckis displays such dazzling cinematic know-how that it's genuinely depressing when this film falls off into the usual self-ridicule.
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,50,"Heading for the jungles in her high heels, Turner is like a lot of unwitting screen heroines ahead of her, guaranteed that her drab existence is about to be transformed – probably by a man, preferably handsome and adventurous. Sure enough, Michael Douglas pops out of the jungle. The expected complications are supplied by the kidnappers, Danny DeVito and Zack Norman."
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,6.7,76471046,80,"It features as ghastly a group of interstellar pirates, the Klingons, as ever entered the star log, plus a spectacularly self-destructive planet and plenty of technically adroit and sometimes witty special effects. These are classic directorial occasions, and Nimoy rises to them with fervor, in effect beaming his film up onto a higher pictorial plane than either of its predecessors."
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,6.7,76471046,75,"This is a good but not great Star Trek movie, a sort of compromise between the first two."
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,6.7,76471046,75,"While the sluggish beginning and ending mar this Star Trek outing somewhat, there's still enough here to please fans of the series, and, to a lesser extent, movie-goers in general."
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,6.7,76471046,70,"Leonard Nimoy, who directed this third installment, hasn't matched the playfulness and energy of ''Star Trek II,'' but he's way ahead of the first film, making up in earnestness what he lacks in style. That kind of conviction, while sometimes verging on undue self-importance, goes a long way toward making the material touching."
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,6.7,76471046,70,"Star Trek III has a genuine spirituality, and, at its end, you may be surprised, especially if you're not really a Trekkie, to realize how moved you've been."
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,6.7,76471046,70,"One of the better aspects of Search is that with Spock out of the action, the rest of the crew gets a chance to fill up the vacuum of his absence, and we get a much stronger sense of Kirk, Uhura, Chekov, McCoy, Scotty, and Sulu as a family unit, and not just a bunch of people who work together."
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,6.7,76471046,70,"Impressive visual invention by Nimoy and the reliability of his cast mean that Trek III does more good than harm to a franchise still competing with it's younger, more tehnologically advanced adversaries."
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,6.7,76471046,70,"The third Star Trek film is not as good as the second, but it's reasonably entertaining fare for non-fans."
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,6.7,76471046,67,"An all-time low for the Enterprise and her crew, with Spock dead, the ship condemned, and everyone else looking about 104. Decent SFX, but a little more action wouldn't have gone amiss."
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,6.7,76471046,63,"Though we are largely spared Leonard Nimoy's stentorian presence as a performer, we must endure his miscalculations as a director: the dialogue scenes are often hilariously turgid; the action scenes—when Nimoy can be bothered to descend from his podium and film them—are zanily maladroit."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,88,An action comedy that works. But it’s also a surprisingly poignant romance. This is the summer flick you’ve been waiting for.
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,75,"Diaz has one of the most winning grins in the movies. Basically, what I wanted was more of it. Some of that Cary Grant dialog. More flirtation. More of a feeling the characters, not the production, were the foreground. More of the stars."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,75,"It's both straight-faced spy film and sly spy spoof. That's a difficult balancing act, but director James Mangold gets it exactly right."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,75,"Diaz works that trademark mix of ditziness, sexiness, and brassiness."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,75,"The movie is at its best when the audience is in the dark and, because our perspective is June's and she doesn't know what the hell is going on until well into the proceedings, that's when things are the most entertaining."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,75,"In the end, Knight and Day isn't really about much of anything besides having a good time or perhaps the meaning of Tom Cruise-ness in the universe."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,75,"This movie will undoubtedly be compared to the Brangelina mashup Mr. & Mrs. Smith, and with good reason-it has the same combo of quips and physical tricks, the same somewhat overwhelming chemistry between its two leads."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,75,"It's a quintessential movie hybrid: a romantic thriller with exciting high-speed chases, brisk comedy and exotic scenery."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,75,"If you can settle into its odd, low-key groove, I think you'll find it's a light pop beverage that goes down easy during one of the lamest blockbuster summers in recent memory."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,70,"How you feel about Knight and Day will depend largely on your feelings about Cruise. If you can't divorce his performance from his off-screen antics, well, that's a problem, here and elsewhere. If you're willing to watch what's on-screen and leave it at that, there's fun to be had."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,70,"Stylish, globe hopping, action-packed comedy that starts at full blast and never lets up."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,70,"Yet he just kept going and going, and the slick, proficient Knight and Day is proof that you should never count Cruise out."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,65,"Nothing Cruise does seems to come from the inside -- every eye crinkle, every grimace, every brow furrow seems plucked from the air, collected from the universe around him and bent to do his bidding. Maybe that’s one kind of acting. But it’s not cool. Never will be."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,63,"The story is kind of all over the place, scatterbrained without being madcap (This one feels tinkered with, reshoots, re-edits.)."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,63,"The movie’s a piece of high-octane summer piffle: stylish, funny, brainless without being too obnoxious about it, and Cruise is its manic animating principle."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,60,"It's hardly a perfect film, not even close, but it is the most entertaining made-for-adults studio movie of the summer, and one of the reasons it works at all is the great skill and commitment Cruise brings to the starring role."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,58,"Knight and Day never makes sense from the opening credits. Heck, the title is only half-explained, and not as cleverly as the pun deserves. It's a movie that never gestated beyond the pitch: Glamorous stars in exotic locales, shooting and driving their way to safety through a gantlet of bad guys chasing a MacGuffin."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,58,"In this oddly uninvolving caper, the size of skulls makes its own statement: The producers assume that audience interest in movie stars is bigger than audience interest in characters."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,50,Laziness permeates the film from the inexplicable escapes to the neglected romance.
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,50,"A high-energy, low-impact caper-comedy that labors to bring a measure of wit, romance and glamour to an overworked spy-thriller template."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,50,"Despite its impressive pedigree and unshakable assurance, Knight and Day is nothing more or less than an average popcorn flick."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,50,It strikes me that their teasing and one-upmanship are more brother and sister at play than lovers in heat. Cruise and Diaz are in it for the action rush.
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,50,"Mangold's larger problem is trying to hold together a movie that jerks about in tone as much as it does location, veering between grisly humour and cutesy sentiments."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,50,"Roy is like a meta-Cruise or a Cruise pastiche; even the disturbing, stalkerish aspects of his character seem as if they were constructed from tabloid stories about the actor's marriage, his religious affiliation, his sexual identity."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,50,"With all the money expended on this movie, couldn’t anybody come up with a few good lines in between all the kabooms?"
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,42,"Cruise is thrown into many sticky situations, with legions of trained assassins surrounding him on all sides, but he never once suggests that things aren’t entirely under control. It’s profoundly boring to watch a hero without weaknesses; after all, even Superman has Kryptonite."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,40,"Frankly, I don't like to be bullied, and bullying is exactly what Knight and Day – overly cute and overconvinced of its own cool – does best."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,40,The character of Roy Miller is so quintessentially Cruise-ian that he skirts the edges of self-conscious parody.
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,40,"They make a fun duo, but none of the constituent genres work in this overbearing action-rom-com."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,38,"Knight and Day may well suffice for audiences desperate for the bankable paradox known as the predictable surprise, and willing to overlook a galumphing mediocrity in order to concentrate on matters of dentistry."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,38,"It would also help if they were given some dialogue that was actually funny, or at least more clever than the lines provided to Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl in the distressingly similar ""Killers"" from earlier this month."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,30,"A loud, seemingly interminable, and altogether incoherent entry in the preposterous and proliferating “action-comedy” genre."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,30,"There's never been a particularly crisp line between intense, SUPER-AWESOME Tom Cruise and the characters he plays. In Knight and Day, his age-old cool curdles into motormouthed neediness."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,30,"Cruise and Diaz have worked together before (in Vanilla Sky), but this is their first summer-movie pairing, and their star qualities are so similar--dazzling looks, good comedic chops, complete emotional vacuity--that together, instead of romantic chemistry they generate a sort of giddy, blinding falseness."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,30,"We don’t ask for much from this kind of movie, but Knight and Day tramples on our desire for just enough plausibility to release the fun. It makes us feel like fools for wanting to be entertained by froth."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,25,"Too bad, though, that whenever the characters stand still to talk, Knight and Day induces stupor in the viewer."
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,20,This smug and callous action-comedy is about nothing but teeth.
Knight and Day,6.3,76423035,10,"The source of this movie's energy is near-perpetual desperation. You can see it in Tom Cruise's fixed grin, and in the mad proliferation of unspecial effects."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,100,"Our best fables and fairy tales are the ones that speak truth, and this version of Pete’s Dragon easily takes its place on any short list of the great films for young audiences as a result."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,90,"Experiencing Pete's Dragon is like seeing something thought to be extinct, a creation every bit as magical and mythical as the flying, fire-breathing beast its named after. That would be the straight ahead, unapologetic family film."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,90,"One of the year’s most delightful moviegoing surprises, a quality family film that rewards young people’s imaginations and reminds us of a time when the term “Disney movie” meant something: namely, wholesome entertainment that inspired confidence in parents and reinforced solid American values."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,88,Common wisdom says Hollywood doesn't make this kind of movie anymore. But it's not true.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,88,"A cinematic enchantment, a low-key 1970s-style kids’ movie brimming with sincerity and heart. It’s one of the best films of the year."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,88,"[Lowery] has made a larger, very different movie without losing his instincts, his directorial stealth or his ability to finesse his actors' performances, in this case in the vicinity of an achingly expressive and unexpectedly furry dragon with a little bit of bulldog in him."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,85,David Lowery‘s ease with actors and command of tone make Pete’s Dragon one of the best remakes in recent years.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,83,"If your kids can get through the first five minutes of Pete’s Dragon (which rank right up there with the shooting of Bambi’s mother on the Disney trauma-o-meter), then you won’t find a sweeter family film for the waning days of summer."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,83,Looking for poetry in a live-action family film is usually about as futile as hunting for dragons in your backyard; the vast majority of them wager on the indiscriminate tastes of kids and their dutiful chaperons. But Pete’s Dragon has poetry in spades.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,83,"The way Lowery observes Pete and Elliot’s relationship with nominal dialogue is beautiful. While it’s easy to deride the remake as commercially conceived, the film still feels as rare as the dragon it depicts, wholesome and heartfelt."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,83,"It’s a lovely film that resonates all the more so in a summer of louder, more cluttered movies, and knowing that Disney had the confidence to allow Lowery’s vision to flourish is the icing on the cake."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,83,"In capturing childlike wonder through Pete’s eyes, this film has more than a few heartbreaking moments regarding the definition of a home and the people (or fantastical creatures) that give it life. And by keeping things relatively small-scale, David Lowery’s studio debut retains a personal touch with an unceasing supply of magic running through its lovable, full-hearted soul."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,83,"There may be individual shots in this movie that cost more than the director’s entire pre-existing output, but make no mistake: This is a David Lowery movie — a movie imbued with the same tactile nature and uniquely American flair for myth-making that characterized his Sundance breakthrough, “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints.”"
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,80,"Lowery’s visual world essentially translates the movie’s message, that magic is everywhere if you allow yourself to see it. It may be a cliché and sappy sentiment, and one we’ve seen again and again in movies, but when done right it can be a beautiful one."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,80,"More than anything, this is a slice-of-life tale, whisper-thin but still full of feeling and a generous sense of place. With the world's most adorable dragon at the center of it all."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,78,Pete’s Dragon has the power to breathe fire into the most tepid of souls.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,75,"For me, a grown-up spoiled by Pixar, Pete’s Dragon seemed sweet but slow and a little bland. My guests, entranced by the friendly dragon and the film’s 3D depictions of flight, thought otherwise."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,75,"The movie is something of a shaggy dog hangout film, albeit one that literally features a shaggy dragon."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,75,"A surprisingly effective work of family entertainment that hits all its marks, and then some."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,75,"Thanks to Lowery's humanizing magic, Pete's Dragon is that rare family film you really can take to heart."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,75,"Lowery’s update turns out to be one of the summer’s best surprises, a gorgeous, magical reworking that deftly strikes that once-elusive balance between contemporary and quaint."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,75,"If the cast were less likeable, the predictability of the story might become wearisome. (Of course, it’s not likely to be predictable if you’re 9.) But all the actors, especially young Fegley and Laurence, engage us."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,75,"There should be more American family movies like Pete’s Dragon. Since there aren’t, we should get behind this one."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,75,"All one needs to grasp is the hope and inherent magic of a kid and a dragon being BFFs, then let the feels flow from there."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,70,"After half an hour or so of ... stutter steps, Pete's Dragon starts working on you, much like those gold standards of the boy-and-his-otherworldly-friend genre, ""E.T."" and ""The Iron Giant."""
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,70,"Pete's Dragon is a gentle, understated family adventure, one that feels notably unlike the simplistically sentimental product the Disney imprimatur might lead you to expect."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,70,"Mr. Lowery is very good with actors, and he lets much of his film unfold at a pace that may, in these frenzied times, seem rather leisurely. I thought the pace was fine, and admired him for giving his characters time to breathe. Elliott breathes fire, and the film around him breathes humanity."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,70,"Pete’s Dragon sports an undeniably old-fashioned, even slightly square demeanour, but even when that aura feels a tad forced, Lowery’s loving care gives the movie a likeable, small-scale charm."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,63,"It’s a lovely film, stately, sylvan and slow. It would take an insensate child and a very cynical adult to not fall for at least some of its charms."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,60,"Lowery stumbles, working too hard to squeeze a response from us."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,60,Pete’s Dragon is a good movie. But it could have used a little more of the magic its characters are searching for.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,60,"Where the original was a goofy, campy bit of stylized storytelling, Lowery's becomes a nicely realized, feel-good love song to fantasy and magic, buoyed by solid, updated visual effects, a strong cast (including two wonderful child actors) and a throwback sense of wide-eyed wonder."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,60,"This being a kids film, there is a ‘message’ – about the destruction of nature. But the eco theme genuinely works with the film’s wonder at nature."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,60,"What Pete's Dragon lacks in original plot, it makes up for in heart"
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,60,"Those with fond memories of a gentler era of boy-and-his-insert-critter-here heartwarmers are bound to welcome Dragon’s old-fashioned vibe. But it still feels almost perverse to place all of Weta’s hi-tech wizardry at the disposal of a film so stubbornly, studiously lo-fi."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,60,Strong performances and direction make the most of a lightweight tale.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,50,Fegley’s heartbreaking performance is fused onto a marshmallow. Lowery overcompensates for the darkness in the script by making everything else soft and squishy.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,50,The battle here is between the sincerity of the filmmakers’ intentions and the cynicism driving the film’s creation.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,50,"This sentimental, nearly genteel movie demonstrates there’s a world of difference between invoking magic and conjuring it."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,50,"Despite the vastly improved visuals, the new film is just as soft-hearted — and, unfortunately, just as mush-headed — as the earlier one."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,50,It abandons its subtlety en route to becoming a moralistic screed about the preservation of the nuclear family.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,40,"Haphazard plotting and seriously undernourished character development aside, none of the emotional stakes have been planted deeply enough to elicit audience involvement in young Pete’s plight."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,90,"Even when Conspiracy Theory is jammed or rushed or overly jittery, Gibson's command--of Jerry's fractured psyche, his freak perceptions, and his ardor--gives the picture blue-eyed soul."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,75,"The good guys metamorphose into bad guys and back into good guys with dazzling efficiency in Brian Helgeland's disturbing, comic script."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,75,"Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts contribute major star power to the uneven tale, but it never becomes as convincing as a real conspiracy theory should."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,70,"With it's many knotty connections and complex exposition, the movie is definitely something of a muddle, but for that matter so are most conspiracy theories."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,67,"You're set up for when director Richard Donner -- who worked with Gibson on all three audience-pleasing Weapons -- switches the movie from a really interesting, jittery, literate, and witty tone poem about justified contemporary paranoia (and the creatively unhinged dark side of New York City) to an overloaded, meandering iteration of a Lethal Weapon project that bears the not-so-secret stamp of audience testing and tinkering."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,63,"Unfortunately, the parts of the movie that are truly good are buried beneath the deadening layers of thriller cliches and an unconvincing love story."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,60,"Though it tries to be different, with hair's-breadth escapes that don't depend on implausible stunts or Bondian-scale explosions, Conspiracy Theory is an uneasy mix of laughs and thrills; suspense and soap."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"With a plot that thickens like congealed stew, this movie about a harmless nutbar, an attorney and a cabal can leave you lost in banality."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"Taking its cue from the notion that American society is obsessed with covert political intrigues and machinations, Conspiracy Theory is an interesting but flawed thriller in which the wildly paranoiac is something really real."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"The only sneaky scheme at work here is the one that inflates a hollow plot to fill 2 1/4 hours while banishing skepticism with endless close-ups of big, beautiful movie-star eyes."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"In the end, Conspiracy Theory fails to work as an action film, a romance, or a mystery -- all of which it aspires to be."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"Instead of a scalding brew of mirth and malice, served black, Donner settles up a tepid latte, decaf."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"Conspiracy Theory doesn't know whether it wants to be a comedy, a political thriller, a romance or a satire."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,It's just a simple thriller whose goal is little more than to keep moving.
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"The film isn't really about much and so feels patchy and forced, with elements more calculated than inspired, more urgent than exciting."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"Roberts and Gibson form a ""pas de deux,"" two lonely urbanites fighting vague yet common enemies in a plot that never quite comes together."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"Not a terrible movie exactly, just a dark, edgy idea relentlessly worn down into mildly diverting blandness by the mega-wattage presence of stars Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"A below-par star vehicle for Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts, Conspiracy Theory is a sporadically amusing but listless thriller that wears its humorous, romantic and political components like mismatched articles of clothing."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,40,"It is one of those soap bubbles of a film, fleeting, ephemeral, seemingly there when it is not. As you leave the theater, it diminishes with each step, collapsing into shards of imagery and sensations of movement. It's the film that never was."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,30,The story--written by Brian Helgeland and directed by Richard Donner--was just dumb.
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,30,"It might even have made a good film, but it hasn't. In the hands of stars in denial about their stardom and a director who can't be bothered to take things seriously, it has come out implausible and unsatisfying, a comic thriller that is not especially funny or thrilling."
Star Trek: Generations,6.6,75668868,90,The pleasure of any Star Trek movie lies in experiencing the familiar mixed with the inventive.
Star Trek: Generations,6.6,75668868,75,"Star Trek: Generations is a successful entry in the series, and a darn good film on its own."
Star Trek: Generations,6.6,75668868,70,"Generations spends its running length searching for, and never completely finding, its niche."
Star Trek: Generations,6.6,75668868,67,"Fortunately, director David Carson and screenwriters Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga (all of whom have served in the Star Trek universe) keep the longueurs to a minimum. Whenever you feel like beaming up (or is it out?), they switch scenes."
Star Trek: Generations,6.6,75668868,67,"""Generations"" is predictably flabby and impenetrable in places, but it has enough pomp, spectacle and high-tech small talk to keep the franchise afloat. And in an age when much fancier futuristic effects can be found elsewhere, even its tackiness is a comfort."
Star Trek: Generations,6.6,75668868,63,A flawed but funky adventure.
Star Trek: Generations,6.6,75668868,63,"Going boldly where no one has gone before is not what it used to be. Contentedly settled into a prosperous middle age, the ""Star Trek"" series now seems more comfortable retracing its own footsteps, carefully offering its horde of fans interludes that aspire to do no more than fit snugly into the patterns of the past."
Star Trek: Generations,6.6,75668868,63,"Here is a movie so concerned with in-jokes and updates for Trekkers that it can barely tear itself away long enough to tell a story. From the weight and attention given to the transfer of command on the Starship Enterprise, you'd think a millennium was ending - which is, by the end of the film, how it feels."
Star Trek: Generations,6.6,75668868,63,At least the special effects and outer space vistas are more handsome than usual.
Star Trek: Generations,6.6,75668868,63,"Devoted Trekkers will have to see it to keep abreast of the ships’ logs, but Saturday night at the flicks fun-seekers are apt to concur this one only fires on stun."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,83,"2 Guns is a movie based on smart callbacks and sly flip-flops of loyalty, regularly interrupted by spasms of well-staged violence."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,83,2 Guns is a much-needed reminder that the best summer surprises can come when you least expect them.
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,80,"Could this be the late-emerging hit movie of summer 2013? No chance, although if this was August 1987, a time when we allowed action films to be smart on their own dumb terms, it might have cleaned up."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,80,"For a movie with so many twists in it, 2 Guns never really jerks us around. This is what some summer movies should be like — clever in a stupid way, and stupid in a clever way."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,80,"Pure charisma is sometimes the best special effect. That’s what Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg bring to 2 Guns, and after a season full of superhero duds, they deliver a crucial dose of cool."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,79,"In a season stuffed with empty eye candy, 2 Guns comes along as something of a welcome burrito — plenty satisfying and hardly nutritious."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,75,"With a sharp and funny if sometimes convoluted script by Blake Masters and slick, pulpy direction from Baltasar Kormakur, and of course that first-rate cast, 2 Guns rises above standard action fare."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,75,"You've seen all this before, and many times. 2 Guns works because it's essentially several riffs on familiar material. Cliché is not a bad thing if it's done right."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,75,"Wahlberg, whose dim-bulb act was over-exposed in Pain and Gain, fares better here in a more heroic role. Stig is a hothead and a narcissist, but he’s also just a little bit smarter than he looks. The same goes for 2 Guns as a whole."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,75,"The director mixes the colors of his palette carefully. He uses (but never overuses) slow-motion, aerial shots, extreme close-ups and quick cuts, avoiding any self-consciously “stylish” display. He varies the pace of scenes and the angle of shots enough to keep the movie flowing, but we never feel we’re watching someone show us how clever he is."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,75,"The movie is loud, fun, quick moving, and features some nice acting turns."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,70,Mr. Kormakur sets and keeps up a fast rather than frantic pace that never runs the movie off the rails even when the story nearly does.
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,70,2 Guns is both enjoyable trash and a fascinating snapshot of Hollywood’s current mentality when it comes to the United States government.
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,70,"Kormákur lets his stars balance the buddy-movie levity with just enough dramatic weight to keep it grounded, and his directing style seems like a conscious corrective to the disorienting cutting and obvious CGI effects that have come to dominate Hollywood action films."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,70,"The picture survives its excesses thanks to winning chemistry between stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg, who animate banter-heavy dialogue and click so well one wonders why they haven't shared the screen before."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,70,"Kormakur shows he knows his way around an action movie better than most, keeping the pace quick, the banter lively and the old-school, mostly CGI-free thrills delivering right on schedule."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,67,"Maybe it’s just an expression of relief after a summer of superheroes and fantasy scenarios, but 2 Guns is a refreshing blast."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,63,"With border crossings and familiar buddy-cop movie tropes (think Lethal Weapon, think 48 HRS, think The Heat), the Wahlberg-Washington express hits lots of comfortably familiar notes. And more than a few viciously uncomfortable ones, too."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,63,"The actors — including Patton as Bobby's DEA colleague and sometime fling — cannot act what is not there. But with Washington, Wahlberg, Olmos and Paxton around jockeying for dominance, the standoffs have their moments."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,60,"This does a serviceable job homaging '80s actioners but not a whole lot more. Go for the explosions, zone out for the plot."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,60,"Washington and Wahlberg are an effective double act in an intermittently exciting thriller with more twists than it needs. We’d love to see them partnered again, though perhaps as characters."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,60,"Wahlberg and Washington are so good together, quips flying as fast as lead, that much is forgiven."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,58,It’s essentially a buddy-cop romp with the usual assortment pack of graphic gruesomeness.
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,58,"As in ""Contraband,"" Kormákur offers a hint of a political statement, in this case about the inherent potential for corruption whenever competing government agencies are operating in international territory. But it doesn’t quite make it. On almost every level, 2 Guns is content to be as flavorless and forgettable as its title."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,50,"Hypermacho but tongue-in-cheek, the first 20 minutes of 2 Guns are enormous fun."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,50,"By its conclusion the story has worked so hard to be twisting and clever that it runs out of steam and becomes outlandish, marked by a surplus of violence — too often casual and gratuitous — for what essentially is a buddy cop movie."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,50,The movie has style but increasingly little sense.
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,50,Savvy filmgoers will know they are getting a stale product as soon as they see the wrapper: one of those vintage muscle cars that screams “stakeout.”
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,50,"The phrase “casting is everything” has never felt truer than it does with 2 Guns, an unremarkable, standard-issue shoot-em-up that rests entirely on the charisma of its two stars."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,50,"Hell, I really meant to at least like 2 Guns. But I couldn't. The movie just didn't make the extra effort."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,50,"Viewer/character solidarity only holds up for so long, and the film falls hard into twisty, nonsense territory, skipping over its stronger themes in the process."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,50,"This is a here today, gone tomorrow trifle, albeit one with lots of gunplay. In midsummer, that may be enough, but it's still a shame that 2 Guns shoots so many blanks."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,42,"There’s nothing about 2 Guns that doesn’t feel prefab, like someone poured a packet of Insta-Movie into a glass of water."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,40,"There is a fair amount of not sufficiently witty or lovable banter, and Paula Patton gets to play Katharine Ross to their Butch and Sundance. She really has nothing to do except pose fetchingly in her underwear. Not much firepower."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,40,"Complications escalate to a tiresome degree, leeching the fun from the movie, which is slung together with cold competence (and not much more) by jobbing Icelandic maverick Baltasar Kormákur."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,40,"While Washington and Wahlberg help make sure the flawed 2 Guns isn't too bad, it's hard not to think that it could have been better."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,40,"When does banter turn to blather? In the case of this action adventure, which was directed by Baltasar Kormákur, it's when you realize that keeping track of the barely fathomable plot isn't worth the bother."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,40,"Though individual set pieces are well done, the film inevitably leaves an empty taste behind it once it's done."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,40,"They’re cute together, these two big stars, but the film around them, a sort of Tarantino lite, is desperately empty."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,40,"2 Guns quickly degenerates into boilerplate Hollywood sound and fury, complete with a climactic Mexican standoff that revolves around a massive, burning pile of money. Irony, thou art lost."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,38,Not every movie can come from the heart: This one is from the crotch. But what’s left for the sequel? Maybe it’ll feature Mark and Denzel sporting matching leather codpieces or giving each other bikini waxes. We can only hope.
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,37,"2 Guns feels like it’s all been done before, whether by John Woo, Michael Bay or any number of their CGI-happy clones."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,25,"It's a complete mess, the spectacle of filmmakers blowing up their movie and everything in it, because they can't think of anything else to do."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,100,"Bold and stirring with impeccable production values, The Last of the Mohicans is a memorable motion picture adventure, and one of the best films of the year."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,100,"The first hour of The Last of the Mohicans plays like a convoluted history lesson. I appreciate that Mann has enough respect for the audience's intelligence to sketch in this briar patch of conflicting loyalties. But he outlines the interlocking factions without really making it clear, in dramatic terms, what each one stands for."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,90,"When this historical adventure kicks in, it's thrilling in the way old-fashioned epics used to be, but its romanticism has a fierce, violent physicality that gives it a distinctively modern stamp."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,88,[The Last of the Mohicans] blends pure adventure with a compelling central romance.
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,83,"The Last of the Mohicans is a striking mixture of the ersatz and the genuine. In other words, it’s vintage Hollywood. It’s also a smashingly entertaining and satisfying adventure."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,"Mann, who's best known for such urban crime dramas as ""Vice"" and ""Manhunter,"" is equally at home whether the chase concerns a cigarette boat or a birch-bark canoe. He brings the same flair pairing action and style to The Last of the Mohicans, an attempt to resurrect and redefine the American hero."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,"The Last of the Mohicans isn't a classic, but it's one of the most exciting action pictures to come along in recent memory."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,"The Last of the Mohicans rarely flinches in depicting the eye-for-an-eye savagery of war. Although not explicit in the way you might expect, it nevertheless requires you to screw your courage to the sticking place. Perhaps that's a tribute to its ability to take you along its journey without much effort – real enough to elicit a visceral reaction, romantic enough to remind you it's only a movie."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,The Last of the Mohicans is not as authentic and uncompromised as it claims to be -- more of a matinee fantasy than it wants to admit -- but it is probably more entertaining as a result.
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,"Drawing upon the novel with merciful selectivity, and adding such a contemporary flavor that the film's woodsmen often have a laid-back air, Michael Mann has directed a sultrier and more pointedly responsible version of this story."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,"The Last of the Mohicans comes at you like a tomahawk. Hard, fast and brutal, it slashes at your throat and just about leaves you for dead. Undeniably exciting as this definitely is, however, its impact comes at the expense of some of the gentler virtues, qualities that even top-drawer barn-burners really shouldn't ignore."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,75,"For me, The Hitman’s Bodyguard is the epitome of what a summer movie should be. There’s sufficient spectacle to satisfy the “wow!” factor, some hammy performances by actors in their wheelhouses, a half-dozen solid laughs, and a script that, if not likely to be called “clever” or “smart”, doesn’t demand a frontal lobotomy to be enjoyed."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,75,"Reynolds is playing what amounts to the straight man to Jackson’s bad boy, and the back-and-forth between the two, with his character stewing and steaming in exasperation at the killer’s taunts, gives The Hitman’s Bodyguard its special fizz."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,75,"Salma Hayek stands out in a comic role as the hitman’s impossibly vulgar, assertive wife. It’s also worth noting that there are lots of car chases here, and they actually aren’t boring. That qualifies as a rare achievement."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,75,"It’s an obvious formula, but when the movie sticks to it, it works well enough; Reynolds and Jackson have pretty decent chemistry."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,70,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard is not the best movie of the summer, but it is easily its most pleasant surprise. An unapologetically violent and vulgar buddy action comedy, it updates the template set forth by Lethal Weapon and particularly Midnight Run for a new era."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,70,"It’s exactly the movie it promises to be, but more so. It’s wilder, more hilarious, more giddily irresponsible — it’s the hard R action comedy that kids sneaking into it might imagine it’s going to be, minus Seventies- and Eighties-style nudity."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,70,A delightfully ridiculous screwball action comedy.
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,65,"The film knows what it is, and lives in its ridiculous skin with an infectious, gleeful attitude. Unfortunately, The Hitman’s Bodyguard also doesn’t know when to say goodbye, and as a result, overstays it’s welcome."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,63,"While no one is going to mistake The Hitman’s Bodyguard for high art, it will please those in the mood for late-summer fun."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,63,"Even by the junk-food standards of summer action comedies, The Hitman’s Bodyguard is overlong, over-violent, and over the top."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,60,"As the word “m#th&rf$ck*r” loses meaning, you can’t help but appreciate a wholly predictable – yet unapologetically confident – action goof that’s far funnier than it should be."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,60,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard is a movie for anyone who just wants to see Samuel L. Jackson curse, Ryan Reynolds smirk and Salma Hayek kick butt while looking absolutely incredible. Not that there’s anything wrong with that."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,60,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard is not exactly killing it, but coasts on the charisma of its central stars."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,60,"Hitman's Bodyguard offers more than enough shoot-'em-up to keep multiplex auds munching their popcorn, but sharper talents behind the camera might have made it considerably more enjoyable."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,58,"Director Patrick Hughes' instinct isn't to find dark humor in violence, only to graphically depict it. There's a sadistic edge to The Hitman's Bodyguard that's unbecoming to its comedy."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,58,"It’s not an easy movie to love and it’s not an easy movie to hate either. It’s annoyingly, persistently just okay."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,58,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard, which bears the tagline “Get triggered” and is essentially a dumber, tackier ""Midnight Run,"" was destined to be one of those Neanderthalic, faux-merican EuropaCorp action movies, like ""The Transporter"" or ""From Paris With Love"" ­­— except fate fumbled, and the film ended up as a coasting-on-star-power Hollywood programmer directed by The Expendables 3’s Patrick Hughes."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,58,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard is strictly an Economy Coach experience, but it’s brainlessly fun enough in a late-’90s Brett Ratner buddy-comedy kind of way."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,55,"The cast seems game, and perhaps they realize it’s on them to elevate the material, so the scenes between Reynolds and Jackson have some genuine snap to them, even though the dialogue and characterization are barely memorable."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,This is Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote territory. How are we to reconcile such images with righteous vengeance wreaked on a genocidal war criminal? Not even a busload of popes could make moral sense of this one.
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard would have been much funnier because, on paper, Tom O’Connor’s script was probably a scream. What adds to the unevenness of the whole affair is a propensity for extreme violence that just seems incompatible with what is ostensibly a comedy."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,"The combination of the two showcases fun chemistry and antics, although surrounded by a formulaic narrative that action junkies have all seen before."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,Reynolds and Jackson make this summer lunacy go down easy with their banter and bullet-dodging skills. They're the only reason that The Hitman’s Bodyguard doesn't completely sink into the generic quicksand from whence it came.
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,The result is passable stupidity leaning hard on its wily leading men. The movie’s also pretty galling in its unceasing brutality for laughs.
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,"An end-of-summer burst of adrenaline, The Hitman’s Bodyguard promises nothing more and nothing less."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,"The tone is playful, to be sure, but it’s hard to see past the collateral damage. Blame it on the times. Make no mistake, all of this could be forgiven if The Hitman’s Bodyguard had enough laughs. It does not."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,"An assembly line of ostensibly “hip” gestures and snarky attitude, The Hitman’s Bodyguard wants very badly to be a naughty, R-rated guilty pleasure. Nobody tell its makers that it’s mostly just mildly boring."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,It occupies its genre niche — the exuberantly violent Euro-action movie-star paycheck action comedy — without excessive cynicism or annoying pretension.
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,Laugh-out-loud funny? Yes. It’s just a pity that the “more is better” bodycount sours the picture long before its drawn-out ending spoils the punchline.
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,"By betting everything on the chemistry between its two leads, a tired formula and by-the-numbers action, The Hitman’s Bodyguard misses the mark."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,42,A half-assed action-comedy that lacks the courage to commit to its own premise.
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,40,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard is strangely soulless, particularly for a movie that wants to be about murder, morality, and revenge. Those elements are there only to serve up the appearance of a smart film, when The Hitman’s Bodyguard would have been better served by sticking to pure action and stupid humor."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,40,"For an action-comedy, its timing is lousy."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,40,"The leads work hard and there’s an attempt to add fun via cheesy music and Salma Hayek, but hackneyed dynamics, half-baked action sequences and saying “m#th&rf$ck*r” does not a Shane Black make."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,40,"Two characters, who you won’t like, insulting each other for two hours. Give it a miss and rewatch Midnight Run instead."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,38,"There’s nothing and no one to like in The Hitman’s Bodyguard. This is one loud, generic, forgettable late summer action flick."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,38,"Because it so consistently fails to meld its comic sensibilities and love stories with its generic action premise into a seamless whole, The Hitman's Bodyguard sometimes just appears to be parodying the sort of mess it ends up being."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,37,"Despite all the mayhem, The Hitman’s Bodyguard is a surprisingly bland dish."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,30,"The whole film feels slightly grubby and low-res, like it’s been languishing in private mode on the filmmakers’ pre-HD YouTube page since 2008."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,30,"Uncertain whether to be a cheerfully weightless killing spree, an earnest odd-couple comedy or, most hilariously, a straight-faced Eastern European political thriller, Tom O’Connor’s screenplay falls back on shopworn snark and half-baked bromantic attitudes."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,25,"Interspersed with the gore is banter between the leads, who fall into a predictable odd-couple pairing of fussy (Reynolds) and gonzo (Jackson). Their rapport is amusing, but entirely, clumsily incongruous with the thuggish mayhem all around them."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,20,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard simply doesn’t put in the effort, with the result that almost every aspect of the film proves wildly irritating, from its central odd couple to the dubious green-screen work that regularly has them pulling nonchalant faces in front of exploding buildings."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,75,"Eragon may not be a big Oscar contender, but in a movie season filled with blood diamonds, fascist soldiers and Idi Amin, it provides a much-needed afternoon of PG-rated family-friendly adventure."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,63,"Eragon is a bit cheesy, but I rather liked it. It's sincere cheese... The special effects -- which include glowing-eyed heroes and villains, and flights over the mythical land of Alagaesia depicted in ""dragon vision"" -- are refreshing in their slightly out-of-date air."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,63,"It's a pleasant enough fantastical adventure, but it does feel naggingly derivative."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,63,"This likable adventure is basically ""Lassie"" with scales and should appeal to the books' large audience of adolescent boys."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,63,"I wish Eragon's cinematography were crisper, the music less Wagnerian, and the acting more consistent. But this movie isn't for me. It's for my 10-year-old, for whom the subtleties of narrative, photography and acting mean nothing."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,58,"The holiday movie season's only epic fantasy adventure, certainly gets no points for originality. It's such a clone of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" it probably could lose a plagiarism suit. There's also a heavy dash of ""Harry Potter."" All bases are covered."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,50,You're most likely find that Eragon is less a gem and more cubic zirconia -- nice to look at but not as preeeecioussss as its recent fantasy bretheren.
Eragon,5.1,75030163,50,"There is little complexity in the social, cultural or political shape of this world. So this film, directed by visual effects master Stefen Fangmeier and written by Peter Buchman in a straightforward manner, cannot escape the rote nature of such a fantasy."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,50,"The mess that's been made with all this money is maddening. This isn't economical moviemaking. It's a deluxe trailer for ""Eragon 2."""
Eragon,5.1,75030163,50,"It's not only the mythical, mind-reading creature at the story's center that prevents the film from taking flight. A worn-out plot and a novice actor also contribute to the disappointment."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,50,An exercise in competence guaranteed neither to offend the initiated nor to charm anyone else.
Eragon,5.1,75030163,50,"A sword-and-sorcery saga that desperately wants to be another ""Lord of the Rings,"" Eragon succeeds in being only the palest of imitations."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,42,"Director Stefen Fangmeier, a well-regarded special-effects man and second-unit director (""Master and Commander,"" ""Galaxy Quest"") does a superb job visualizing the CGI dragon. But Fangmeier is working with a script without a single memorable line and far too many characters and creatures with silly names."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,42,"If Eragon proves anything, it's that not all dragons produce magic."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,42,"Though the movie, which was adapted from a book written by Christopher Paolini when he was a teenager, aims high by ripping off the classics (even down to Eragon’s murdered uncle), what it most recalls are the cheesy lost sword-and-sorcery epics from the '80s, awful movies in the vein of ""Yor: The Hunter From the Future"" and ""The Blade Master."""
Eragon,5.1,75030163,42,"Appropriating all the external trappings of big-budget fantasy but none of the requisite soul, this leaden epic never soars like the CG-rendered fire-breather at the core of its derivative mythology."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,40,"If some of the characters won't be returning for the sequel, no matter. In all likelihood, neither will the audience."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,40,"Though I don't think giving it a cuddly human personality and the vocals of Rachel Weisz helps much, the thing itself, part dog, part fish, part weasel, part dinosaur, is a terrific illusion, and the technical team manages to really sell the idea of flight. Too bad the acting is so lame, the story so derivative and the thing so long."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,40,"Eragon is likely to center on its place among the likes of ""Dragonheart,"" ""Reign of Fire"" and the rest of the mediocre dragon flicks."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,40,"With the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy completed and the next ""Chronicles of Narnia"" movie two years away, fantasy aficionados needing a Yuletide fix may have to settle for this dull sword-and-sorcery epic."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,40,Turns out to be as heavy and earthbound as an injured dragon.
Eragon,5.1,75030163,38,"When the studio tells us that parental guidance is suggested, does it occur to them that they should have taken their own advice?"
Eragon,5.1,75030163,38,"The only interesting character is the dragon, who grows from an adorably dependent baby to a protective, intelligent adult voiced by Rachel Weisz."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,38,It's hard to imagine anyone having the patience to sit through this movie except perhaps a handful of 11-year old boys seeking vicarious wish fulfillment.
Eragon,5.1,75030163,38,"In a time of darkness, under the evil reign of John Malkovich -- who sits upon a throne in a different sound stage from the rest of the cast -- a hero shall rise. But lo, there will be little rejoicing, for this dragon rider (newcomer Edward Speleers) is but a nancy boy, about as imposing as Lance Bass, and somehow in possession of the only soap and clean clothes in all the land."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,30,"Dear George Lucas: What gives with this Eragon jazz? I mean, gee whiz, did you seriously think that we wouldn't recognize you, the Great Man, as the guiding, um, FORCE behind this dull retelling of ""Star Wars""?"
Eragon,5.1,75030163,20,"Technically competent, but essentially a fantasy movie that mistakes industrial light for magic. As dragon movies go, Dragonslayer, Reign Of Fire and even Dragonheart can rest easy."
Eragon,5.1,75030163,20,"Eragon is laughably bad, mind-bogglingly derivative, and easily one of the worst movies of the year."
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,7.3,74888996,90,"There are no signs of waning energy here, not even in an Enterprise crew that looks ever more ready for intergalactic rocking chairs. The principals' enthusiasm for their material has never seemed to fade. If anything, that enthusiasm grows more appealingly nutty with time."
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,7.3,74888996,88,"Star Trek VI surprises us only by completely satisfying our expectations, by giving us exactly what we want from a ""Star Trek"" picture. It's not startling or revelatory, only witty, ebulliently good-natured and close to ideal."
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,7.3,74888996,88,"Star Trek VI is just pleasantly diverting, business-as-usual hokum."
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,7.3,74888996,80,"Star Trek VI is an improvement over its immediate predecessor, but it lacks the energy and thrills supplied by some of the lower-numbered sequels. The original crew of the Enterprise is apparently fated to fade away rather than going out in a proverbial ""blaze of glory."""
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,7.3,74888996,80,One of the dullest films of the sextet thus far.
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,75,"Four Brothers works as an urban thriller, if not precisely as a model of logic."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,75,Preposterous yet solidly entertaining.
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,75,"If you can overcome the graphic nature of its casual violence, it is a lot of fun. The banter among the brothers is well-written and has a genuine fraternal feel to it. And the chases and shootouts have a fresh malevolence to them."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,70,"With equal measures of rock-the-house vigor and in-your-face attitude, Four Brothers proves usually potent and consistently enjoyable as an old school approach to what might best be described as the urban-Western genre of slam-bang, balls-out action-revenger."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,70,"It's a finely tuned Motor City engine: The action, including a nighttime car chase through a blinding snowstorm, is fast, brutal and efficient; the Motown soundtrack never cuts out; and as a gangster called Sweet, the British-Nigerian actor Chiwetel Ejiofor gives an electrifying performance."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,70,"Wahlberg, whose Bobby is the kind of guy who enters a room gun first, swinging a can of a gasoline, is the glue that holds everything together; he's perfectly cast and has never given a more persuasive performance."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,70,"Gripping: Even when it wobbles off-track, it has some juice to it."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,63,Proficiently made trash.
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,63,"Easily the best 1975 B-movie made in 2005, Four Brothers is a raucously entertaining vigilante film."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,63,"True, John Ford and John Wayne did this stuff a lot better back in the day, but they're not around anymore. John Singleton is, and it's nice to see someone caring enough to keep the tradition alive."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,63,"A faux-low-budget revenge thriller, pure and simple. There's nothing special about it, and that's what's refreshing."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,63,"What holds us are the actors, including Terrence Howard as a cop who grew up with the brothers."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,60,"A typically energetic urban action melodrama, offering car chases, beatings, murders, a dog mauling, attempted arson, frequent double-crosses and pitched street battles worthy of Fallouja."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,60,It’s more than adequate as an old school action movie slightly updated for modern audiences.
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,60,"Heavy-handed in places and bad news for the Detroit Tourist Commission, this is still a slick, fun ensemble piece and a step back in the right direction for Singleton."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,58,"The casting is hit-and-miss. OutKast's Benjamin and ""Troy's"" Hedlund are weak, but Gibson is very appealing and the movie powers along on a strong lead performance by Wahlberg, who has never seemed more confident, commanding or scruffily charismatic."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,50,"If you take any of this seriously, you are not going to enjoy the movie very much. But as an absurd riff on baadasssss gangsta movies, Four Brothers has an undeniable visceral kick."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,50,"The movie's not great, but Mom might like it."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,50,"For all its well-drawn lines between good and evil, Four Brothers is ultimately passive entertainment."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,50,"Four Brothers immediately joins the Good Idea, Bad Execution club. Hardly anyone seems to care about its believability - not director John Singleton, writers David Elliott and Paul Lovett or some lackadaisical actors."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,50,"This is the kind of scrappy Seventies-throwback B-movie that fits the bill when you desperately need to see regular-seeming, occasionally inept people rise up against our corrupt criminal oppressors and cudgel them with pool cues and bits of blasted-off brick."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,50,"More action directors should include scenes such as the Mercers' extended Thanksgiving dinner, which fleshes out the bond between the brothers without using too many words."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,50,"What results is unremarkably schizophrenic--half gritty sojourn into the inner-city furnace, half Hollywood brain death."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,40,"Atmospheric, propulsive and ultimately preposterous melodrama."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,40,"Loud, stupid, unrealistic, overdone, without a thought in its ugly little head and kind of enjoyable."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,38,"Singleton's sloppiest, laziest movie to date, springing to life in fits and starts, risibly mawkish and occasionally gripping, and often feeling like it was made up on the set."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,38,The director's approach is far too ham-fisted and erratic to bring Four Brothers up to the level of enjoyable trash -- it's too crummy to earn that distinction.
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,25,"Because the script, riddled with verbal ugliness by David Elliot and Paul Lovett, sends the movie to a series of arbitrary nowheres, the final showdown for the Mercer boys and their enemies is just as meaningless and sense-deadening."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,20,"Four Brothers regresses into gallows comedy, rampant misogyny, and one preposterous Hollywood action setpiece after another."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,20,"A career low for Mark Wahlberg and director John Singleton (Boyz N the Hood), this ridiculous mean-streets adventure starts out like a Hell's Kitchen melodrama from the 30s and eventually spins off into a series of gunfights, beat downs, and trite Motown numbers."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,12,"Four Brothers? Ringling Brothers is more like it, because John Singleton's latest stinks like something the elephants left behind. It's not clear what the film is trying to do, but it seems safe to guess that it's doing it wrong."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,100,"White House Down aims to be a low-brow slab of mindless summer fun. Most of the time, it comes pretty close to hitting the bull’s eye."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,80,"White House Down is still too gun-happy, and too long, but however you feel about the Oval Office, our country, or some of the movie's jingoism, young Emily is worth rescuing."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,75,"Only in the last half-hour do the usual Emmerich absurdities pile up: I laughed outright at the character who, past 65 and diagnosed with a massive brain tumor that will kill him within months, cannot be stopped by a ferocious beating, being stabbed in the neck with a sharp implement, then being crushed against a wall by an SUV moving at a minimum of 30 mph."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,75,"While White House Down isn’t going to score points for originality, seriousness, or subtlety (Emmerich likes his political messages blunt and loud), it is a lot of fun; if nothing else, Emmerich is a great widescreen showman who knows how to stage mayhem on a grand scale."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,75,You couldn’t ask for a more fun summer popcorn movie than White House Down.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,75,"Of all the dumb megabudget ""Die Hard""–like action pictures of the last few years (including that other White House Goes Boom movie, ""Olympus Has Fallen""), this is both the most entertaining and the most inviting of viewers' input."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,70,What makes White House Down not just tolerable but frivolously entertaining is its slapstick soul; a scene where the presidential limousine does doughnuts on the South Lawn plays like an homage to the Keystone Kops.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,70,"White House Down is a hoot and a half, a shameless popcorn entertainment that is preposterous and diverting in just about equal measure."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,70,"An action thriller that doesn’t know when to quit. For the most part, though, it remains preposterously entertaining."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,70,"Itself owing much to such lone-man-of-action hallmarks as “Die Hard” and “Speed,” this welcome throwback to an earlier, more generously entertaining era of summer blockbusters delivers a wide array of close-quarters combat and large-scale destruction, all grounded in an immensely appealing star turn by Channing Tatum and ace support from imperiled POTUS Jamie Foxx."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,70,"White House Down is amply endowed with enough tension, humor, and calamitous action to ensure it a solid berth in the summer box-office sweepstakes. Channing Tatum comes into his own as a leading man in this picture, proving himself as a beefy yet agile action star and not just the pure beefcake of ""Magic Mike."""
White House Down,6.4,73103784,67,"Skip it, and you'll be depriving yourself of one of the summer's most satisfyingly stupid pleasures."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,67,"At best, White House Down is a sure-fire way to kill two hours, if not countless brain cells."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,65,"A buddy comedy disguised as a political thriller. It’s full of malarkey, but as a campaign of shock and awe, it’s hard to resist."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,63,"Intentionally or not, Roland Emmerich’s White House Down is the comedy hit of the summer. No other film equals its comic sophistication. Each nutty scenario is surpassed by the next, ludicrous story lines coalesce with expert orchestration, and absurd details return with perfect timing to build to a crescendo of hilarity."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,63,"While director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) piles on outlandish scenarios, the chemistry of the lead actors mitigates the contrived setup and numbing explosions."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,63,This bona-fide big-budget Hollywood flop at least has the good grace to laugh at itself as it rolls out the dingbat-daft action-movie cliches.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"The outcome may be pre-ordained, but Emmerich’s knack for a witty pop-culture reference, a pulse-pounding gun battle or a sneaky political undercurrent (the film has drawn fire in the US for being leftie propaganda) hasn’t deserted him."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,Lincoln meets Sudden Death: a corny but raucous throwback to when Planet Hollywood was hip. Gary Busey popping out of a rose bush wouldn’t feel out of place.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"Longer than OHF and just as daft, WHD makes for a more entertaining watch before succumbing to the same bombastic overkill."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"Even as the story accrues preposterousness, the action moves along crisply, and Tatum and Foxx hit a nice buddy-movie vibe."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"This is solidly a genre picture, and one that follows all the necessary conventions -- but it's also one that does it all very well. That means lots of big, dumb and loud action -- but it also means good, popcorny, summer fun."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"This piece of midsummer madness is undeniably silly and delusional, a dire political fable told as tongue-in-cheek pastiche."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"As demented and entertaining as promised, and a little less idiotic than feared."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"Often, the hilarity is indisputably intentional. If you think you'll laugh and clap, try it; if you know you'll hate it, you're right."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"Tatum muscles his way through the role with panache, while Foxx never gets a chance to break loose."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,58,"White House Down is nearly enough fun to be a bad movie that's a good time. But it always finds some way of being a drag, belching exposition and weak humor when action's all we need, then carrying the action to exhausting lengths."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,58,"White House Down is never more than a sliver away from gleeful self-parody. It’s pure patriotic kitsch, the cinematic equivalent of a black-velvet painting of a bald eagle clutching an American flag in its talons as it soars majestically over Mount Rushmore."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,"The main flaw of White House Down is that it overstays its welcome, thanks in large part to a silly climax that seems to unfold in three laborious acts. At least, Tatum keeps his shirt off."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,It's probably not a good idea to examine the political content of a film in which the leader of the free world proves that the pen is mightier than the sword by stabbing someone in the neck with one.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,"This sloppy mess also pales in comparison to the better-paced, taut ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" which represents 2013's better White House invasion story."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,Formula action films don’t come much more formulaic that this.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,This is getting old.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,"White House Down is a corker, real competition for “Fast & Furious 6″ as the dumbest fun you’ll have at the movies this summer."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,"Perhaps afraid that watching a symbol of liberty repeatedly go boom isn’t enough, Emmerich and screenwriter James Vanderbilt add family drama, an attack on Congress, a plane crash and the possible nuking of the Middle East. What isn’t tonally jarring ends up shatteringly inept."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,40,"White House Down never quite seems to decide what kind of movie it wants to be, although by firepower alone it qualifies as this summer’s most cartoonishly bombastic exercise in sensory overload (so far)."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,37,"The poster for this movie should read: Hello, Suckers!"
White House Down,6.4,73103784,30,"White House Down wants to riff on the stirring action crowd-pleasers of old. But instead of playing on those motifs, White House Down becomes a slave to them, turning into the very kind of rote, brainless, poorly choreographed and leaden action movie it wants to lighten up."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,25,"Roland Emmerich makes love of country into a thing of unabashed hokum, which bleeds through every nook of this overstuffed jumble and leaves no character untouched."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,25,"What played as rousingly dumb fun in ""Independence Day"" (1996) — all those pie-eyed nationalistic monologues, and U.S. landmarks reduced to rubble — now come off as callously insensitive, even with tongue firmly in cheek."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,25,"[A] cartoonish, offensive, overblown, clanging, steaming piece of ... cinema."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,80,"The achievement of John Carter is that it takes the elements worn to nubs by everything from ""Star Wars"" to ""Avatar"" to TV's ""Fringe"" and makes them fresh again."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,78,"Old-school ""Gosh, wow!"" sense-of-wonder filmmaking is in short supply in these anxious days, and John Carter (of Mars!) left me with my disbelief in suspended animation and once or twice with goosebumps dotting my arms. And that's enough for me."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,75,Did anybody expect it to be a metaphor for modern America?
John Carter,6.6,73078100,75,The result is an entertaining diversion but it lacks the magnificence one desires in the opening chapter of a would-be franchise.
John Carter,6.6,73078100,75,John Carter is too wickedly strange not to recommend. Movies this expensive usually play it much safer.
John Carter,6.6,73078100,75,"Against the odds, John Carter is itself pretty amazing - an epic pulp saga that slowly rises to the level of its best imitations and wins you over by degrees."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,75,"Spirit counts for something too, and John Carter has plenty of that, in addition to the requisite dashes of wit."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,75,"John Carter manages to be a ridiculous amount of fun, even if you are immune to the charms of Taylor Kitsch (Friday Night Lights) running around in what amounts to a stylish loincloth."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,75,"Rather than trying to overwhelm viewers by overloading the senses, John Carter's effects strive to create something new using as their foundation a book that's fired imaginations for the past century."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,70,"This middle section, in which both Carter and the audience get a crash course in the politics, history, and theology of the Red Planet, is the movie at its most imaginative and most fun."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,70,"If you're willing to suspend not just disbelief but also all considerations of logic and intelligence and narrative coherence, it's also a rip-roaring, fun adventure, fatefully balanced between high camp and boyish seriousness at almost every second."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,70,Director Andrew Stanton's Disney extravaganza is a rather charming pastiche.
John Carter,6.6,73078100,65,"It’s tempting to believe a great sci-fi yarn exists in Carter, somewhere in the no doubt thick sheaf of studio notes demanding more spoon-feeding of an audience they believe to be equally thick. But more likely, it’s possible that Stanton simply wasn’t ready to make the leap from animation to super-budgeted live action."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,63,"That's kind of the aesthetic that Stanton is going for: over-the-top pulp. But there's something generic about the digitally rendered Martians, and there's a corniness to the dialogue that keeps the audience from any kind of emotional attachment to the Tharks and Zodangans and their ilk."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,63,"John Carter bites off more than even Woola can chew, but it's built on something rare: wonder instead of Hollywood cynicism."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,63,"Does John Carter get the job done for the weekend action audience? Yes, I suppose it does. The massive city on legs that stomps across the landscape is well-done. The Tharks are ingenious, although I'm not sure why they need tusks. Lynn Collins makes a terrific heroine."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,60,"Get your ass to Mars? A handsome new sci-fi adventure that feels rather familiar. Enjoyable enough while it lasts, John Carter is big on ambition and disappointingly short on action."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,60,"There's no wonder or elation or even dopy sincerity here - just a high level of proficiency and, yes, a lot of expensive CGI."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,60,There are plenty of entertaining moments to latch onto beneath the sci-fi tropes -- and maybe even a few that will inspire a new generation of storytellers.
John Carter,6.6,73078100,60,"It is a potpourri of arcane and familiar genres. ""Mash-up"" doesn't begin to capture this hectic hybrid; it's more like a paintball fight. Messy and chaotic, in other words, but also colorful and kind of fun."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,60,"What director Andrew Stanton has brought forth from Burroughs' limited, hoary source material is actually kind of fun."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,60,"Stanton has built a fantastic world, but the action is unmemorable. Still, just about every sci-fi/fantasy/superhero adventure you ever loved is in here somewhere."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,58,So why is everything so thuddingly fun-free?
John Carter,6.6,73078100,55,"When Stanton lets the film be pure popcorn entertainment, with swashbuckling set pieces and lovably corny romanticism, it's a great ride in the Indiana Jones tradition."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,50,"Epically fantastic would be a welcome change, although epically awful would at least keep the symmetry. Alas, epically bland will have to do."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,50,"Though the project, based on the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel ""A Princess of Mars,"" is ambitious, it's also bloated, dreary and humorless."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,50,"Unlike Stanton's memorable animation features, this is surprisingly devoid of humor or winning characterization, though the special effects are fantastic."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,50,"The result is that John Carter plays like an alternate, inferior version of ""Avatar""…Plus fleeting hints of John Ford's ""The Searchers"" - for this is also a Western."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,50,"John Carter isn't much - or rather, it's too much and not enough in weird, clumpy combinations - but it is a curious sort of blur."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,50,"It's all too much, and it's too hard to follow. Less is more, and this movie proves it."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,50,"The film's biggest (and saddest) crime is malaise - it's not that John Carter doesn't care about what it's doing, it just can't make us care, even though the magnitude of every event, conflict and emotion is as melodramatic as its Victorian roots."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,40,"This new Disney film, marked by myriad lapses and marketing follies, bears the woefully familiar earmarks of a big studio production that was pulled and hauled every which way until it lost all shape and flavor."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,40,"That John Carter is so hit and miss, and miss, and miss is unfortunate on any number of levels."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,40,"Aside from a few inspired vistas and alien life-forms (the Road Runner–fast red planet dog Woola is sure to sell a bazillion action figures), John Carter is as deadly dull as its basso-voiced, beefcake slab of a star, Taylor Kitsch."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,40,"Stanton has been given the resources to create an expansive, expensive world, but lacks the instincts to direct live-action, a limitation that shows most in the performances. Bare of chest and fair of feature, Kitsch doesn't exhibit enough charisma to carry a project of this scale."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,40,"Interminably long, dull and incomprehensible, John Carter evokes pretty much every sci-fi classic from the past 50 years without having any real personality of its own."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,25,Even Strong's best efforts can't save John Carter from collapsing in on itself like a dead star.
John Carter,6.6,73078100,25,"The opening to John Carter is a dud, a battle between airships made of woven bamboo, bursting into computer-generated flame over a sandy terrain. There's nothing to see, nothing to think about, nothing to care about, and nothing to feel, just emptiness. The emptiness is never filled over the course of 132 long, barren minutes."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,25,"Nothing in John Carter really works, since everything in the movie has been done so many times before, and so much better."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,25,"Dejah, with her seen-it-all-before smirk, is not a very sympathetic heroine, and Kitsch is stolid and dull. And as for the red planet, the answer to David Bowie's famous question is no. What a sadd'ning bore it is."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,20,Most annoying is John Carter's scarcity of action. This much buck should buy more bang.
John Carter,6.6,73078100,16,"As film theorist Siegfried Kracauer once wrote, to paraphrase, art often blooms in the most hostile soil. No such luck here."
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,100,"Comedy, like most everything else, is subjective, and this may be the greatest example out there of ""getting it"" or not. If you thought the first movie, the original TV show, the Three Stooges, or ""Football in the Groin,"" was funny, chances are “ackass: Number Two is right up your alley."
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,90,"It didn't seem possible, but Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Wee Man and company might just have cooked up a sequel that's even wilder, funnier, extra-depraved and more gag-inducing than the seemingly incomparable ""Jackass the Movie."""
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,90,"Debased, infantile and reckless in the extreme, this compendium of body bravado and malfunction makes for some of the most fearless, liberated and cathartic comedy in modern movies."
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,80,"As merry pranksters they have no match, and as they age (Knoxville is 35 now), they only grow in appeal. As they proudly hurl their tattooed (by ink and battle scars) bodies into harm's way, a devilish glint in their eyes, it's as if they've discovered the fountain of youth, and its name is Jackass."
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,80,"Jackass: Number Two aims low and hits lower, but is as hilarious and uncomfortable an encounter as possible"
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,78,Just the kind of vicarious excitement for which the movies were invented.
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,75,"Jackass Number Two is not as original, aberrantly beautiful, unrepetitious, or good as Jackass Number One, yet it will still double a lot of people over with big laughs and grossed-out disbelief."
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,75,Some movies simply shouldn't be seen sober or alone.
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,75,"This is extreme comedy, and it's amazing how director Jeff Tremaine, who along with Spike Jonze has been affiliated with this troupe from its outset, creates an environment where self-inflicted torture is uncontrollably funny without being morally offensive."
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,75,"This is the ""Godfather II"" of tasteless prank films."
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,75,The heart of Jackass - the adolescent drive to bash body and soul into the symbolic brick wall of maturity - remains pure.
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,70,"The performers understand the simple integrity of a slapstick gag, and they're prepared to suffer for its entertainment value. This is what the Jackassers do for fun -- and their fans, already well versed in such previous shows as the original MTV series and the 2002 ""Jackass: The Movie,"" understand that perfectly. And is there any significant moral difference between these performers and dedicated ballerinas who damage their feet in the highfalutin interests of art, or Daytona drivers risking their lives on the track?"
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,70,"Parts of this are screamingly funny, other parts downright stomach turning, but you have to admire the fact that, for these guys, ""anything for a laugh"" really means anything. And for all the moronic behavior, there are also some inspired dadaist moments."
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,70,"Part of what makes ""ackass Number Two so frighteningly watchable -- even against your better judgment -- is the way the guys delight in one another's bumps, bangs and bruisings: First, they feel one another's pain; then they laugh like hell."
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,63,"Ask yourself this: Did the title make you laugh? If so, you're probably the target audience."
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,63,"Unapologetically appalling, more disgusting than anything you've ever seen and moronic enough to make you wonder about that theory on the depletion of the gene pool. It is also so funny it will make you choke."
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,63,"The sequel is a dizzying succession of pranks, Candid Camera-like sketches, and, that old crowd-pleaser, the boys actively courting their own grievous harm. This is what you get when a generation grows up watching far too many ""Roadrunner"" cartoons while sitting on the couch eating bowl after bowl of Lucky Charms."
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,50,"There's a certain morbid fascination, and perverse humor, in watching grown men enthusiastically turn themselves into human cartoons. (For better or worse, these guys are their generation's Stooges.)"
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,50,A buffet of dumb and degrading stunts halfway between Looney Tunes and Abu Ghraib?
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,50,"There are moments, heaven forgive me, that left me chuckling. Not to mention eternally grateful that it's these guys doing this stuff, and not me."
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,40,"This stunningly shameless follow-up to the 2002 theatrical sleeper (and homdevid mega-seller) offers more of the same -- a lot more -- while repeatedly upping the ante in terms of offensiveness. Which, of course, should greatly -- and profitably -- please is target aud."
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,25,"There is a point, however, at which the movie becomes simply sickening. Between the electric shocks and hot-iron branding, feats of grossness are accomplished that are so vile even the hardiest among the cast cannot suppress the upchuck."
Jackass Number Two,7.1,72778712,12,"There's no plot here; like the MTV show that spawned it, this movie is just a progression of increasingly disgusting and/or dangerous stunts."
Hercules,6,72688614,70,"Johnson is genuinely talented. He's often the best thing in bad movies, and Ratner's Hercules is, at the very least, pretty good."
Hercules,6,72688614,70,"The mythically powerful demigod is back on the big screen in the simply titled Hercules and the results are canny, fast-paced, and, for what the film attempts to accomplish, enjoyable."
Hercules,6,72688614,70,"It may sound like a backhanded compliment to praise this sometimes cheesy movie for never taking itself too seriously, but in a summer of bloated spectacles, this modesty should not be underestimated."
Hercules,6,72688614,70,"It’s a grandly staged, solidly entertaining, old-fashioned adventure movie that does something no other Hercules movie has quite done before: it cuts the mythical son of Zeus down to human size (or as human as you can get while still being played by Dwayne Johnson)."
Hercules,6,72688614,67,"If anything gets lost in the mayhem, it’s Johnson’s reliably charming personality."
Hercules,6,72688614,67,"Unsurprisingly, Johnson makes for a perfect movie-star Hercules, and the film gets a lot of mileage by playing his charismatic-but-modest take on the character off of the strong, predominantly British cast."
Hercules,6,72688614,60,There's a welcome lack of pretension to the proceedings. Stalwarts like Hurt and Ian McShane are on hand to class up the joint — everyone's got a British accent except for Johnson — while the predictable story bludgeons its way towards an inevitable conclusion.
Hercules,6,72688614,60,"Brett Ratner remains a director of no great distinction, but here, he proves himself an adept orchestrator of battle scenes, clearly presenting the forces on both sides, and using clear, coherent editing and dynamic compositions."
Hercules,6,72688614,60,Hercules has no right to be as entertaining as it is.
Hercules,6,72688614,60,"Fast-paced, funny, and packed with – to indulge in a bit of ad-speak — eye-popping action."
Hercules,6,72688614,60,"Sure, the film is crude, calorific and full of groanworthy half-jokes, but it holds together. It stacks up as an oafish pleasure for an undemanding summer – a rewriting of myths in scrawled crayon, with a nonchalant quality that makes its judiciously brief running time fly by."
Hercules,6,72688614,60,"With Hercules, Brett Ratner and Dwayne Johnson are out to entertain you — no more, no less. And that is just what they do."
Hercules,6,72688614,60,"There are some rousing battle scenes, preceded by stirring addresses on the subject of going to Elysium – all cheekily borrowed from Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator."""
Hercules,6,72688614,60,"By the beard of Zeus! Brett Ratner delivers fast, fun thrills to score a sound victory over Renny Harlin’s laborious The Legend Of Hercules."
Hercules,6,72688614,50,"Director Brett Ratner has always been associated with spectacle but, even for him, this represents a misstep because the ""wow!"" factor is muted."
Hercules,6,72688614,50,"As the plot clogs up with foreseeable reversals, wisecrack duties go to Mr. McShane, whose oracular character keeps wrongly predicting his own death. Like Hercules, the movie is plagued by a split identity: It’s half-slog, half-Mel Brooks."
Hercules,6,72688614,42,"When Johnson is wearing the head of the slayed Nemean lion in battle, walloping enemies with his tree-trunk sized club, and heaving charging horses to the ground with remarkable ease, he's in his Rock comfort zone. But as a tortured hero hampered by self-doubt, Johnson labors."
Hercules,6,72688614,40,"Strap on your swordbelt, buckle your sandals and oil up your rippling six-pack, because here comes yet another interminable, CGI-drenched mythic mish-mash with far more money than brain cells."
Hercules,6,72688614,38,"Director Brett Ratner could boast solid source material in the five-issue Radical Comics series Hercules: The Thracian Wars by the late Steve Moore. They had a shot at something here, and they blew it."
Hercules,6,72688614,38,"For all the fun these folks could have had with Hercules maintaining the supernatural assistance facade, or denying it as his handlers gild his lily testifying that it’s true, the movie is content to just go through the motions."
Hercules,6,72688614,37,"This outing does not suffer the epic badness one associates with films that aren’t screened early for critics, and in fact it offers moments of actual entertainment. It simply fails to exploit its assets: an amusing, revisionist take on the mythological strongman, and the charisma of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson."
Hercules,6,72688614,33,"It's mythmaking for dummies, a Hercules with no poetry, only incompetent brute strength."
Hercules,6,72688614,25,"Watching Hercules, you can feel your intelligence being insulted in almost every frame."
Hercules,6,72688614,20,"It's a supernatural epic that never feels quite colossal or consequential enough, as well as an utter waste of Dwayne Johnson‘s unique dopey-flirty charm."
Hercules,6,72688614,12,"The film fluctuates haphazardly between semi-serious reverence and tongue-in-cheek camp, with no shortage of opportunities for the inevitable Rifftrax accompaniment."
The Cannonball Run,6.2,72179579,60,"The highway is alive with the sound of a loud musical score, spectacular car crashes, pursuits, sudden breakdowns and jokes, practical and impractical. Some of it is ingenious, and all of it is breathless...The Cannonball Run is inoffensive and sometimes funny. Because there are only a limited number of variations that can be worked out on this same old highway race, don't bother to see it unless you're already hooked on the genre."
The Cannonball Run,6.2,72179579,60,"What saves the movie is its relaxed sense of self-awareness. Reynolds all but winks at the audience with his collection of Dick Dastardly sneaks and dodges, but holds onto that winning, hangdog warmth that got him to the top of the pile in the seventies."
The Cannonball Run,6.2,72179579,40,Cross-country race of the title comes off as almost entirely incidental to the star turns. Overall effect is akin to watching the troupe take a vacation.
The Cannonball Run,6.2,72179579,40,"Looks like something knocked off on rest days from Smokey and the Bandit II. The last five minutes, when they show out-takes of flubbed lines, etc, are hysterical. The rest is strictly for those willing to pay for a series of TV chat show performances."
The Cannonball Run,6.2,72179579,38,"With a plot stolen from THE GUMBALL RALLY (1976) and CANNONBALL (1976), this wholly derivative car-chase movie provides a flimsy excuse for good ol' boy Burt Reynolds to cavort on-screen with a cast that's chock-full of familiar faces."
The Cannonball Run,6.2,72179579,30,"The Cannonball Run is an abdication of artistic responsibility at the lowest possible level of ambition. In other words, they didn't even care enough to make a good lousy movie."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,80,It's also breathtaking to watch a throwaway studio sequel break its corporate chains before your very eyes and become something thrilling and dangerous and alive.
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,78,"The story has a welcome sense of continuous momentum, and what’s more, DeMonaco has a better handle on both his skewering of the entitled upper class (not as pointed as Paul Verhoeven’s ultraviolent satire, but a start) and the righteous anger of the targeted lower class (personified by Michael K. Williams’ resistance leader, Carmelo)."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,75,"The Purge: Anarchy expands on its predecessor, but the excellent news is that the sequel isn’t just bigger and badder and bleaker; it’s also better, smarter, stranger and tougher."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,75,The movie's potential blossoms whenever it toys with the allegorical ingredients head-on. DeMonaco's script plays like a devious Brothers Grimm tale told through the filter of Occupy Wall Street.
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,70,It's better than the first.
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,70,"Kill or be killed isn’t the official tag line of The Purge: Anarchy, but it fits. It would also make a more suitable title for this satisfyingly creepy, blunt, down-and-dirty thriller, one of those follow-ups that improves on the original."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,70,The Purge: Anarchy efficiently exploits its high-concept premise while delivering far more visceral thrills than its predecessor.
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,67,"Retains the original’s premise and politics, but actually puts them to use."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,63,"Isn't a cheap knock-off but an equally effective, deliciously disturbing movie. It's bound to delight genre fans (and dismay critics, who attacked the first as heavy-handed and sloppy)."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,63,"The result is an action-oriented survival tale, not unlike the kind of movie that Stallone or Schwarzenegger might have made back in the '80s."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,63,The film is at its best when it focuses on the more specific conflicts of five people thrown together on Purge night.
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,63,"Like the first movie The Purge: Anarchy, is trash masking as social commentary, and its depiction of unrelenting, sanctioned violence can be hard to stomach."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,63,"DeMonaco may doubly, sometimes triply, underline the story's governing theme of social power and how it's exchanged, but the rage and lucidity of these ideas resonate."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,60,"The franchise is a low-risk work-in-progress, but DeMonaco is improving as a shotmaker."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,50,"Ultimately, “Anarchy” is too cartoonish in its politics to gain the allegorical resonance it clearly strives for — and worse yet, it's just no fun."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,50,"So weak on a basic storytelling level that it makes you want to nitpick everything about it, from characters' generically illogical decisions (ex: Why are you running towards mounted guns?) to its cheap-looking, jiggly hand-held cinematography."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,50,"In The Purge: Anarchy, unfortunately, grim and brutal is pretty much all we get."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,50,"The Purge: Anarchy is a good deal bloodier, but also — gulp — a good deal better than its predecessor. Make no mistake, a good ""Purge"" does not equal a good movie, but the post-apocalyptic thriller is slightly more interesting because it takes itself, and its menace, more seriously."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,50,"The Purge: Anarchy improves upon the original, but it's still a long way from being the sort of smart, savage satire it would have to be to fully exploit such a socially charged hook."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,50,"Give credit to writer-director James DeMonaco for at least attempting to give his action thriller some heft with a plot that concerns our obsession with violence, ham-fisted as it is. But The Purge: Anarchy is still just an excuse to bombard us with high-powered weaponry, armored vehicles, vigilantes, and masked marauders in creepy Joker-like makeup."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,50,"It needs to be emphasized again for the record that The Purge: Anarchy is a tremendously stupid film... But there’s an almost-camp quality to how DeMonaco takes this stupidity to greater heights, building a complex mythology around the plot like a giant moat around a pillow fort."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,50,"When the situation is played totally straight, as it is for eighty percent of the running time, the message is boring: We'd all commit murder, theft and anarchy if only we could. With a narrative as depressively simplistic as that, we do find ourselves identifying with the characters in the movie—counting the minutes until the Purge is over."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,42,"Mainly, though, this is a humorless film that skimps on the delicious opportunity for spousal retribution."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,40,"You'd expect the sequel to be an improvement based on production values alone, and you would be right, but not by much."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,40,"For all the philosophical and metaphorical shortcomings of his script, however, DeMonaco is an efficient orchestrator of action."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,40,"Soulless and idiotic and abysmally scripted as it is, Anarchy, like its predecessor, feels mournfully relevant."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,38,"It’s preachier, more diverse in its casting. All of which make it more specific and limit it. Throw in generally lackluster performances and illogical plot twists and “Anarchy” is seriously crippled."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,38,This one veers further from actual horror into an action picture. “The Purge” tries to unsettle. The Purge: Anarchy wants you to cheer.
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,33,"The film defies one of the fundamental rules of capitalism: Exploitation of the proletariat may be well and good, but don’t execute them all. At the same time, “The Purge: Anarchy” obeys a cardinal law of Hollywood: Shoot first and ask questions later."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,25,"I’ve read ingredients labels that were scarier than The Purge: Anarchy, a plodding horror flick that mistakenly thinks it has big ideas."
The Purge: Anarchy,6.5,71962800,25,"The film’s “What if?” scenario takes the germ of an interesting social-science idea and lets it rot in a nasty, ethically questionable cesspool of junk cinema."
Stargate,7.1,71565669,70,Stargate is a clever adventure that should find its audience.
Stargate,7.1,71565669,70,"Stargate is peppered with numerous minor faults, some of which - although not all - are easily forgiven. It's the bigger plot problems and lackluster climax which are more difficult to excuse."
Stargate,7.1,71565669,63,"Roland Emmerich hasn't bettered us as a culture with Stargate, but he hasn't corrupted us, either."
Stargate,7.1,71565669,63,"By the end, the film’s early promise has pretty much degenerated into routine pyrotechnics."
Stargate,7.1,71565669,50,"The film has flashes of psychedelic visual energy, but its story is limp."
Stargate,7.1,71565669,50,"Without Davidson Stargate might seem clunky and routine, but he gives it a weirdo charge. It may be a lousy movie, but it's a more enjoyably lousy movie than most."
Stargate,7.1,71565669,50,"The arrival of Ra (Jaye Davidson), bearing sci-fi cliches, changes Stargate from a merely hokey movie to one that is truly ridiculous."
Stargate,7.1,71565669,50,"The special effects turn out to be not very special and not very effective, and the movie never achieves the lunatic grandeur of the truly demented. Stargate is strictly for the peanut gallery."

The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,88,A well-crafted family thriller that is truly scary and doesn't wimp out.
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,75,"Not great fantasy, but it's on more solid ground than ""The Golden Compass"" and will seem less baffling to some. There's enough here to keep adults engaged, which is an important component of any motion picture that wants to be known as ""family entertainment."""
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,75,A fast-moving adventure with more than dynamic glitz to recommend it.

The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,75,"The film underscores the power of reading, and applying what we read to problem-solving. The story suggests that we don't really see the natural world around us, and if we did our lives, like Jared's and his siblings', would be immeasurably richer."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,75,"The movie is funny and scary and touching in all the ways the best children's pictures are, but it is also fast and compact, running a perfectly paced 93 minutes (including credits)."

The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,70,"A work of both modest enchantment and enchanting modesty, grounded in a classically Spielbergian realm where childlike wonderment crosses paths with the tough realities of young adulthood."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,70,"The movie's richly autumnal look is by swift turns cozily naturalistic and terrifyingly baroque, and director Mark Waters (Freaky Friday, Mean Girls) sustains the balance between real and surreal with mischievous brio."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,70,Suffers slightly from that not-so-fresh feeling.
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,70,"Meticulously rendered CGI creatures--from Arthur Rackham-esque flower sprites to a troll that could have sprung from ""Jurassic Park""--spike this dark adventure, shot marvelously by Caleb Deschanel."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,70,"The children's real world, or what passes for real in a fantasy, could hardly be more inviting, for reasons that are hardly mysterious: the strong performances, under Mark Waters's accomplished direction; the smart, bright language, much of it taken from the books; the stylish cinematography, by Caleb Deschanel."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,70,"A decent entertainment -- not up there with the ""Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings"" sagas, but a notch above ""The Golden Compass"" and ""Narnia."""

The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,67,"Starts off promisingly by empathetically depicting the fear and anger children feel when their parents separate, but ultimately its human emotions are dominated by goblins, trolls, and other CGI-generated creatures running amok on the screen."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,63,"Unlike Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" which was also inspired by Rackham, The Spiderwick Chronicles is more whimsical than scary."

The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,50,"The obvious product of a corporate search for the next great fantasy franchise, this adaptation of the first in a series of popular children's books by the writer-illustrator team of Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi is a lump of leaden whimsy."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,50,"Overrun with malicious goblins, a vengeance-minded pig, a fast-moving troll and a giant horned ogre, but the true source of terror is scarier than all of these combined: New York real estate prices."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,50,"For the uninitiated? Man, it's a bummer."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,40,"Instead of the kind of inspired imaginative synergy that distinguished the “Lord of the Rings” and later “Harry Potter” pictures, this movie, directed by Mark Waters (“Mean Girls”), feels more like a sloppy, secondhand pander."
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,71038190,42,"If anything, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 ups that sadness quotient, spending much of its opening proving that just because these movies are stupider than ""Observe And Report"" doesn’t mean they have to be less cripplingly depressing."
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,71038190,40,"It’s not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he’s barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels. As you watch the film, it’s already forgotten."
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,71038190,30,"To his credit, director Andy Fickman (“The Game Plan,” “Parental Guidance”) keeps the inanity moving apace and there are a few chuckles to be had courtesy of the supporting cast. But, as is so often the case with big, star-driven studio laffers, “Cop 2” needed several more spins in the comedy punch-up machine before cameras rolled."
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,71038190,25,Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 does all it was created to do: exist.
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,71038190,25,"Is it never funny? No, it’s not never funny. It’s just not funny nearly often enough."
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,71038190,25,"Sequels are cynical by nature, but this one, with its casino product placement ad and director Andy Fickman apparently checking his text messages instead of trying to punch the limp gags into shape, is purely a paycheck. James may not deserve better, but the kids they’re pitching this to do."
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,71038190,20,"In the past, James at least had likability on his side. He was a big, lumbering oaf, the ideal drinking buddy. But there’s an arrogance to the way he treats people here, particularly a gorgeous hotel employee he’s convinced is in love with him, that renders him strangely unsympathetic."
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,71038190,20,"You won’t find much offensive in Kevin James’s slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won’t find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations. If Mr. James’s character thinks of safety first, so does this movie, to its extreme detriment."
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,71038190,20,"Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?"
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,71038190,20,"Nothing aired by WikiLeaks could possibly be more destructive to Sony’s reputation than the release of Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, the sort of movie that goes beyond mere mediocrity to offer possible evidence of a civilization in decline."
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,71038190,20,"While the original was no classic, it had a few mild laughs and the plus-sized actor displayed a certain buffoonish charm. Such is not the case with this painfully unfunny, slapdash follow-up in which the title character is so relentlessly obnoxious that you'll be cheering for the villains."
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,71038190,20,"Given that it comes courtesy of Adam Sandler’s production company Happy Madison... it’s no surprise that Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a lazy, witless, laugh-free experience. But even by their standards, this is a slog to sit through, so glacially paced that at times it achieves an almost zen-like level of anti-comedy."
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,71038190,6,"The humor level in the film is so moribund that it doesn’t even inspire groans or eye-rolling; instead, it figuratively puts its hands on your shoulders and pushes you deeper into your theater seat until you’ve been completely subdued by all the nothingness it has to offer."
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,71038190,0,What’s most dispiriting about this garbage burger is its nonsensical characterization of Blart himself.
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,71038190,0,"James' everyman appeal is stretched to the limits here, like that polyester shirt he wears."
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,4.4,71038190,0,"Think of the worst movie you’ve ever seen – a movie that didn’t make you laugh, didn’t make you cry, didn’t move you or change you in any way besides giving you the desperate urge to flee the theater. Think of a movie that was a massive waste of your time and money. Hold that title in your mind. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is worse than that."
Bird on a Wire,5.9,70980000,63,"In Bird on a Wire, director John Badham doesn't pay the dues before he brings in the exotic locations. We don't believe the characters, and so the elaborate chases and escapes and stunts and special effects are all affectations."
Bird on a Wire,5.9,70980000,63,Despite the extended running time jam packed with action scene after after scene it still feels a little short on content.
Bird on a Wire,5.9,70980000,60,"Screwball romance, action picture. Summer movie."
Bird on a Wire,5.9,70980000,50,"Bird on a Wire lords its star power over us; it thinks the sheer cumulative adorableness of the principals will win us over and make up for its multitude of sins. It should think again. There is nothing to this John Badham movie except the spectacle of determined stars turning the brilliance of their personalities on us. That and chases -- car chases, motorcycle chases, airplane and helicopter chases."
Bird on a Wire,5.9,70980000,50,"Within the first half-hour, we've met the baddies (led by a taciturn Carradine), heard Rick and Marianne's teasing banter, and experienced the thrills of a shootout and car chase. As for what follows, this drearily repetitious film offers more of the same with variations in backdrop, all directed in perfunctory fashion by Badham. It does have a nice '60s soundtrack; shame about the rest."
Bird on a Wire,5.9,70980000,50,Both frenetic and witless--a bad combination. It's the sort of action-comedy vehicle that stands a chance of succeeding only if the star chemistry is strong enough to compensate for all the uninspired calisthenic derring-do.
Bird on a Wire,5.9,70980000,50,"Big, dull, and noisy, this comedy-romance has chases galore, but its comedy is flat and its romance is grating and graceless."
Bird on a Wire,5.9,70980000,40,"Bird on a Wire is far from inept-every one of those car chases is masterfully staged. Still, for most of two hours you’re pummeled with formula; it would be hard to name another movie at once so proficient and so dull. When a director as talented as Badham reaches this state of empty craftsmanship, who can say whether he’s working out of boredom or cynicism? At this point, there may be very little difference."
Bird on a Wire,5.9,70980000,40,"Crass, shoddy and crudely exploitative of the public's worst instincts, John Badham's Bird on a Wire reflects just about everything that's wrong with American movies right now."
Broken Arrow,6,70770147,100,"Broken Arrow delivers the hippest action fun around. Travolta's ""Dr. Strangelove"" exit will blow you away. Ditto the movie."
Broken Arrow,6,70770147,88,"There are lapses in character motivation, and at times the film takes on a cartoony feeling. But if you worry about those things, you shouldn't be watching action movies. For its genre, Broken Arrow is a class act."
Broken Arrow,6,70770147,88,"Broken Arrow isn't the ultimate fusion of Hong Kong surrealism and Hollywood realism, but it points the way to nerve-shattering possibilities."
Broken Arrow,6,70770147,80,"Woo has turned out a slick piece of business, filled with explosions and assorted acts of violence brought off with considerable movie-making skill."
Broken Arrow,6,70770147,78,"A lively action picture with a spirited sense of humor, Broken Arrow is a great deal of fun, even if it isn't exactly a return to form for its celebrated director, former Hong Kong action auteur John Woo."
Broken Arrow,6,70770147,75,"Broken Arrow is ""Speed"" gone nuclear. Yet, despite all the explosions, violence, special effects, and other choreographed excesses, this film doesn't have quite the same impact. It's fun, to be sure, and the wild ride doesn't let up for a moment, but the level of tension isn't quite as high."
Broken Arrow,6,70770147,75,"The vestiges of Woo's achingly romantic style play badly in this can-do context, while the mayhem is never more -- and occasionally less -- than competent."
Broken Arrow,6,70770147,75,"Mr. Woo orchestrates his giddy, daring stunts on a newly spectacular level. There's plenty of physical audacity on screen."
Broken Arrow,6,70770147,70,"John Woo directed this giddy, mindless jaunt with polish but only a modicum of personal investment from a script by Graham Yost."
Broken Arrow,6,70770147,70,"The audience gets as pulverizing a workout as the stars do. Or rather, the stars' stunt doubles, who deserve Oscars for best supporting masochism."
Broken Arrow,6,70770147,70,"One fundamental problem with the movie is that John Travolta is seriously miscast as a nuclear terrorist. Say what you will about the guy, he doesn't come across as a heavy."
Broken Arrow,6,70770147,60,"With its lightweight hero and its random spray of ''high-powered'' action, Broken Arrow is like an underpopulated version of The A-Team. It's not just John Woo who gets swallowed up by the impersonal mechanics of big-budget mayhem. It's the audience, which pays for a sleek, dark thriller and gets recycled pulp instead."
Broken Arrow,6,70770147,50,"It's entertaining in a laughable, six-pack kind of way, acceptable if you're in the mood, slightly irritating if you're not."
Broken Arrow,6,70770147,50,Arrow is about as abysmal as abysmal gets.
Broken Arrow,6,70770147,50,"Broken Arrow, a deafening, brain-deadening action thriller, takes a mighty blase approach to nuking Denver."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,90,"It is one continuous fight sequence from opening scene to final credits, but lacks the blood, profanity, and gore that would have merited a more adult rating."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,75,"The movie's extensive martial arts sequences, in which combatants bounce off each other doing triple handsprings, suggest a slightly more earthbound version of the aerial ballets in Hong Kong action-adventure films."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,70,"But where others have sunk in the mire of imitation, director Paul Anderson and writer Kevin Droney effect a viable balance between exquisitely choreographed action and ironic visual and verbal counterpoint."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,70,"Expect lots of earsplitting music, garish visuals and badly staged martial arts action."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,63,"A mix of martial-arts and special-effects magic, the film serves its nonstop confrontations either straight up or with a twist (as when they involve Kombatants with special powers, like Sub-Zero, Reptile and Scorpion)."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,60,"The filmmakers try to solve the problem of turning an experience which merely consists of a series of fights into a story by... ignoring it, presenting a film which merely consists of a series of fights."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,60,"And although director Paul Anderson treats the story with appropriate deadpan respect, there are enough sparks of humor (particularly generated by Linden Ashby as a shallow martial-arts actor who worries that he's a fake, with good reason) to amuse the adults accompanying the 10-year-old boys in the audience."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,58,"It is, in essence, the video game transferred part and parcel to the screen, and very well at that."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,50,"Mortal Kombat the movie has everything a teenage boy could want: snakes that jut out of a villain's palms, acrobatic kung- fu fighting and a couple of battling babes. Everything, that is, but an interesting plot, decent dialogue and compelling acting"
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,50,But soon the movie falls flat under an uninspired good-versus-evil plot and pathetically simpleminded dialogue.
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,90,"Broccoli serves the audience a space-shuttle hijacking, a jumbo-jet explosion and a protracted wrestling match between two men who are falling from the sky without parachutes. All this happens before the opening credits. From there, it's on to gondola chases in Venice, funicular crashes in Rio and laser-gun shootouts and lovemaking in deep space. Meanwhile, beautiful women come and go, talking (ever so discreetly) about fellatio. When Broccoli lays out a feast, he makes sure that there is at least one course for every conceivable taste...The result is a film that is irresistibly entertaining as only truly mindless spectacle can be."
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,88,Moonraker begins with one of the funniest and most dangerous (as well as most beautifully photographed and edited) sequences Bond has ever faced.
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,80,"The visual effects, stuntwork and other technical contributions all work together expertly to make the most preposterous notions believable. And Roger Moore, though still compared to Sean Connery, clearly has adapted the James Bond character to himself and serves well as the wise-cracking, incredibly daring and irresistible hero."
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,80,"Moonraker is mercifully much better than recent Bondage, with fantastic special effects, some excellent buffery (cracks at Star Wars, Close Encounters, Clint Eastwood, to name but a few), and the usual location-hopping style that makes Versailles feel like Disneyland."
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,80,"Moonraker is a movie by gadgeteers, for gadgeteers, about gadgeteers. Our age may be losing its faith in technology, but James Bond sure hasn't."
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,75,"While parts of Moonraker are rather silly (a trend during Roger Moore's tenure), solid special effects, well-executed action sequences, and a strict reliance upon the ""Bond Formula"" keep this film among Moore's better entries as the British superspy."
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,75,"Moonraker, the newest James Bond spectacle, is a cheerful, splashy entertainment. The curators of the Bond museum do not surpass themselves with this exhibition, the 11th in the series, but they haven't fallen down on the job either. Moonraker is a satisfying blend of familiar ingredients, from the highly polished to the barely adequate. [29 June 1979, p.C1]"
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,70,More impressive than entertaining.
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,70,"The gadgets are up to the usual Bond standards, but fancy effects do not a movie make, and 007 is less satisfying floating around in space than when his feet are more or less firmly planted on the ground."
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,50,Bond meets Star Wars in one of the series' sillier outings.
Blade,7.1,70087718,80,"Big as it is, Blade' is meticulous and subtle, not just in its camera technique but in the way it works its themes and creates a mood."
Blade,7.1,70087718,75,"Wesley Snipes understands the material from the inside out and makes an effective Blade because he knows that the key ingredient in any interesting superhero is not omnipotence, but vulnerability."
Blade,7.1,70087718,75,"Blade in no way resembles a good movie, but its combination of music-video bombast, goth-rock sensibility, high-tech industrial production design, cold-blooded glossy magazine visuals, high-fashion club culture, horror movies, blaxploitation movies, Hong Kong movies and comic-book nihilism make it diverting trash."
Blade,7.1,70087718,70,"Sure, the story is pretty standard, and the dialogue is laughable or worse. But creative cinematography and non-stop, decently choreographed gratuitous violence make watching this comic-book movie—Blade is a minor, almost-forgotten Marvel comic—entertaining."
Blade,7.1,70087718,70,"""Interview With the Vampire"" it's not, but marginally thrilling nonetheless, and besides, any film that features a house party in which the ceiling-mounted fire extinguishers expel freshets of crimson goo in place of H2O gets my vote."
Blade,7.1,70087718,67,"By the time the film is well into its second hour, we begin to wonder whether there's ever going to be a variation on the carnage and mayhem. As it turns out, there isn't."
Blade,7.1,70087718,63,Blade doesn't manage to work up a whole lot of suspense.
Blade,7.1,70087718,63,"Blade's stomach-turning special effects, bone-crunching martial arts and cynical humor will more than satisfy any action-film addict's need for a fix of eye-popping escapist adrenaline."
Blade,7.1,70087718,60,"At best, second-rate pulp, hampered by excessive length, a thematically meandering screenplay, and a general lack of excitement."
Blade,7.1,70087718,50,Director Stephen Norrington is more keen on finding new ways to explode the fiends... than developing a credible story. So the movie flits from one gore-laden assault to another with little suspense.
Blade,7.1,70087718,50,"For most of its two-hour running time it simply flings a barrage of horrors at the audience, enhanced with the most imaginative science-fiction atmospherics this side of ""Dark City,"" which incidentally was a far more original picture."
Blade,7.1,70087718,50,The noir atmosphere doesn't quite smother the dialogue's cheesy smell.
Blade,7.1,70087718,50,"Although the opening scene suggests a dark urban satire, Blade quickly turns into a cartoonish futuristic action-adventure yarn in which Blade is the only thing keeping humanity from being exterminated by vampires in a hematological holocaust."
Blade,7.1,70087718,40,"Though slick and diverting in some aspects, increasingly silly pic has trouble meshing disparate elements --- horror, superhero fantasy, straight-up action --- into a workable whole."
Blade,7.1,70087718,40,If only it wasn't such bloody nonsense.
Blade,7.1,70087718,38,"Adapted from the Marvel Comics series, this movie lacks the mournfulness that sustains a good horror strip; it's trashy, but too deafening and invasive to have the appeal of good pulp."
Blade,7.1,70087718,38,A vulgar attempt to revamp the undead genre by introducing computer-generated splatter and a casketful of themes from genetic tinkering to conspiracy theories.
Blade,7.1,70087718,30,"The few good lines go to Kristofferson and the ever-amusing Kier, but Snipes's considerable energy is buried under an affectless, Terminator-style demeanor."
Blade,7.1,70087718,30,"The action involves lots of second-rate martial-arts choreography (made even less thrilling by the video's pan-and-scan job), while the psychological conflicts are filled with unconvincing angst."
Blade,7.1,70087718,30,"Working from a script by David S. Goyer (""Dark City"") that lacks any sense of humor or character, Snipes seems unsure if he should vamp it up or play it straight, while Dorff just plain sucks."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,75,"Peculiarly entertaining exercise in bare-bones, Hollywood-style action heroism."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,67,"When the bullets are flying, Act of Valor is undeniably tense and thrilling."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,67,"If all you care about is bang-bang, then Act of Valor should satisfy you.  But if all you care about is bang-bang, then you're invalidating the very reason the actual SEALS appear in this film:  to put a human face on their dangerous work."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,63,Employing Navy troops as stars is a clever idea for an action thriller. But the soldiers' awkward line readings are glaring enough to distract from the potency of the story.
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,63,"Act of Valor is a competently directed action movie, but forcing the audience to wear such narrow goggles is a dereliction of duty."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,63,"Act of Valor is gift-wrapped in patriotism. It was once intended as a recruitment film, and that's how it plays."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,63,"The best I can say is that I was never bored, although I was never overwhelmed, either. There are enough small things to keep it interesting even when many of the big things fail."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,60,"In the movie's best moment, an American sniper takes out a bad guy by a pier while a pair of hands reaches out of the water to grab the body so it doesn't make a splash and alert the other baddies."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,60,"Although the film has its undeniably immersive, convincing moments, the merging of dramatic re-creations and on-camera ""performances"" proves less seamlessly executed than those masterfully coordinated land, sea and air missions."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,60,It would benefit greatly from having real actors in the major roles. That the bad guys -- who are actors -- are more charismatic is certainly not due to the fact that we are on their side. It's because they know how to make us want to watch.
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,58,"The bad guys, who specialize in funny beards, funny accents, and shaved heads, would feel right at home in an ""Austin Powers"" movie."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,58,"Act of Valor will likely earn high praise from combat veterans and their families, the way movies like ""Fireproof"" and ""Seven Days in Utopia"" resonate with Christians. Civilians, movie critics and certainly pacifists won't be nearly as impressed."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,50,"The exercises are genuine, and so is the hardware. But the script undermines the sense of authenticity at every turn."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,50,"Refreshing as it is to see the military portrayed as something other than a band of neurotics and creeps, there's a reason this brand of rah-rah and bang-bang didn't outlast the age of Whitesnake and Marty McFly."

Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,50,"For what it is, it's well done, well filmed, well outfitted with ordnance and, well, exciting. However, in script, characters and plot, Act of Valor offers only the barest minimum."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,50,"This intriguing hybrid is dramatically involving only when the shooting - with real bullets, naturally - gets underway."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,50,"The action beats come straight out of the video game ""Call of Duty."" And when you have real SEALs placed in a picture that lives and dies on the same old first-person-shooter aesthetic, you have a film divided against itself."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,50,"The villains come across as individuals rather more compellingly than do the film's ostensible heroes, mostly mouthpieces for warrior credo recited in voiceover."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,40,"This voiceover is one of many perplexing elements in this ridiculously pumped-up military recruitment video, which intersperses brilliant and immersive combat scenes with excruciating comradely banter."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,40,"Despite the weak performances and the scattershot screenplay, the film is visually terrific."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,40,"Like all advertisements, this scripted movie is a perfect fantasy: expertly coordinated, simplistic (the bad guys like yachts and bikini girls while our heroes have loving families) and more than a little scary."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,40,"Shows remarkable access to military materials and personnel but, as a film, is unremarkable every other way."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,40,"A mechanically efficient yet soulless dramatization of the U.S. Navy SEALs in action, Act of Valor ultimately misses its target: The hearts and minds of American audiences."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,40,"This archipelago of maneuvers, however jaw-dropping, never coheres into a real movie."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,38,The problem is that these stoic warriors infect Act of Valor with more wooden acting than you'd see at a ventriloquism school.
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,35,"The plot might be summed up this way: America's having a war, and everybody's invited!"
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,30,"By our count, three of the core SEALs are maimed or dead by the end. A new baby is left without her loving father. The picture ends not with a parade but with a funeral. And that may be the toughest, most lasting image in this cockamamie, Pentagon-approved war adventure."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,25,I don't know what to make of Act of Valor. It's like reviewing a recruiting poster.
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,25,"It's thin material, to say the least, and manipulative to boot, putting women, children, and a SEAL father-to-be in jeopardy in ways more about servicing cheap thrills than any larger point about the perilous state of the world in 2012."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,20,The gimmick behind this excruciating propagandist movie about the US special forces' war on terror is that it features not actors but actual Navy Seals.
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,20,"Another reason to avoid films endorsed by the US military, this is sub-propaganda tosh that inadvertently plays like Hot Shots: Part Trois."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,20,"Act of Valor is like watching the wrestlers in dramas produced by the WWE: They're great at what they do, but being in front of the camera isn't part of that."
Act of Valor,6.5,70012847,0,"A movie whose cinematic ineptitude is matched only by its ideological rottenness, Act of Valor features a cast of real-life active-duty Navy SEALS in order to grant the project's us-versus-them geopolitical worldview a sham moral authority."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,88,A good movie? Hardly. But more than enough to pass a dog day afternoon.
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,75,"It's skillfully mounted and fitfully intriguing, but weaves such a tangled web that at the end I defy anyone in the audience to explain the exact loyalties and motives of the leading characters."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,63,"If you like stuff breaking in THX, Swordfish delivers like no other this year. Bring earplugs."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,63,"So fast, sleek and riveting it almost makes you expect miracles -- which never materialize."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,60,"The action is constant, often pointless, definitely gratuitous, and breathlessly fun."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,50,Ridiculous but occasionally fun.
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,50,"A half-absorbing, half-ridiculous techno-thriller that often goes too far in search of audience-rousing effects."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,50,"A slick, cynical, nasty piece of heist-film plotting that hides its more obvious logical gaps in techno-babble and distracting spectacles of wanton violence and big explosions."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,50,So much luck is pressed with an absurdly overblown finale that 60 seconds will likely be Swordfish's shelf life after a couple of noisy opening weekends.
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,50,Jinxed itself into being nothing but an inane popcorn flick pretending to be edgy.
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,50,"Swordfish is exactly the kind of nominally high-octane actioner that breeds legions of apologists who will encourage you to ""check your brain at the door"" before seeing it."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,50,By the third big climax the audience started to get impatient with the movie's pointless zigs and zags.
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,42,"Another in a long line of middling movies for Travolta, who must have been so stunned to regain his stardom with ""Pulp Fiction"" that he hasn't stopped working since."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,40,"Noisy and obnoxious, this flashy action picture is so hell-bent on seeming smart that it fairly forces you to think about how fundamentally stupid it is."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,40,"Feels like every other action thriller we've seen in the past three years, only it's more annoying -- and, in some cases, more appalling -- because it's trying so hard to distinguish itself."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,40,"Not all cartoon violence; there's cartoon nudity, too. Berry was paid a well-publicized $500,000 bonus to bare her breasts in the movie."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,40,"The story -- is just what fills in the gaps between slow-motion fireballs, Matrix-style frozen mayhem, and Halle Berry's notoriously undraped breasts."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,40,"This lurid thriller comes to life in fits and starts, and then sinks into the bog of its own cleverness once again."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,38,"It's a film that reeks of stupidity and cynicism, one that makes you feel soiled just to have sat through it."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,38,An action opera designed to elicit Beavis and Butt-head-level appreciation.
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,30,"Nobody really cares about the plot, least of all the filmmakers."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,25,Turns into a meticulously choreographed bang-by-the-numbers action fantasy that I would accuse of peddling evil if the film weren't so dumb and incoherent.
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,25,Exhibits rank incompetence on every level.
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,20,Nutty paranoid thriller.
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,20,"A kind of dirty fairy tale in which people with nasty attitudes inhabit a trash-talking, macho world of fast cars and complaisant women."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,20,"John, John, John -- one more bad-guy role in a bad movie and you're going to need another comeback."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,20,"About 45 minutes into Swordfish, the picture degenerates permanently from drivel to sleaze (only a short drop)."
Swordfish,6.5,69772969,20,"The cinema of morons made by morons for morons, Swordfish is everything you expect but worse."
Hot Shots!,6.7,69467617,88,Hot Shots! offers a satisfying kick in the pants to a movie (and an era) that has more than earned it.
Hot Shots!,6.7,69467617,83,"Charlie Sheen brings just the right exaggerated seriousness to his ace pilot's role, and Cary Elwes perfectly captures the ingenue arrogance of Topper's handsome rival. Jon Cryer, as a pilot with major eyesight problems, also displays expert deadpan timing, especially when he delivers the film's most uproarious line."
Hot Shots!,6.7,69467617,80,"Hot Shots! is very sharp and very funny, and if it doesn't have the aggressive, anarchic edge of ""Airplane!"" (attitude seems to be the specialty of David Zucker, who has just released ""The Naked Gun 2 1/2 ""), it is consistently, almost exhaustingly hilarious."
Hot Shots!,6.7,69467617,75,"Funny as it is for a great deal of its length, Hot Shots! does, however, have its share of dull spots, and watching it inevitably makes one yearn for the good old days of ""Airplane!"""
Hot Shots!,6.7,69467617,75,"While the slapstick comedy antics are frequently amusing and, on rare occasions, even hilarious, HOT SHOTS!, like so many other cinematic parodies before it, tends to lose sight--or control--of the plot, such as it is, in favor of more jokes, more visual gags and more dialogue puns--all hurled at the audience at a rapid-fire pace."
Hot Shots!,6.7,69467617,75,"The movie's nowhere near the inspired funniness of its predecessors. But it often displays the same spirit. It's strung end to end with sight gags. Some fall flat on their faces. But, by sheer weight of numbers, many of them work. It depends on your ability to lower yourself into -- or steer stoically clear of -- the idiocy pit."
Hot Shots!,6.7,69467617,75,"Unfortunately, the film begins to fall apart when it leaves film parody and strays too close to reality. This film is so timely, it has the young pilots flying a bombing run on Saddam Hussein's nuclear plant. Either these filmmakers were lucky, or they made it last week. It almost seems as if the latter is true, because Hot Shots handling of Middle Eastern bad guys is just a little too heavy handed -- no, make that insulting and insensitive."
Hot Shots!,6.7,69467617,70,"Given that this is the first whacky comedy to come out of the Gulf War it’s a shame the whole enterprise isn’t a lot more tasteless, but the half-funny goings-on give that the script has been tailored not to offend a military machine on the point of massive war, perhaps at the expense of unpatriotic laughs. That said, it’s a pleasant enough time-waster, and doesn’t drag on too long."
Hot Shots!,6.7,69467617,63,Jim Abrahams tries to tap the zany Airplane! vein with this Top Gun spoof but bats far too low a percentage with the usual rapid-fire assault of numbingly stupid gags.
Hot Shots!,6.7,69467617,63,"The main difference between Naked Gun 2 1/2 and Hot Shots! is that almost half the jokes in Naked Gun 2 1/2 were at least slightly funny while in Hot Shots! less than a fifth are any good at all. [2 Aug 1991, p.C5]"
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,80,Possibly the most suspense-charged mountain-climbing movie ever made.
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,80,"Strong performances, particularly by Glenn as the hard-bitten climber with a private agenda, Vertical Limit delivers."
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,75,Vertical Limit is like riding a roller coaster for two hours. First it's frighteningly exciting. Then it's mind-numbing
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,75,"OK, so some of the scenes are a sham, but the mountain of suspense and adventure is enough to keep you captivated."
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,75,"Vertical Limit, despite its weaknesses, finds the right director in Martin Campbell to energize this high-altitude thriller."
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,70,A shell of a film. It's a stripped-down and blown-out thriller than can only be measured by the sum of its action sequences.
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,69,"By laying on disasters with a trowel, misses the chance to sweep us up into a more elegant fantasy of primitive mountaintop terror."
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,67,"If you were forced to judge it simply on its action-movie visual and technical elements, you'd have to count it a roaring success... . But if you lay aside that action and watch the people instead, it's a morass of dimwitted family crises and hack action-movie cliches."
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,63,The action scenes in Vertical Limit take cliffhanging to the highest peaks of excitement. It's a shame the story keeps dragging us down to sea level.
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,63,"One of the most thrilling - and authentic - mountain-climbing films in recent memory.  Unfortunately, it's also burdened by one of those every-line-a-wretched-cliché Hollywood screenplays."
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,63,"There is one reason, and only one, for anyone to check out Vertical Limit. The hanging-by-a-fingernail mountain-climbing sequences are spectacular."
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,60,Remains exciting as long as it stays on the mountains.
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,60,The film is well shot and has titillating action without a single persuasive emotion.
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,50,Relentless parade of tragedy.
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,50,"The movie has moments of breathtaking suspense, at least until it lapses into cartoonish implausibility in the second half. With good acting and good dialogue it might actually have been a good picture."
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,50,"Vertical Limit has its share of intrigue, but there ain't no mountain high enough to make O'Donnell look deep."
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,50,A climbing thriller whose plot may be on thin ice but whose action sequences are stunning.
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,50,"Vertical Limit's real problem is its digitized sheen. Every shot seems to have been CGI-enhanced, so the movie has an overpasteurized, Velveeta-like glow -- processed movie food."
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,40,"Wants to be a dizzy, precarious thrill ride. Glenn provides the only gravity that doesn't seem dull, literal and earthbound."
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,40,"So wound up in its own bungee cords, it leaves itself hopelessly tied in knots."
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,40,"Vertical Limit represents another kind of propaganda--namely the current Hollywood notion that the bigger and louder and longer a movie is, the more people will want to see it, even if that means getting numbed before your popcorn's cold."
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,40,"A thriller that, at its best, has the gooney absurdity of an old Saturday-afternoon movie serial."
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,40,Avalanches are nothing compared to the deadening touch of the stereotyping and audience-insulting simplicities in the scenic but brain-dead Vertical Limit.
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,38,"One of the most wearisome ""high adrenaline"" movies to come along in a while."
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,33,A shallow yet empty action extravaganza.
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,30,"It's a huge, bloated, hulking movie."
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,20,This asthma-inducing adventure set on K2 starts out seeming as if its corny storytelling and phony-looking settings were designed to show that it's as much about genre-movie conventions as anything else.
Vertical Limit,5.9,69243859,20,"The characters are as thin as the air at 26,000 feet, and the story as silly as anyone willing to assault K2 in a punishing blizzard."
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,75,A wild ride through nonstop visual effects yet a warm wallow in the cinema of the dumbed-down.
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,67,"Is any of this, you know, fun? Just barely. But I'm sure I would have loved it at 6."
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,63,This good movie could have been great if writer Akiva Goldsman had been able to -- or been permitted to -- dump the boundaries of the TV source altogether.
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,63,The story is unfocused and the character development is virtually nonexistent.
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,60,"Though there's an obvious, admirable effort to supply character development and plot twists, the set-work and special effects - both stylish and stunning - tend to dominate."
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,60,"Director Stephen Hopkins (Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child) and writer Akiva Goldsman (Batman and Robin) layer a ridiculous time-travel tale with the story of a dysfunctional family Robinson, impressive special effects, and IKEA does Star Wars production design."
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,50,"Time-travel cliches, female characters who exert authority only so we'll laugh at the pussy-whipped males, dialogue that's neither self-mocking nor serious, and an ostentatious though not particularly exciting production design keep the movie from taking off."
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,50,This effects-loaded extravaganza has more trouble finding its dramatic bearings than the Space Family Robinson has in figuring out where the heck in the universe they are.
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,50,The whole thing is fun for 11-year-olds of all ages.
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,50,"A pic that provides one hour's decent, eye-filling ride, then crashes and burns amid some of the worst writing since ... well, since scenarist/co-producer Akiva Goldsman's last effort, ""Batman & Robin."""
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,50,"The filmmakers can't decide what sort of picture they're trying to cook up, so they keep oscillating among shallow psychological drama, high-tech action sequences, and comedy scenes that are themselves an uneasy mixture of sitcom-style dialogue and self-mocking campiness."
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,50,"About the only thing that is lucid, in the malestrom of wham-bam effects, is the set-up for a sequel."
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,50,"The film has energy even when it hasn't much sense, in a manner that will strike most non-cultists as exhausting."
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,50,"The picture is a relentless blast of color and movement that's based on the old TV show, but boils down to a supercharged version of old-time Saturday-afternoon movie serials."
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,40,"Hardware doesn't make a movie; characters, be they Blawp or human, do. And as so often happens with such outsize undertakings, they are overwhelmed by the gizmos. Technology, one. Astros, naught."
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,40,"Episodically eventful but utterly unsuspenseful, the film is a diversion that requires little attention and satisfies the film-going needs of a wide variety of viewers."
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,38,"It's got cheesy special effects, a muddy visual look, and characters who say obvious things in obvious ways."
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,20,A galactic slump of a movie that stuffs its travel bag with special effects but forgets to pack the charm.
Lost in Space,5.1,69117629,10,"Dream up a plot incorporating time travel, genetic mutation, cyberjargon, and saving the Earth -- all the worst and most boring elements of science fiction. Finally, type up a list of bad jokes, space-talk, and semi-tough tag lines; label it ""script."""
Game Night,7,69001013,100,"Mark Perez has written one of the tightest comedy scripts to make it to be the big screen in ages. Game Night, directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, wastes not a single second of dialogue, gives killer lines to every member of its all-star ensemble, delivers genuinely tense action sequences, and even goes for broke with style."
Game Night,7,69001013,92,"Fast and funny, filled with memorable characters, and able to balance slapstick and violence without spilling too far in either direction, this frenetic R-rated farce is that rare comic gem that lands on all the spaces without ever going to jail."
Game Night,7,69001013,90,"It takes real intelligence to make the best dumb jokes. Game Night has plenty of both, combining skilled filmmaking and ridiculous gags in equal measure, and letting the seriousness and silliness play off of each other for maximum effect."
Game Night,7,69001013,88,"Watching Game Night is like witnessing someone on a hot streak while playing charades. As they keep nailing points for their team in rapid succession, you wonder how long they can sustain it. In Game Night, it’s the laughs that just keep coming."
Game Night,7,69001013,88,This is one of the best surprises of a still-young movie year: a comedy that takes nothing seriously except fun.
Game Night,7,69001013,83,"McAdams, whose comedic skills have gone unsung for way too long, is dizzy fun. The whole movie is, actually, even if it pretty much evaporates on impact — a kooky, vicarious loop of Mad Libs meets Cards Against Humanity, where whoever’s holding the popcorn last wins."
Game Night,7,69001013,80,"With its clever, whip-smart script and enthusiastic ensemble cast firing on all cylinders, crime comedy filmmakers John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein score big with Game Night."
Game Night,7,69001013,75,"It maintains its cheekiness while poking fun at the overused concept of redemption. Most importantly, it stays funny up to the beginning of the end credits, and maybe a little beyond."
Game Night,7,69001013,75,A riotous dark comedy in which a cute suburban get-together becomes a lethal nightmare.
Game Night,7,69001013,75,"The overall results are unusually wholesome – and satisfyingly funny. Game Night is the kind of harmless comedy you rarely see these days, as happily entertaining as a good game of Pictionary."
Game Night,7,69001013,75,"Game Night is a winner, plain and simple. Brisk and engaging (and surprisingly powered by a score from Cliff Martinez that’s expectedly great), this is a comedy that’s worth rolling the dice on."
Game Night,7,69001013,75,"It’s not a movie that will make you tired, but lack of ambition can sometimes be a strength. This is a comedy-thriller made simply to please in the moment, and it does, for almost every minute of its 100-minute running time."
Game Night,7,69001013,75,"Game Night is not the greatest comedy in the world, but it has a great grasp of the ingredient that makes comedy work, identified centuries ago as brevity."
Game Night,7,69001013,75,Bateman's dazzling deadpan can raise tired zingers to raucous life with only a throwaway eyebrow lift. And McAdams takes to comedy with a natural actor's grace and precision. Talk about fun company. They're it.
Game Night,7,69001013,75,"There are more than enough laughs and clever surprises in this broad and sometimes violent farce to warrant a recommendation, thanks to a solidly funny script by Mark Perez, some pretty neat camera moves and choreographed action/comedic sequences from directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein — and a likable and talented ensemble cast, led by two of my favorites."
Game Night,7,69001013,75,"A charismatic ensemble cast, a sharp script and a few well-placed twists make Game Night one of the more enjoyable big studio comedies in recent memory."
Game Night,7,69001013,75,"It’s essentially David Fincher’s The Game matched with the comic overtones of Horrible Bosses, which is why it winds up being an entertaining jaunt."
Game Night,7,69001013,75,"At first, you may be inclined to reject it outright, but Game Night works so hard to win viewers over that it eventually finds its way to a winning formula."
Game Night,7,69001013,70,The back and forth between McAdams and Bateman is what makes Game Night sing.
Game Night,7,69001013,70,"It won’t fix the studio comedy, but it’s a welcome, watchable outlier for now."
Game Night,7,69001013,70,"It’s a good time, but it maybe could have been a great one. Which I suppose is true of so many nights meant to deliver us from the doldrums of settled life. I don’t think that meta-ness is a deliberate feature of Game Night. But with all the sharpness Daley and Goldstein show us here, I’m not ruling it out, either."
Game Night,7,69001013,70,"It’s ridiculous, far-fetched — absurdist, even. Some, or even a lot, of the jokes are stupid. But thanks in part to a terrific cast, expert timing and an all-in aesthetic, it's really funny."
Game Night,7,69001013,70,"A lot of the jokes are surprising, and one gag...pays off terrifically. The two top stars are delightful, and a couple of cameos are nice surprises."
Game Night,7,69001013,70,"The movie manipulates its audience in cunning and puckish ways. It’s no big whoop, but you’re happy to have been played."
Game Night,7,69001013,67,"Game Night is one of those comedy tweeners in which the jokes that click are milked too long and jokes that don’t will take too long to confirm that. Appropriately for the premise, it’ll likely be more enjoyable at home with friends."
Game Night,7,69001013,67,"This tame but fitfully funny goof on suspense cinema at least assembles an agreeable guest list.... As with any real game night, the company is more important than the game."
Game Night,7,69001013,63,"Like a real-life game night, the comedy may not leave a lasting impression, but it’s plenty of fun while it lasts."
Game Night,7,69001013,63,"Game Night itself is not a long night; it’s reasonably snappy. But co-directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein place a misjudged emphasis on keeping the violence and the action “real,” so at its most routine and generic, the movie forgets it’s supposed to be a comedy."
Game Night,7,69001013,63,The film establishes coherent characters and drops them into a twisty mystery plot that’s tightly crafted enough to generate some real narrative momentum while never getting too bogged down in its own plot that it forgets to be funny.
Game Night,7,69001013,63,"Way too much of Game Night is given away in the trailer, the violence is a bit much and truth be told — the folding in on itself plot gets in its own way, especially in the third act. But Bateman makes the big bucks for being the best put-upon “hero” in comedy. And McAdams, doing an epic Amanda Plummer (“Pulp You Know What,” remember?) absolutely steals the picture."
Game Night,7,69001013,60,"The set-pieces are quick, light and for the most part fun. What Game Night lacks in (any) plausibility or coherence it makes up for in Friday night, pleasingly brainless entertainment."
Game Night,7,69001013,60,The Jason Bateman comedy model hasn’t quite been radically altered in Game Night but it’s one of his more entertaining outings. Just don’t count on remembering much of it once the night is over.
Game Night,7,69001013,55,It’s hard to say Game Night is entirely bad. I laughed a lot and its creators are clearly capable of crafting a joke. Yet they seem to have either an incomplete or an incredibly cynical conception of what a movie is.
Game Night,7,69001013,50,"The movie relies rather too heavily on McAdams’ charm, sort of like a limp cheeseburger that’s saved by some really good bacon. But hey, sometimes a fast-food cheeseburger satisfies, more or less."
Game Night,7,69001013,50,"The film owes what charm it has to a whip-smart script (heavy on double entendres – a delight for word nerds and game geeks alike), and the chemistry between its actors."
Game Night,7,69001013,50,"For all the energy that Rachel McAdams, Jason Bateman, and their castmates pour into their gimmicky comedy, there’s too often a feeling that they’re straining to pump up flat material."
Game Night,7,69001013,50,The movie is a pointed reminder that Ms. McAdams is one of cinema’s most accomplished and appealing comic actresses. It’s almost heartbreaking to contemplate how amazing she would be in a new comedy that was more than intermittently O.K.
Game Night,7,69001013,50,"There are chuckles here and there, but a striking absence of belly laughs; Girls Trip it’s decidedly not."
Game Night,7,69001013,40,"Bateman and McAdams have some fun with the gonzo goofiness of the project, and milk a couple of comedy set-pieces—like one about a gunshot wound and a squeaky toy—but the flatness of their characters leaves no room for relatability."
Game Night,7,69001013,40,"Certainly you expect a good time from Bateman and McAdams, who give their banter just the right sly, sportive rhythm even when the lines and situations themselves come up short."
Game Night,7,69001013,40,"The movie’s only vaguely human presence is Sharon Horgan (the gifted writer and star of TV’s Catastrophe), who gazes upon the manufactured gags with an air of chagrin. If the movie had risen even an inch to her level, Game Night might've had some game."
Sahara,6,68671925,75,The casting is so strong and the overall filmmaking flair of the movie is so captivating that it basically works.
Sahara,6,68671925,75,I enjoyed this movie on its own dumb level.
Sahara,6,68671925,70,"As Sahara careens between swashbuckling silliness and semi-serious comment, it builds up reserves of energy and good will that pay off when it bursts into its final sprint, a rootin'-tootin' 21-gun finale as satisfying as it is preposterous."
Sahara,6,68671925,67,Surprisingly entertaining.
Sahara,6,68671925,60,"About as good as a big, stupid American action movie can be without ever being anything better than a big, stupid American action movie."
Sahara,6,68671925,58,"This insanely busy, exceedingly long, and sometimes endearingly preposterous rendering has simply gotten the directions reversed in its insistence on sticking only to where men-who-make-adventure-flicks have gone before."
Sahara,6,68671925,50,"Action films can't be this consistently absurd, can't paint their heroes into such dangerous corners, from which only cocktails of luck and divine intervention can save them, over and over. It's a bad-faith bargain with the audience and bad storytelling."
Sahara,6,68671925,50,"Saddled with more industry/celebrity baggage than a high-class safari voyage, Sahara is a rousing and only occasionally ridiculous adventure yarn."
Sahara,6,68671925,50,"Takes the action/adventure story to new heights of preposterousness. In a way, that's not a bad thing, since it allows a certain level of guilty enjoyment."
Sahara,6,68671925,50,"The movie, first preposterously entertaining and then just preposterous, makes James Bond films look as logical as Euclidean geometry."
Sahara,6,68671925,50,"It's not that Sahara is offensively bad: It's just that the picture, loud and busy as it is, never really finds its own identity."
Sahara,6,68671925,50,Spectacularly silly and perversely entertaining.
Sahara,6,68671925,50,"Rojas is played by Penélope Cruz, who's endearing enough, but still comes across coarse and irritating every time she attempts a role in English."
Sahara,6,68671925,50,"McConaughey, despite alarmingly orange makeup, does justice to the role, a hard-drinking, shipwreck- hunting senator's son with a 007 way with the ladies."
Sahara,6,68671925,50,"Breck Eisner, son of former Disney mogul Michael and something of a protégé of Steven Spielberg, for whom he directed an episode of the miniseries ""Taken,"" guides Sahara's big action set pieces with assurance, but would have been better served by a tighter script."
Sahara,6,68671925,50,"The film clocks in at under two hours, but the last 20 minutes feel like 40."
Sahara,6,68671925,50,I'm still trying to wrap my head around the historical premise for this Indiana Jones knockoff.
Sahara,6,68671925,50,"If the filmmakers had spent $14.98 of that $100 mil on a DVD of ""The Mummy,"" they might have learned a few things: You need a head villain who is surpassingly evil, you need some jokes that get laughs - and a few sword-fighting skeletons wouldn't hurt."
Sahara,6,68671925,50,Eisner is not remotely up to the challenge. Spending millions on action scenes does not mean you get them right.
Sahara,6,68671925,50,Sahara doesn't waste time on introductions. It wastes time in other ways.
Sahara,6,68671925,50,Most of the personality work in the film is left to Steve Zahn.
Sahara,6,68671925,50,"It ain't art, and it's dumber than I'd like, but I don't imagine you were expecting Kieslowski."
Sahara,6,68671925,40,"Any movie starring Penelope Cruz or William H. Macy can't be all bad. And Sahara, which stars both Penelope Cruz and William H. Macy, proves the point: It isn't all bad."
Sahara,6,68671925,40,"McConaughey is usually a welcome presence, but here, he looks like making the movie was getting in the way of his exciting African adventure."
Sahara,6,68671925,40,"This perfectly distracting, ultimately unsatisfying film feels like a James Bond flick in which the stand-in got the lead."
Sahara,6,68671925,40,"Just don't go expecting complex moral and ethical quandaries and you'll likely never think of ""Ishtar"" even once."
Sahara,6,68671925,40,"Sahara is many things, but it is not a movie. It is the skull-splitting cacophony of 21 producers and four screenwriters (that we know about, anyway) standing in the same room shouting into their cell phones."
Sahara,6,68671925,38,"In the end, the thing that Cussler's fans will probably object to most is the nonsensical way Sahara manhandles his story."
Sahara,6,68671925,30,"McConaughey remains more buffed than compelling. He's not helped by a two-hour convolution of episodes that are too busy imitating other, better movies."
Sahara,6,68671925,30,"The greatest hits of '70s bar-rock soundtrack - ""We're an American Band,"" ""Right Place, Wrong Time,"" ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" ""Magic Carpet Ride"" etc. - has a certain rollicking, kick-ass energy that, unfortunately, never rubs off on the movie."
Sahara,6,68671925,25,An adventure in mediocrity that brings together some of the worst current techniques and trends.
Sahara,6,68671925,20,"Sahara is a mediocrity wrapped inside a banality, toasted in a nice, fresh cliche."
Sahara,6,68671925,10,"A stunning piece of work--stunningly inept, stunningly incoherent, stunningly awful in every single way imaginable."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,90,"George MacDonald Fraser, Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson are responsible for the story and screenplay, which was directed by John Glen, who does much better than he did with ""For Your Eyes Only."" However, the material is markedly better, and the budget seems noticeably larger. Peter Lamont's production design is both extravagant and funny."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,90,"One of the snazziest, wittiest productions in the history of the serial."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,80,"This finds Bond on better form than he's been for some time. The action sequences are tighter, the visual gags more inventive, and if the plot is no great shakes, the whole thing is served up with a decent approximation to the old panache."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,80,Film’s high points are the spectaccular aerial stuntwork marking both the pre-credits teaser and extremely dangerous-looking climax.
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,80,"One for the die hards. The saving grace here is a knowing sense of humour so lacking in its predecessor, For Your Eyes Only."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,63,"There's a fine line between wit and absurdity, and this particular movie too often falls on the wrong side."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,63,"Glen's willingness to give the action sequences a certain weight and seriousness produces some genuinely exciting moments, yet his work is everywhere undermined by the flatness of the characterizations and the uncertain architecture of the plot. Still, Maud Adams makes a nice impression and Roger Moore has shed some of his smarminess."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,60,"Directed by John Glen, who keeps the excitement level high for an hour or so, then lets the show slip into the doldrums."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,60,"OCTOPUSSY features the usual array of fine stunt work and special effects, and Adams' appearance marks the first time that a Bond woman was allowed an encore performance, but little is added that departs from the Bond formula."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,50,"When he had started playing this game of Save the Planet—when he was roguish Sean Connery and the world was so much younger—Bond had been a kind of role model for people of a certain class and ambition. Savoir-faire meant the aristocracy of style: which wine to decant, which brand of cigarette to smoke, which automatic weapon to carry under the armpit. Now that he was Roger Moore, 20 years later, Bond had degenerated into a male model, and something of a genial anachronism."
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,100,"In the end this is Hoffman's movie, and it's refreshing, finally, to see him not as an oddball or eccentric but as a decent, capable guy who is ultimately a lot more intense than most people."
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,88,"The thriller occupies the same territory as countless science fiction movies about deadly invasions and high-tech conspiracies, but has been made with intelligence and an appealing human dimension."
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,83,"Petersen pulls off the thrills at a stomach lurching pace, and with its requisite Hollywood ham - husband and wife reuniting over piles of haemorrhaging bodies - loud performances, crashing stunts and a fearsome, hypochondria-inducing conceit, there's barely room to catch your breath, let alone cry foul."
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,80,"Outbreak is sharp, sometimes-exploitative entertainment that does its job with great efficiency."
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,80,Outbreak is an absolute hoot thanks primarily to director Wolfgang Petersen's rabid pacing and the great care he brings to setting up the story and its probability.
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,75,It's a B-movie with A-accouterments.
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,75,"Whether scarily charting the spread of the virus or choreographing a cat-and-mouse chase of choppers above a winding riverbed, Petersen demonstrates a smooth stylistic savvy that keeps the film highly absorbing from beginning to end."
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,70,"For today’s filmmakers, the addiction to kinetic overkill has become a disease in itself."
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,70,This movie is an entertaining and sometimes wildly-exhilarating ride.
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,67,Outbreak is fast on its feet and simple in its head.
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,63,Outbreak has the feel of a movie written by a committee of writers -- it's totally lacking in personality.
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,63,"The effort to turn Outbreak into an action picture insures that little of it will be believable, regardless of how much scientific data has been woven into the story. The film's shallowness also contributes to the impression that no problem is too thorny to be solved by movie heroics."
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,63,"There's too much hardware, too little sense. Too much blood, too little flesh. Too much program, too little mind. That's the virus of the contemporary movie techno-thriller."
Sudden Impact,6.7,67642693,75,"Sudden Impact is a Dirty Harry movie with only the good parts left in. All the slow stuff, such as character, motivation, atmosphere and plot, has been pared to exactly the minimum necessary to hold together the violence."
Sudden Impact,6.7,67642693,75,"A viscerally effective, fast paced thriller."
Sudden Impact,6.7,67642693,70,"A brutally hard-hitting policier which casts Clint Eastwood as audiences like to see him, as the toughest guy in town."
Sudden Impact,6.7,67642693,70,"The film is split down the middle, with many elegant symmetries and curling plotlines bridging the two halves: one part is a bracing, funny, almost Keaton-esque comedy starring Harry as a deadpan center of disaster; the other is a brooding, brutal film noir, starring Sondra Locke as a vengeful femme fatale."
Sudden Impact,6.7,67642693,63,"Eastwood keeps things moving at a furious pace and the series' formula of having a steely-eyed ""dinosaur"" like Harry cutting through the red tape and vanquishing the scum of the earth remains irresistible."
Sudden Impact,6.7,67642693,63,The real problem here is technical; Eastwood the director is far less sure-footed than he was with the likes of Play Misty for Me or The Outlaw Josey Wales.
Sudden Impact,6.7,67642693,60,"Unfortunately, it fizzles after a fast-paced, action-packed, full-of-business-and-bullets beginning...It's not the fault of Eastwood the actor, who's still every bit the spaghetti samurai. It's Eastwood the director, with his flashbacks and symbolism, who misjudges the pace.""Sudden Impact probably isn't worth a few dollars more."
Sudden Impact,6.7,67642693,60,It's difficult to view Sudden Impact as anything more exciting or authentic than the action movie equivalent of drawn-out foreplay and faked orgasm.
Sudden Impact,6.7,67642693,50,"The screenplay is ridiculous, and Mr. Eastwood's direction of it primitive, which is surprising because he has shown himself capable in such films as ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'' and ''The Gauntlet.''"
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,63,"Far more than most action stars getting on in years, Bruce Willis has aged nicely into the role. Maybe it’s that shaved pate of his, a bullet-head that still looks primed for any chamber."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,60,"Willis himself could not appear less enthusiastic in the role, and doesn’t phone in his performance here so much as clip it to a nearby pigeon and hope for the best. Yet perversely, his apparent lack of interest works rather well: McClane, after all, is now a grizzled back-number who has bumbled his way into a younger man’s action movie."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,50,"For all its mayhem, for all the smashing windows and kabooming fireballs, the grenade launchers and giant helicopters, A Good Day to Die Hard not only fails to top its predecessors, it also forgets the basic Die Hard rules."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,50,"We have entered generic action movie territory and the idiosyncrasies that made the series special at the outset have been leeched out, papered over, or turned into obligatory inserts."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,50,"If there is to be a sequel to this thudding slab of cacophony, why not just go all the way and make John McClane a superhero?"
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,50,"Willis still packs that rapscallion charm, balancing his wisecracking, reluctant-hero shtick with the unstoppable, all-American quality that earned the original film its title. But the chemistry between him and Courtney is nonexistent, with the younger thesp, who makes co-star Cole Hauser look expressive, adding so little to the equation, one can only hope the studio doesn't plan to pass the franchise on to him."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,50,"In the way of workaday flicks built around long-in-the-tooth badasses, Die Hard 5 leaves room for McClane to make a few jokes about his thinning hair and to rue that he wasn't a better father when his kids were growing up. Oh, boo-hoo."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,50,"To paraphrase a classic of Reagan-era cinema, A Good Day to Die Hard is a bad day to stop sniffing glue."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,50,"While some of the sequels have been entertaining enough, A Good Day to Die Hard signals that it may be a better day for John McClane to retire."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,42,"At this point, ""Die Hard"" no longer describes the franchise. It describes the fans who are still willing to turn out for the noise and nonsense."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,42,"Until now, the sequels have gotten away with the cynical franchising of John McClane, but A Good Day To Die Hard, the worst entry in the series by far, exposes the hollowness and stupidity of McClane 2.0."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,42,"The fifth edition of the franchise, A Good Day to Die Hard, is the brawniest and most brainless of the bunch."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,40,"I hesitate to ask, but did anyone actually tell McClane, before he arrived, that the Cold War is over?"
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,40,I don't think it knows where it's going. I'm not even sure it cares.
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,40,"“That was exciting!” says Willis after he and Courtney survive a 20-storey leap through a plate glass window. “Want to go again?” Frankly, Bruce, we’re fine to leave it here."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,40,"A few reasonable action sequences are mired in family soap, making this A Good Day To Call It Quits."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,40,"Australian actor Courtney does the honors as the younger McClane, skillfully matching Willis in action sequences, one-liners, and more extended repartee."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,38,There are two problems with A Good Day to Die Hard: It’s terribly filmed and nothing in it makes any sense.
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,38,"Like the Bond movies, the ""Die Hard"" films thrive on brilliantly wicked villains. In this edition, we barely know which bad guy is the main bad guy. The script is filled with heavy-handed dialogue about parents and their children, framed by well choreographed but generic action sequences."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,38,The best thing about A Good Day to Die Hard is its title.
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,38,"Isn't just the weakest of the ""Die Hard"" pictures; it's a lousy action movie on its own terms."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,38,"Loud and tedious, “Die Hard 5” is a shaky-cam/Sensuround blast of bullets and bombs, digital explosions and death defying feats of defying death."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,37,"Both assaultive and tiresome, A Good Day to Die Hard barely registers on the action movie Richter scale. It goes bang, it goes boom, and then it blessedly goes away."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,33,A Good Day To Die Hard isn’t dead on arrival because that would suggest it has a pulse.
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,30,"The absence of a single noteworthy villain is perhaps this movie’s most salient flaw (along with the jumbled, barely coherent editing of a seemingly endless chase through a Moscow traffic jam)."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,30,"It’s the lamest and most vacant of the quintet — though if you mistakenly think you’re buying a ticket to a demolition derby instead of a night at the movies, you’ll feel right at home."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,30,"A Good Day to Die Hard plays like an extended victory lap for star Bruce Willis and the entire ""Die Hard"" franchise. Not surprising, but not overwhelmingly entertaining either."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,30,"Unfortunately, John Moore has directed these sequences in a way that makes the incidents look so far-fetched and essentially unsurvivable that you can only laugh."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,30,"Everything that made the first “Die Hard” memorable — the nuances of character, the political subtext, the cowboy wit — has been dumbed down or scrubbed away entirely."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,25,"Time to give the shoot-’em-up thing a rest, guys: It’s tired and played out, and so are you."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,25,"Ah jeez. I actually wanted this one to be good. Or at least decent. Or at least a reminder of what got us all fired up about the first Die Hard in 1988. But A Good Day To Die Hard, the fifth in a creatively exhausted series, is total crap."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,25,"It has a weak story that provides no tension, feeling or interest. Its opening action sequence is just a long, drawn-out dud, filmed by director John Moore in the worst modern style of quick cuts and smeary, jittery photography."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,25,"Actually, Bruce, what stinks is the script — which is woefully lacking the kind of one-liners and memorable bad guys that helped make working-class hero McClane so iconic he’s still around after 25 years. Even the action sequences are pretty much by the numbers this time."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,25,"The film feels like it was reverse-engineered from its ""Yippee Ki-Yay Mother Russia"" tagline, a wholly generic international actioner barely distinguished by the presence of Bruce Willis's banner hero."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,20,"A Good Day to Die Hard is the opposite of a labor of love. It has no good lines, no crackerjack fights, and only one mildly orgasmic revenge killing. It will satisfy no one — high-, low-, or middlebrow. Die Hard is finally in its death throes."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,20,Pretty much three well-staged action sequences strung together with the dumbest imaginable connective tissue.
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,20,"We’re a long way from this shoot-’em-up franchise’s John McTiernan–helmed heyday. Willis gives one of his laziest ever performances, leadenly tossing off each quip (“I’m on vacation!” is the most abused) and acting like he’s passing a kidney stone during the bathetic father-son bonding scenes."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,20,"Ultimately, even more than 2007’s “Live Free or Die Hard,” “Good Day” never lets McClane be McClane. Gone is his taunting snark and quick-witted preparedness; instead he seems like a jerk with a thing for guns."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,16,"The entire enterprise is a bewildering mess, put in place only to frustrate and alienate anyone who buys a ticket.  Every action scene is telegraphed, and most of the dialogue is irrevocably stupid."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,10,"For anyone who remembers the ""Die Hard"" adventures at their vital and exciting best, this film feels like a near-death experience."
A Good Day to Die Hard,5.3,67349198,10,The movie is constructed like a window some kid broke and then tried to glue back together.
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,80,"It's entertaining with a crafty mixture of action, humor and drama."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,75,"After an excellent setup, the movie becomes bogged down in chase scene after chase scene on its way to its inevitable ending."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,75,"May not make adults feel as if they're 10 again, but it will awaken their memories of Saturday matinees that upped children's adrenaline without blinding them with Day-Glo colors or insulting their intelligence."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,75,"The planet-hopping children have special talents -- telekinesis, telepathy etc. -- although it is the high-wattage lovability of Mr Rock that's the real superpower on display here."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,75,"Race to Witch Mountain isn't some kind of action watershed, or science-fiction milestone, but it most certainly is a finely crafted reboot of a franchise that was ripe for an updating."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,70,"Strikes a deft balance of chase-movie suspense and wisecracking humor, with a few slam-bang action setpieces that would shame the makers of more allegedly grown-up genre fare."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,70,"A fast and furious (yes ""fast and furious"" in that way) wild ride of a movie in which the good guys are good (some of them really, really good), the bad guys are good (very scary good) and the car chases (around a thousand of them by my count, though it was hard to keep track with all the screeching tires and twisted metal) are pretty spectacular."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,63,I think Dwayne Johnson has a likable screen presence and is a good choice for an innocuous family entertainment like this.
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,63,"The action beats are so relentless, no sooner does one chase end than another begins."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,60,"A calculated bid to turn the Rock into a more family-friendly commodity. That calculation may be transparent, but it pays off: Cracking one-liners and alternating between world-weariness and growing affection for his charges, Johnson is wonderful -- much better than his material."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,60,"While ""Escape"" was superior in story, ""Race"" does commit to an impressive scope. What it is, really, is a big-studio popcorn flick that just happens to be made for tweens."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,60,"Race to Witch Mountain has Johnson, who lifts the script above its conventional cat-and-mouse stratagems with his buoyant wiseacre timing."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,60,"With its chase scenes, shoot-outs, explosions, and special effects, this looks more like Jerry Bruckheimer product than a traditional Disney feature. But there are also some light-hearted moments, the best occurring at a UFO convention where the aliens seem more normal than the earthlings."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,60,"An unexpectedly entertaining mixture of good, clean Disney fun with some rather more modern action scenes, lent charm by Johnson’s natural swagger. One of the better family films in a while."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,50,"Curiously, despite Johnson's imposing physique, it's the kids who do most of the smashing and grabbing, right up until the climax, when it's all-hands-on-neck."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,50,"Parents might like the film, but will be too busy explaining the complicated plot to their children to really enjoy it."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,50,"Modest and diverting, rough and bland, with some good (if not quite Bette Davis caliber) actors and so-so special effects."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,50,Mediocre family fare that's simply not that much fun.
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,50,"The Rock charms you through the worst of it, but the effects are cheap, the dialogue is about as challenging as a ""Hannah Montana"" episode, and the pace manages to be both brisk and numbing."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,50,Young male earthlings should like everything about Race to Witch Mountain. Just make sure you race your caffeinated charges to the washrooms right after the movie to defuel so there won't be any accidents on the space shuttle home.
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,50,"This is not a story that cries out to be remade every 15-20 years. And, while the special effects and acting are getting better, the story isn't."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,50,"Director Andy Fickman, who previously blanded Johnson up in ""The Game Plan,"" has fashioned the film into a one-size-fits-all, action-packed special-effects extravaganza for the whole family."
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,50,Race can satisfy with a steady pace.
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,50,Fans of the original films will dig Richards and Eisenmann's cameo appearances.
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,40,This is filmmaking by the numbers meant to succeed by the numbers.
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,38,This is not a movie. It's a coming attraction for a theme park.
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,25,Bears all the signs of having been composed by an inferior race of alien screenwriters from the Hackulon System.
Race to Witch Mountain,5.7,67172594,25,"Wow, when Disney misses the ""reimagining"" mark, it really misses."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,80,"This corny and manipulative movie taxes your ability to suspend disbelief and predictably punishes characters for their hubris--earmarks of a great disaster flick, if the tone is just right."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,70,"While the plot is thin and there's little action till the big blow some 60 minutes into the film, a volcano offers a greater variety of thrills than your basic cyclone ever could."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,70,"Dante's Peak is predictable from start to finish, but the video-game style action and effects never let up long enough for you to remember how absurd it all is. It's a blast."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,63,"Dante's Peak, written by Leslie Bohem and directed by Roger Donaldson, follows the disaster formula so faithfully that if you walk in while the movie is in progress, you can estimate how long the story has to run. That it is skillful is a tribute to the filmmakers."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,63,"Director Roger Donaldson (""Smash Palace,"" ""No Way Out,"" ""Species""), working from a script by Leslie Bohem (""Daylight""),does a serviceable job, wrapping his narrative around the big kabooms, but the real interest comes from the extraordinary barrage of sound and spectacle."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,63,"The special effects are suitably catastrophic, though they aren't much more clever than the computer tricks that turn up in beer commercials these days."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,60,"This is yet another one of those mindlessly enjoyable outings which eschews such unimportant details as plot or characterisation in favour of the biggest, flashiest special effects money can buy. Twister with lava, if you will."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,60,"Writer Leslie Bohem and director Roger Donaldson brush briskly through the standard scientific and romantic blather. They know that in movies like this, complexity is the province of the special-effects people."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,60,"It hardly helps, of course, to have no characters to root for. What is it about Pierce Brosnan? He's got dimples, grace, charm; he's not a movie star, exactly -- he looks as if he should be hosting something."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,58,"""Twister"" is a rush. Dante's Peak, on the other hand, is a bore. Oh, it has its moments, but most of them are concentrated in the final forty-five minutes. The first hour, which is all typical disaster movie setup, is interminable."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,50,It seems almost beside the point to bring up the notion of plotting and characterization in such an effects-driven film ; nobody's going to rush out to catch Dante's Peak on account of the Shakespearean-caliber thespians involved.
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,50,"Dante's Peak is customary for the genre, with convincing special effects sharing screen time with standard-issue characters and situations."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,50,"Physicality of the second half, then, will keep the audience going, but it is not quite sufficient to camouflage the elemental silliness of storyline."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,50,"As boring as the special effects are, they far outshine the stultifying plot."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,30,The special effects are definitely the best thing about this curiously bland disasterthon.
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,30,"These lessons are driven home via silly dialogue (""Her name was Marion and she loved volcanoes..."") and painfully predictable plot complications, repeated often enough that there's no need to take notes, except for the benefit of friends who fall asleep."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,30,"Approximately the last hour of Dante's Peak is made up of action scenes, and how well one likes computer-generated destruction will determine how well one likes the movie."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,25,Dante's Peak expands the concept of badness in movies.
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,25,"The dialogue is utterly inane, but the high-tech effects deliver the sort of thrills that disaster-film connoisseurs expect."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,25,"Too bad that by the time the volcano shoots its wad, the movie has already died a thousand deaths, ground to a halt by the interminable waiting for the damn thing to blow."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,70,"As formula films go, The Bounty Hunter is more enjoyable than most, even if it packs in as many cliches as any."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,50,"In The Bounty Hunter, the couple that foils a bunch of tiresome grade-C thriller goons together stays together. Whether or not that's a recipe for love, it's certainly not a formula for romantic-comedy magic."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,40,The mishmash ends up as a thoroughly unfunny adult cartoon.
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,40,"This dire battle-of-the-exes action-comedy severely tests audience goodwill by running an indulgent 110 minutes, crammed as it is with half-baked thriller subplots and aimless supporting characters, as if to distract from the central duo's nonstop bickering."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,40,"Try as they might, Nicole and Milo, as they are called in the movie, don't steam. Wispy vapors is about as good as it gets."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,38,"Aniston doesn’t bring her old A-game to this. But at least she’s not quiet and reserved and no-energy, her approach to too many roles of late. Butler makes the most of his Neanderthal rut."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,38,"Why, oh, why, was this movie necessary?"
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,38,"We have to take the sexual tension on faith, as with everything in this formulaic glob of a script."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,38,"Tennant aims for a contemporary version of ""The Thin Man,"" wedding the banter of sparring spouses with sleuth work. To say that he falls short of the mark is understatement."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,38,"The Bounty Hunter does give Christine Baranski, as an Atlantic City entertainer and Mama Aniston, another opportunity to enthrall us with her drag-queenliness."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,38,"Even if The Bounty Hunter is more plot-driven than your standard romantic comedy, it's never quite as funny as it should be."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,30,The script has all the spunk of Ikea-bookcase assembly instructions.
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,30,"Inexplicably, Butler continues to get work in romantic comedies despite his limited range and boorish persona."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,30,"For his sins poor Stewart is kidnapped, tortured and shot up with horse tranquilizer after his leg is broken. It’s disturbing, and somewhat baffling too, until you grasp that this hapless sucker is a surrogate for the audience."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,30,"The only thing that Butler and Aniston have in common, however, is identical Aruba-bronze skin tones: they seem to have been sprayed with the same can."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,25,Perhaps tracking down the folks responsible for this film should be Milo's next assignment.
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,25,"Yes, it's every bit as brainless as the trailers suggest."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,25,"Tennant and his actors have done the bare minimum to carry their lifeless movie past the finish line, and their apathy reads a lot like contempt."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,25,"If there's anything to like about The Bounty Hunter, it's Christine Baranski doing a Joan Rivers impersonation."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,25,A painfully contrived romantic comedy/thriller that may (or may not) have brought Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston together as a real-life couple.
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,25,"That's what The Bounty Hunter has rustled up -- along with a listless rom-com, a feeble thriller and a supporting cast of clueless characters."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,25,Works overtime for just a handful of chuckles and a few big yuks.
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,25,None of these complaints would matter if The Bounty Hunter possessed even a smidgen of inspired comedy. It doesn't.
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,20,This synthetic comedy is instantly grating.
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,20,A comedy of remarriage that makes divorce look like a state of grace.
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,20,"If ""Midnight Run"" and ""His Girl Friday"" had an unwanted, mutant baby, it would be The Bounty Hunter, a romantic comedy where the jokes sputter and die immediately after exiting the character’s mouths."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,20,You know it’s bad when a caper comedy makes you long for the Goldie Hawn–Chevy Chase showcases of yore.
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,12,"Slack when it should be tight, dull when it needs to be sharp, The Bounty Hunter represents a failed attempt to make an Elmore Leonard movie without having to pay Elmore Leonard money."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,12,"Someday, The Bounty Hunter and last month’s “Cop Out” will be featured in a cable movie double bill as the two worst 1988 films of 2010."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,0,"At points, the film sinks below the level of competent."
The Bounty Hunter,5.6,67061228,0,Barely worthy of a legitimate theatrical release.

Kangaroo Jack,4.4,66934963,20,"Bruckheimer shifts from high-concept historical romance ""Pearl Harbor"" and high-concept T&A ""Coyote Ugly"" to a first attempt at high-concept light comedy, yet only his fondness for dragging acting talent down with him carries over."
Kangaroo Jack,4.4,66934963,20,"For auds unwilling or unable to grapple with the subtle nuances of ""Scooby Doo,"" Warners now gives us Kangaroo Jack, a shrill and silly farce."
Kangaroo Jack,4.4,66934963,11,"Indeed, the largely computer-generated Jack acts the pants off his co-stars, which can and should be taken with a whole trough full of salt."
Kangaroo Jack,4.4,66934963,10,"Straight from the fiery, churning bowels of high-concept hell comes Kangaroo Jack, Bruckheimer's idea of kid-friendly fare, and some of the longest 90 minutes ever committed to film."
Kangaroo Jack,4.4,66934963,10,"What better to do with such a quiet, majestic landscape than to liven it up with the noise and vulgarity of lowest-common-denominator American pop culture?"
Kangaroo Jack,4.4,66934963,10,"Were it not for the involvement of producer Bruckheimer, who has made billions by conning millions into believing they can't live without his celluloid crack, it's doubtful Kangaroo Jack would even exist. As it stands now, the ""movie"" barely exists anyway."

Kangaroo Jack,4.4,66934963,0,"Virtually every shot of the kangaroo was digitally created, and perhaps that was an insurance policy masterstroke. Forcing a real live one to act opposite these co-stars could have easily constituted animal cruelty."
End of Days,5.7,66889043,75,"May prove too dark to make the list of Schwarzenegger's biggest hits. But the movie suggests the actor still has a lot to offer -- and he's willing to take some chances, too. Welcome back, Arnold."
End of Days,5.7,66889043,75,A credible action spectacular.
End of Days,5.7,66889043,67,Arnold has a gem for the third millennium in End of Days.
End of Days,5.7,66889043,63,For the most part it's a blast.
End of Days,5.7,66889043,60,"It's good to see Schwarzenegger doing his thing again after what, for him, was a long sabbatical."
End of Days,5.7,66889043,60,"Frequently silly, yet eminently more watchable than such leaden Schwarzenegger efforts as ''Eraser.''"
End of Days,5.7,66889043,58,"Beginnings don't come much more lurid than this, and the rest of End of Days never quite reaches this level of flat-out wildness again."
End of Days,5.7,66889043,50,"Peter Hyams, a pretty good cinematographer but a mediocre director, goes to work on a script by Andrew W. Marlowe that's designed to carry us from one bit of hyperbole to the next."
End of Days,5.7,66889043,50,"Not a campy film, but it revels in extremes, and has the same sort of appeal."
End of Days,5.7,66889043,50,There are forces here you couldn't possibly comprehend...You can say that again.
End of Days,5.7,66889043,50,"Nothing worse than a silly movie that takes itself seriously, that bores us to death while we wait for the finale that comes too late."

End of Days,5.7,66889043,40,"All fire-and-brimstone bunk, a tired compendium of involuntary crucifixions, grim messages carved into human flesh, fly buzzings, ominous choral chants on the soundtrack and at least one head twisting."
End of Days,5.7,66889043,40,Drab and depressing.
End of Days,5.7,66889043,40,A dud.
End of Days,5.7,66889043,38,"85 percent explosions and editing idiocy (a window can't break without director Peter Hyams cutting between five different angles) and 15 percent Arnold trying to grow a third dimension. Seeing him try for ""sad"" is like watching a dog try to talk."

End of Days,5.7,66889043,33,"Too bad (Arnold) can't save the movie from it's superstitious clap-trap, sadistic violence, and sheer silliness."
End of Days,5.7,66889043,30,It's brain-dead start to finish.
End of Days,5.7,66889043,30,"The movie equivalent of the fruitcake you get every year from the folks back home. It's brick-heavy and full of nasty bits you don't want to put in your mouth, lovingly wrapped in pink cellophane."
End of Days,5.7,66889043,30,"Full of sound and fury, signifying absolutely nothing, End of Days is the loudest and least of the year's end-of-the-world movies."
End of Days,5.7,66889043,30,"I do have one overpowering Y2K fear: that Hollywood will keep belching out movies as excruciatingly dull, brutal, mindless and overlong as End of Days."
End of Days,5.7,66889043,30,"We're treated to such a broad panoply of godawful dialogue, righteously shoddy acting, and, worst of all for an action blockbuster of this sort, subpar effects work, that's it's all you can do not to giggle helplessly."
Looper,7.4,66486205,100,"So what's left for the audience to hook into? Only pounding action, elegant style, steady-state suspense, marvelous acting and, despite that droll pooh-poohing every now and then, haunting explorations of youth, age and personal destiny. It's a lot to claim for a sci-fi thriller, but I was blown away by Rian Johnson's Looper."
Looper,7.4,66486205,100,"Looper is a tremendous motion picture experience. Not merely a ""very good"" one, but a great one."
Looper,7.4,66486205,100,"Intelligent science-fiction sometimes seems an endangered species - too much physics and there's a risk of creating something cold and remote, too many explosions and get lost in the multiplex. Looper isn't perfect, but it pulls off the full Wizard Of Oz: it has a brain, courage and a heart."
Looper,7.4,66486205,100,"Director Rian Johnson's resulting film, a cornfield neo-noir, is the coolest, most-confident sci-fi flick since 2006's ""Children of Men."""
Looper,7.4,66486205,100,"The best sci-fi movie since ""Moon."" The best time-travel yarn since ""12 Monkeys."" And one of the best films of 2012. You'll immediately want to see it again."
Looper,7.4,66486205,91,"Looper is a remarkable feat of imagination and execution, entertaining from start to finish, even as it asks the audience to contemplate how and why humanity keeps making the same rotten mistakes."
Looper,7.4,66486205,91,"Johnson keeps it simple, yet never stupid. Looper is a puzzle engaging your brain, rather than frying it, as one character describes the process. Obviously he has seen enough movies on the subject by 2024 to know how frustrating that is. This one plays fair with the fantasy."
Looper,7.4,66486205,90,"I'm not ready to proclaim Looper a sci-fi masterpiece just yet; let's let it sit awhile. But it's a lean, mean, smart, violent picture with a bit of Stanley Kubrick edge, fueled by the terrific Gordon-Levitt."
Looper,7.4,66486205,90,"This is a highflying, super-stylish science-fiction thriller that brings a fresh approach to mind-bending genre material. We're not always sure where this time-travel film is going, but we wouldn't dream of abandoning the ride."
Looper,7.4,66486205,90,"Looper may not have the bell-ringing resonance of Chris Marker's ""La Jetée,"" one of its touchstones, but it's a jaunty match-up of genre and character drama that's far smarter and more finely wrought than almost anything else in the multiplexes."
Looper,7.4,66486205,90,"Looper makes a full-meal entertainment out of piecemealing genres: It boasts the kicky mental gymnastics that come with time-travel terrain, the relentless rapid heart rate of a crackerjack thriller, and the bursts of extreme violence, buttressed with black humor, of a modern actioner."
Looper,7.4,66486205,89,"This is an exciting, exceptionally well-made futuristic thriller that also happens to be loaded with lived-in touches and punchy ideas."
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,"Thanks to the assured hold Johnson exerts over this ingeniously structured game of cat-and-cat, we'll go anyplace he has in mind."
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,"An indie-inflected popcorn movie with major brains, brilliant acting and a highly satisfying payoff, Looper is the first must-see movie of the season."
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,"When so much of what Hollywood churns out is almost instantly forgettable, it says a lot about a film when viewers want to take time to argue, ponder and puzzle over it."
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,"Lacing tremendously exciting action with touching gravity, Looper hits you like a shot in the heart."
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,"Late in Looper, when a highly telekinetic kid starts levitating things, it really does look like Christopher Nolan had wandered onto the set and taken over."
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,"The leads blend as seamlessly as any young-old character coupling I've seen. The prosthetically altered Gordon-Levitt, unrecognizable at first, really resembles Willis."
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,This film leads to a startling conclusion that wipes out the story's paradoxes so neatly it's as if it never happened. You have to grin at the ingenuity of Johnson's screenplay.
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,"As in the very best Anthony Mann and John Ford westerns, Looper at once understands the visual power of violence and is deeply critical of it."
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,"While the third act inevitably bogs down a bit in gunplay and chases, there are more than enough moments of visual wonder and storytelling surprise to make it worth the trip."
Looper,7.4,66486205,83,"The time swivels in Looper evoke some of Inception's fancy temporal tricks... But it's the glimpses of Children of Men-like societal dystopia that give the movie its real weight, and distinguish Johnson's third feature as a marked step forward."
Looper,7.4,66486205,83,Perhaps the most thrilling thing about Looper is watching Johnson really grow leaps and bounds as a filmmaker.
Looper,7.4,66486205,83,"A fanciful film with the patina of hyper-realism, Looper is well served by actors who behave not as if they were dropped carelessly into the future but spent their whole desperate lives there."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"Gordon-Levitt is flinty, and Willis, on his A-game, is fiery. Together, they take us on a helluva trip."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"Gordon-Levitt has been so terrific for a while now that he's become a magnetic presence; Willis is also on a nice streak, not as strong here as in ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" but still quite good."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"Thrilling in its deft juggling of complex narrative elements, utterly clear in its presentation, and unfolding with what feels like serious moral purpose, Looper still can't help but suggest that its larger ambitions are something of a put-on, a nice thematic polish to set off its interpersonal drama."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"As time-travel action films go, here's one that's brainy, stylish and carries itself with B-flick modesty - all of which feels like some kind of alchemy."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"If high-toned futuristic time-travel pictures with a splash of romance float your boat the way they do mine, you'll have yourself a time."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"Their physical disparity notwithstanding, Gordon-Levitt and Willis both come across strongly, while Blunt effectively reveals Sara's tough and vulnerable sides."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"In a genre infamous for loose ends, this thinking man's thriller marshals action, romance and a dose of very dark comedy toward a stunning payoff."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"Once you commit to the lexicon – to the blunderbusses, the silver, the loops that close and the loops let run – you're in for a breathless ride. It's been a patchy summer for sci-fi, absent of anything that really sticks in the mind. Johnson's deep, distinctive film plays on repeat."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"My favorite line in the movie comes when Gordon-Levitt, in a face-off with his mob boss (Jeff Daniels), informs him that he'd like to leave the business one day and move to France, to which Daniels replies: ""I'm from the future; you should go to China."""
Looper,7.4,66486205,75,"Looper, a cocky sci-fi tale with more brass than substance, is rife with these ""Say what?"" moments."
Looper,7.4,66486205,75,"Looper ups the ante like a poker player on speed. What a potpourri of genres we have here – noir again, but sci-fi too, and action and horror and psycho-drama with existential trimmings, the latter designed to invite the thinking viewer into the fray."
Looper,7.4,66486205,75,"The casting is carefully considered, as well, from Willis, whose Old Joe is even more dangerous than Young Joe, to Emily Blunt, who goes American this time and plays a young mother with a winning warmth and vulnerability."
Looper,7.4,66486205,75,"With Looper, Johnson proves he can finesse the most complicated notions and visual setups his mind can imagine. It's the simple things that still elude him."
Looper,7.4,66486205,75,"While Looper lacks the heft of a classic, this wayback machine is worth taking for a spin."
Looper,7.4,66486205,75,"For about an hour Looper really cooks. Its second half is more of a medium boil, and less fun. But watching it, I realized how few commercial entertainments hold up straight through to the end-point."
Looper,7.4,66486205,75,"There's a adrenaline rush even in the problematic finish, an eagerness that drives the filmmaking so that Looper is thrilling to watch even when it falls apart."
Looper,7.4,66486205,75,"Mr. Johnson throws a lot at the screen, blasted corpses included, yet little here is as initially transfixing as Mr. Gordon-Levitt's mug."
Looper,7.4,66486205,70,"The resulting slowdown, as well as a significant narrative shift, gives Looper a slightly sprawling and ungrounded feel at times, almost as if the first and second halves are two separate movies."
Looper,7.4,66486205,60,"Looper felt to me like a maddening near-miss: It posits an impossible but fascinating-to-imagine relationship...and then throws away nearly all the dramatic potential that relationship offers. If someone remakes Looper as the movie it could have been in, say, 30 years, will someone from the future please FedEx it back to me?"
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,80,"In a summer of high-octane action and testosterone-boosted thrills, this movie is out of its league."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,63,"The concept is high but everything else is merely fair to middling, one more or less watchable B-movie in megabucks clothing."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,63,"Robinson's script is alive to the material's literary roots, although there is a sense that the brakes have been applied so as not to push into territory perceived as too esoteric for American teenagers."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,60,"The filmmakers tried to give everyone a main storyline and ended up diluting everything. With so many characters, the film lost some focus."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,60,"It depicts the world of a century ago in a way that comments on the anxieties facing the world today, and it does so, at least for a while, with cleverness and a sense of fun."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,50,"Here, finally, is a superhero movie your AP English teacher can enjoy."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,50,"The movie is based on a 1999 series of comic books by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, but the original tone of deadpan historical audacity has been replaced by a kind of wax-museum literalness."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,42,"The film wears out its welcome by the halfway mark, becoming a silly spectacle."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,42,"One more bloated effects-o-rama lumbering through a formula plot (super-villain out to rule the world) without much zest, imagination or awareness of its own absurdity."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,42,"Simply put, its too much of a good thing, this unreined tumult of chaos."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,40,"Moore invested his characters with flaws, with a tangible humanity; God knows they never felt the need to explain themselves, as the film does, rendering it something akin to one long footnote."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,40,The irony of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is that it has the most literate pedigree of any action movie you're likely to see this year or next -- and it's been made by people who seem to have no sense of how to tell a story.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,40,These guys have dumbed down a comic book.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,40,"League begins as a smart variation on the summer blockbuster, then loses its nerve in a second half sure to satisfy neither cheap-thrill-seekers nor fans of neglected literary oddities."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,40,"Has the sweat stains of wasted energy; it's dreary, yet frantic."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,40,How does an embarrassment of riches turn into mere embarrassment?
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,38,Outrageously vapid and overdone movie.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,38,"Having these characters interact is both the joke and raison d'etre of ""League."" Its story is beyond banal."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,38,Has the distinction of being much dumber and pulpier than the comic book on which it's based -- the ink practically comes off on your fingers as you watch it.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,38,What a riveting movie The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen might have been! And what a rickety mess it turned out to be when the people responsible lost faith in the origin of the material!
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,38,The murkiest-looking movie since Ben Affleck's Daredevil and about as lacking in charm.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,38,"Despite its preposterous leaps of logic, it somehow still emerges a reasonably entertaining summer blockbuster."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,38,It just doesn't work...This isn't a blend of modern and classic so much as a collision.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,30,And you wait--and wait--for the magic of movies.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,30,"Nothing anchors the lighter-than-air story as it drifts away under the direction of Stephen Norrington (""Blade"") into an FX stratosphere where wit, character and vigorous storytelling cease to matter."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,30,"Except for Connery, who is every inch the lion in winter, nothing here feels authentic."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,25,"Just when it seems about to become a real corker of an adventure movie, plunges into incomprehensible action, idiotic dialogue, inexplicable motivations, causes without effects, effects without causes, and general lunacy. What a mess."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,25,"Opium- addicted Allan Quatermain becomes none other than Sean Connery. At least he gives a real movie-star performance, which is more than the other gentlemen manage. Extraordinary? Balderdash!"
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,25,Bloated and incoherent.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,20,Extraordinary is the very last adjective that comes to mind.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,20,"A stiff. I don't know the comic book series, but it could hardly be as lifeless as this leaden adaptation, in which the weapons have more personality than the characters and the nonstop action often feels like no action at all."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,20,"Even if, per Wilde, all art is quite useless, it need not be quite as useless as this."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,20,Six guys and a gal who flatline on arrival. Easily the lamest action-adventure fantasy since Wild Wild West.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,12,Unfathomable balderdash.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,12,"It's not brazenly bad or heroically bad or stridently bad. It's bad in all the old, dull ways of being bad: poor performances, absurd story, dreary special effects, witless dialogue and the excessive length of someone taking himself far too seriously."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,58,"Maybe that call will be answered next time with enough incremental improvements to finally notch a good Divergent movie, a possibility Allegiant raises repeatedly and frustratingly. Ultimately, though, this movie isn’t just adhering to a formula; it’s carefully following a recipe designed to offset any good ingredients that get mixed in there by mistake."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,56,"“Allegiant” ends up feeling like a mid-season climax to serialized TV drama. The pieces are in play, the wheels in motion. Stay tuned, loyal viewers, and you’ll get your answers next year."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"The special effects are among the more positive aspects of “Allegiant,” but those alone cannot rescue this highly flawed sequel."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,Allegiant tries to cram too little story into too much time. This results in dead spots and uneven pacing.
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"Director Robert Schwentke and his writing team do their best to move things along.
Actually, who knows if it's their best? Maybe they're suffering from Divergent fatigue along with the rest of us."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"Allegiant aches to be a thought-provoking, moving allegory of the current world. Instead, it’s an unwieldy two hours too unintentionally silly to validate how seriously it takes itself."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"Because the series' plot reveal turns out to be more confusing than compelling, and because turning a novel into two films invariably leads to inflated productions, only the most devoted fans of the book will pledge allegiance to what's on the screen."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"Combines the usual dumb ideas with one good one. And not just good, but impressive, in that it makes sense of much of what went before."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"This doesn’t even feel much like Tris’s story anymore, just generically overdigitized combat. The main thing she’s diverging from at this point is the tone that hooked us in the first place."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"The film moves jerkily, in fits and starts, squandering its promising setup and bogging down in explanation."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Let's just call ""Allegiant"" what it is: A way for the studio to make money and bring you back next year for the real finale. See you then. Maybe."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,The only thing that's revolting is how dull the series has gotten.
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"This over-extended teen dystopia is treading water, coming up short on its trademark punchy plotting, teen self-discovery and the wonderful Woodley."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Big but boring, expansive but cheap-looking, Allegiant spins in place, waiting for next year’s Ascendent to come along and offer resolution. In all candour: you can do without it."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Like the earlier Divergent films, Allegiant is studded with enticing science-fiction ideas, but it keeps such a poker-straight face while presenting them, you often can’t help but crack up."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Instead of bringing much-needed clarity, Allegiant piles on yet more bamboozling mythology to flummox and confound."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Long, shiny, and treading a lot of water."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"It all leads to a climax so staggeringly lazy and glib that you honestly expect Woodley just to turn to the camera in the final scene, shrug her shoulders and walk off."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"For a film that takes great pride in its heroine's nonconformism, pretty much everything in Allegiant feels conventional."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Although “Allegiant” does recapture the original film’s sense of constantly discovering and adapting to fresh information, audiences no longer identify with anyone in particular."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,38,"As tedious as much of this sounds, an odd thing happened around “Allegiant’s” midway point. The fairly packed audience started vocally reacting “Rocky Horror”-style to some of the more overtly melodramatic turns with “oohs,"" “ahhs” and even laughter."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,38,"All of it feels warmed over, reprocessed … and, yes, confused."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,38,"It's a pretty dull picture, I must say, because it's my duty to say it. And it's a pretty dull picture, I must say, because something about its particular grade of dullness may cause memory loss."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,37,Everything is needlessly tangled and bewildering.
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,33,"Above all of the tiresome, poorly constructed mythology, nonexistent stakes, and presentation of subtext as text, Allegiant’s greatest sin is its total contempt for its viewers."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,30,"Three films into the ongoing Divergent series, one would hope we’d moved beyond laying plates and folding napkins to get to something more substantial. Yet Allegiant barely makes it to the appetizer course."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,30,"The actors still give it their all in Allegiant, but there's only so much they can do with such a clunky, verbose script. And on the rare occasion that the film actually quiets its characters down and delivers something resembling action, it's woefully inert."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,30,A story that kicked off two years ago at a reasonable gallop has now slowed to barely a limp.
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,25,"If only their stuff had a spark of life it might be forgivable, but Allegiant plods along like a franchise on its last legs. Who remembers where we left off last time in Insurgent? My point exactly — no one."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,25,"Try as I might, I cannnot activate your interest in this bloated excuse for a movie."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,25,"The pleasures of Allegiant are unintended, those little bits of business taken so seriously that serious viewers must laugh."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,25,"This sort of movie really should be about more than meekly obvious names for human traits separated into tribes, the future tech, the dystopian landscape, the fashions, the hair styles...But there isn’t a line that lands, a scene that sticks with you, an emotion you feel or a moment this movie drags you to the edge of your seat."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,0,"By the time David gets someone to unleash the gas, I was wishing he could simply erase all memories of the sorry “Divergent’’ franchise."
Smokey and the Bandit II,5.2,66132626,70,"The screenplay, by Jerry Belson and Brock Yates, is not so surreally funny as the one for the first film, but funny lines are not what the picture is about. Smokey and the Bandit II is about movement, action, frustration and destruction, and Mr. Needham, one of Hollywood's most successful stunt artists before he became a director, is very good at this sort of thing. Smokey and the Bandit is entertaining in a brainless way."
Smokey and the Bandit II,5.2,66132626,63,"Three years after Smokey and the Bandit took the hard-drinking, fast-driving, trickster ethos of the American redneck into the big box-office league, Reynolds has proved he just does what he does best: show off. A lightweight chase caper that Reynolds must truly be sick of by now, but which he has elevated into something impossible to dislike."
Smokey and the Bandit II,5.2,66132626,60,"Sally Field tells Burt Reynolds in Smokey and the Bandit II that he is no longer having fun doing what used to come naturally. This stale sequel seems to be evidence of going through the motions for money instead of fun. Ironically, the best part of the film is the unusual end credit sequence, which shows the actors having fun when they blow lines in outtakes."
Smokey and the Bandit II,5.2,66132626,40,"There is no need for this movie. That's true of most sequels, but it's especially true of Smokey and the Bandit II, which is basically just the original movie done again, not as well."
Smokey and the Bandit II,5.2,66132626,25,"Smokey and the Bandit II -- is a premeditated embarrassment. It seems to prove that entertainers who discover a successful formula may not have the foggiest notion of how to protect, duplicate and sustain it."
Smokey and the Bandit II,5.2,66132626,25,So unimaginative that it's more of a remake than a sequel. Reynolds and his buddies all act as if they're in a home movie as they rehash the same tired gags and dull chases that filled the original.
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,88,"A slick, scary, funny Creature Feature, beautifully photographed and splendidly acted in high adventure style."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,75,"Coil up with a tub of popcorn, get a stranglehold on your soda - this is a creepy, action-packed boat ride down a jungle river with lots of huge snakes dropping by for man-sized snacks."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,75,A trashily entertaining reptilian version of ''Jaws'' set in the steaming heart of the Amazon rain forest.
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,70,"Voight's performance -- one of the film's pure, trashy delights -- is all leer, sneer and macho swagger, while the rest of the actors feel like the disposable snake-fodder they are."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,67,"A silly and plodding ""Jaws"" rip-off about a 40-foot man-eating snake on the prowl in the Brazilian rain forest."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,50,"The biggest flaw can be summed up in a short phrase: lack of excitement. Thrillers are supposed to be crammed with thrills (hence the name), but Anaconda is relatively barren of them."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,50,"Feels like ""Alien"" as directed by Jim Henson. And the suspense is restricted to mundane slasher-movie tactics, including the frequent use of a mobile camera (call it the condacam) thats supposed to represent the snakes point of view."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,50,"Jon Voight, the all-purpose villain, does a pretty good job of imitating Marlon Brando imitating a Paraguayan snake expert, but the rest of the players--including Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Eric Stoltz, Owen Wilson, Vincent Castellanos, Jonathan Hyde, and Kari Wuhrer--seem to be in a hurry to pick up their checks."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,40,"The movie provides a fair number of laughs, even if you can't help wondering how many of them were actually intentional."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,40,"In what is surely a tribute to the dazzling mediocrity of director Luis Llosa, the real jungle looks as bland as the fake jungle."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,40,Mr. Whipple squeezing his Charmin is scarier than this phony baloney computer effects-driven anaconda.
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,38,"Quite unintentionally, director Luis Llosa and screenwriters Hans Bauer, Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. have crafted a howler; Anaconda, meant to be a nail-biting thriller, is a laugh-out-loud comedy."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,30,Such a classic combination of feckless dramaturgy and rampant excess that giving way to giggles is the only sane response.
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,30,"Although it's refreshing to see an action movie that doesn't pretend to be something it isn't, this frankness has a downside, because what the picture so unapologetically is isn't, in fact, much."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,30,"So desperate and silly that here and there, it's a lot of fun."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,30,"Charmless, unfrightening, and even devoid of the requisite gratuitous nudity, Anaconda just plain bites."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,25,"This film marks for Jon Voigt a concerted effort to unseat Christopher Walken in the competition for the Czarship of sneering, wheezing, Machiavellian, all-around weird guys. He spends much of his time standing around making a face like Beavis does when he's really freaked out."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,20,"If only director Luis Llosa and his cast could see the joke and seize upon it; instead, like its computer-morphed snake, the film doesn't have a clever bone in its body."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,70,The car chases are unimpeachable.
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,67,"With more sophisticated writing, one suspects they could really soar: Even here, slowed by clunky, character-establishing lines and an all-devouring plot, they hit more often than they miss."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,63,"But the bad boys achieve something a budget can't buy: an easy, natural rapport that makes you root for them. For comedy and thrills, Lawrence and Smith are a dream team."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,63,"We've seen it all a million times before, but there are abundant (foul-mouthed) funnies, and debut director Michael Bay shows his commercials expertise propelling the noisy nonsense into a frantically slick and thoroughly enjoyable extravaganza."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,63,"Crucially, the teaming of standup favorite and ""Martin"" star Lawrence and ""Fresh Prince"" Smith clicks from the outset, with both right at home handling action and comedy on the bigscreen. Even when it's not particularly funny, their interplay is engaging, and their lively, raucous personalities keep the proceedings punchy and watchable for the slightly overlong running time."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,60,"Would have been better if it had been sleeker and shorter. After all, this film isn't aiming for high-toned drama, just high-energy entertainment, which is what it delivers."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,60,"The flabbergasting scenes here-written by a team of ""Tonight Show"" and ""David Letterman Show"" writers and directed by hot, young TV-commercial and music-video director Michael Bay-are slick, fast, loud, mostly derived from other movies and often senseless."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,60,Whom do they make these movies for? What exercise in self-deception inspires them to go to such effort and expense for what is obviously going to be a lame exercise in retreadmanship?
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"Aside from the racial twist, this is pretty conventional fare, but it's consistently diverting."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"Though audiences will leave theaters with an increased appreciation of this pair's talents, they will also leave pondering the perennial Hollywood question: How come so little of interest could be found for performers who are capable of so much more?"
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"Benefits from Smith and Lawrence's chemistry. As long as they're on screen together, things breeze along. But when they're apart, the movie flounders."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"There's only so far a movie can go on loud music, nicely-framed shots, testosterone, and adrenaline. Bad Boys takes the often-traveled road, and leads the audience to a dead end."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,It's like a series of cliches exploding in your face.
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"Even by the low-low standards of cheap action flicks, this one's bad, boys."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"From the swooping aerial shots of downtown Miami, to the long, long-legged beauties that seem to crop up every time the action threatens to slow down, to the nonsensical lack of logic that permeates the film like the acrid odor of wasted cordite, Bad Boys oozes Eighties Hollywood clichés like no film since ""Top Gun."""
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"Relentless formulaic fodder for the explosion-starved; it's loud, shallow, sexist and a complete waste of time."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,42,Formulaic sass machine... I was writhing in my seat.
Stakeout,6.6,65673233,100,"Delivers excitement, humor and good nature. The director uses the conventions of the action-comedy in so adroit a way that you may even forget the hundred other films you've seen lately about a couple of cops kidding around with each other in between battling the bad guys."
Stakeout,6.6,65673233,90,"StakeOut is a slick, sure-footed entertainment, one part buddy comedy and one part police actioner stitched together with a dash of romance."
Stakeout,6.6,65673233,80,A mature human farce that values characters' foibles over their firearms.
Stakeout,6.6,65673233,80,"Stakeout is an example of a movie that would have been a lot better if the filmmakers had been prepared to trust the human dimensions of their characters - to follow these people where their personalities led. Instead, Badham takes out an insurance policy by adding the assembly-line violence."
Stakeout,6.6,65673233,75,"This movie marked a virtuoso return for Dreyfuss, who is captivating in his role."
Stakeout,6.6,65673233,75,"Between Lecce's illicit courtship and Reimers' consternation, there are some hearty laughs of a juvenile nature."
Stakeout,6.6,65673233,75,A diverting cops-comedy-cum-action-romance.
Stakeout,6.6,65673233,70,"A comic take on Rear Window, Badham's latest has the acting talent to carry it over the sizeable gulfs in plot to an end product that brings laughs aplenty."
Stakeout,6.6,65673233,70,Stakeout is this summer's suntan lotion: It won't linger in the memory any better than it would survive a quick dip in the pool.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,75,"In a summer where the special effects in movies have grown steadily more repetitive and dreary, ""LCTR:TCOL"" uses imagination and exciting locations to give the movie the same kind of pulp adventure feeling we get from the Indiana Jones movies."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,70,"Angelina Jolie focuses her wild energy into outlandish heroics, and emerges with more attractiveness and credibility than all three of those silly Charlie's Angels combined."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,63,Somewhat fleeter and more engaging than its predecessor.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,63,"Jolie is even hotter, faster and more commanding than last time around as the fearless heiress/adventuress, plus a little more human. The less welcome news is that most of the same shortcomings that cramped the first installment are still dogging the sequel, which delivers on action but dawdles through downtime."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,60,"However caricatured a vision of female empowerment, Lara Croft exercises an irresistible tug not just on the adolescent male imagination but the 12-year-old female imagination as well."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,60,"This Indiana Jones knockoff goes down smoothly enough, and Jolie isn't bad at all, though every time she opened her mouth I expected Mick Jagger to come dancing down her tongue."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,60,Enough goodwill has been built up in the early sections that most viewers will not take offense when the movie abandons its plot and characters.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,60,Croft is one humorless butt-kicker. Excavations in exotic lands have rarely looked so much like items on a to-do list.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,58,"Its not half bad, with cool locations and a great stunt leap from the top of a Hong Kong high-rise."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"Superior to 2001's ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" in almost every way. It's better directed, more consistently acted, and its writing, while at times ridiculous, at least has a modicum of logic at its core. I still had to slap myself to stay awake."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"A creditable genre entry, the rare action movie with a discernible story, an assured pace and a charismatic central character. It falls apart in the end."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"Even though the special effects and action sequences are good, the monsters conjured up are rather humdrum."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"Bombastic it may be, but its rarely boring, as was the first Tomb Raider. Keep your expectations in line with the source material and you may be pleasantly surprised."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"This is a highly enjoyable summer thrill ride with an action heroine who likes to be on top, literally and figuratively."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,Even sex can't save a film that produces instant narcolepsy.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"If only the love story were a little more convincing, she might have saved the world and the movie."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"Isn't nearly as much fun as the original. For one thing, Lara having a boyfriend wrecks everything."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,Emerges as just one more formulaic action film as the title character bounces around the globe in a deadly treasure hunt.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"Offers plenty of eye candy, if little else. Ultimately, the film is clearly superior to its predecessor, but that's mostly because the first Tomb Raider left so much room for improvement."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"Its faults -- banal dialogue, ludicrous and uninspired plotting, dull but vicious fight scenes -- make you realize just how much the summer action movie has declined in the last few years."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,Simply a series of set pieces designed to insure Angelina Jolie's status as action-babe pin-up.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"The movie is all action. But there's no pacing, no suspense and no vulnerability for the protagonist so it all soon gets numbingly tiresome."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"Even in the final battle over life and death, the only injury she suffers is a slight scratch on the face. Its too much like a video game."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"Quite simply, the ""Tomb Raider"" series has been flat-out boring, even with the talented and fun Jolie -- who needs to take off those harnesses and get back to real movies. She deserves better."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,42,Beneath its satisfactory chops this movie -- like Ms. Croft herself -- is stuffy and soulless.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,40,"With her bulging blue eyes, elaborately braided hair and slinky spandex costumes, she's an indelible icon of action-heroine chic, and, quite frankly, the films don't deserve her."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,40,"Competent in the extreme, the talented Jolie would make a great Jane Bond. But mired in this joyless orgy of preposterousness, her biggest challenge is simply keeping a straight face."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,38,"If ever there was a movie fit for permanent entombment, it's this sequel."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,30,"In a summer of surprisingly self-serious comic book movies"" Lara Croft ""stands out as being particularly humorless."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,30,Cradle of lifelessness.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,25,"Another joyless, brain-numbing adventure through lackluster Indiana Jones territory."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,25,"The worst action movie of the summer. I liked Bad Boys II a little less, but making the comparison is like distinguishing between a cow turd and a horse turd. And that pretty much sums it up nicely."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,25,It wouldn't be fair to gripe about the hundreds of plot holes; the whole thing is hole.

Even when you don't really believe them, they're always a lot of fun to watch."

The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,75,"Has all the usual virtues of a good action suspense drama, but it lacks that extra something - that context, that vital interchange - that made the original ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" such a memorable experience in 1974."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,75,"Tony Scott pushes all the right buttons, crafting a worthy -- and in many ways, a superior -- update."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,70,So professionally done you rarely have the luxury of taking your eyes off the screen.
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,67,"The film is thus more of a technical showcase than a human drama. It's diverting enough until it gets dumb, but so strong from the start is the certainty that dumb is on the way that you can't get too vexed when it finally arrives."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,67,"Whereas the original, directed by Joseph Sargent, was essentially a well-oiled B movie, the new incarnation, directed by Tony (""Enemy of the State"") Scott, is bristling with high-tech gimcrackery and over-the-top camera flourishes."

The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,63,"By itself, the new ""Pelham"" is a solid, suspenseful tale all over again, so long as it stays in the subway tunnels and airless offices of the transit department."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,63,"Washington offers another of his rock-steady performances, playing a career civil servant with a couple of secrets of his own, but confident, diligent, ready to go the distance for the city he loves."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,60,"Curiously, despite the ever-energetic Tony Scott at the throttle, the sleek new edition isn't as transporting as it should have been."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,60,"If Hollywood is going to remake a '70s movie, it might as well be Pelham, and it ought to work as competently as this one. But wouldn't it be nice, once in a while, for Hollywood to turn contemporary traumas into vigorous movies instead of hijacking the anxieties of the past?"
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,50,Watching this Pelham--a money job from its conception--you can believe that there's no other motivation on Earth.
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,50,"Scott's redo comes up short in almost every regard against the '74 model--against David Shire's knuckled-brass score, against its mugs' gallery of '70s New York character actors, against Peter Stone's serrated script, and certainly against its wordless punchline."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,50,Just plain silly.

Battleship,5.8,65422625,83,"Battleship is a sound vessel floating in Hollywood's oil-slick sea of ""Transformers"" sequels and vampire riffs."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,75,An invigorating blast of cinematic adrenaline.
Battleship,5.8,65422625,70,"Here's an audacious, inventive and character-driven blockbuster with some wit sprinkled in for good measure. It's fun, and filled with a surprising degree of intrigue and suspense."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,70,"And when the F-14s came out for a triumphant flyover, I looked around the room to find the moron who was applauding only to realize that it was me."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,63,"The nicest touch is that Battleship has an honest-to-God third act, instead of just settling for nonstop fireballs and explosions, as Bay likes to do. I don't want to spoil it for you. Let's say the Greatest Generation still has the right stuff and leave it at that."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,60,One of the more enjoyably terrible movies of the year.
Battleship,5.8,65422625,60,"It's no ""Das Boot,"" but Battleship is a boatload of popcorny fun."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,60,"The movie drags on way too long, but there are things to like."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,60,"Those looking for big, loud sci-fi action will find plenty to like here as director Peter Berg (Hancock, Friday Night Lights) pumps up the volume on clashing military hardware and flag-waving heroics."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,55,"Actually, the picture is perhaps not quite as painful as you might be expecting, though probably not as enjoyable, either."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"The story, by brothers Erich and Jon Hoeber, who also penned the clever, quippy, aging-assassin movie ""Red,"" is cleverer and quippier than it has any reason to be, even if it makes not the remotest sense."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"Proficient director Peter Berg (""Hancock"") keeps the noise so deafening we can't think about how preposterous it all is."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"Battleship has its moments, like the rare occasions when it nods to its origin: There's a nice eureka when we learn that evil alien ships can be outwitted, improbably, by plotting co-ordinates on a grid, à la your granddad's board game."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"Battleship is dopey, preposterous and unintentionally hilarious in all the wrong places, but as directed by Peter Berg, it is also energetic, fast-moving and bracing."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"This may sound thrilling, but it's not.  Battleship plays ordinary and pedestrian because it's always been a job for hire, never anyone's passion."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"Has a plot as unambitious as a macaroni dinner, familiar and easy to eat and not particularly nutritious."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"Like ""Transformers,"" which it rivals in relentlessness, Battleship comes with its own force field, a furious energy that renders criticism irrelevant."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"Mostly, Battleship is a noisy, overlong and numbing military-vs.-aliens saga with laughably bad dialogue."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"Once the special effects take over, Berg has little room to assert his personality (or tell a story, for that matter), and the movie feels like a chore."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"Overlong and underwritten even by the standards of summer f/x extravaganzas, this Battleship will nonetheless float with many on the strength of its boyish, eager-to-please razzle-dazzle."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,42,"Despite some promising early goofiness involving full-contact soccer and the quest for a chicken burrito, Battleship plays it regrettably straight most of the time, as if the fate of the world really might rest on how well the Navy can hurtle projectiles at alien warships. With eyes closed, the movie uncannily resembles a giant baby playing with pots and pans."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,40,This is the kind of summer movie that softens your brain tissue without even providing the endocrine burst of pleasure that would make it all worthwhile.
Battleship,5.8,65422625,40,"Its shameless and nonsensical combination of ingredients finally won me over, after a fashion, when I realized that its gung-ho Navy-recruitment propaganda and retrograde gender politics shouldn't be taken any more seriously than the ZZ Top, AC/DC and Billy Squier songs on the soundtrack."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,40,"What's the word on the film debut of Rihanna, playing a sass-mouthed petty officer? Dreadful (ella, ella)."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,40,Miss.
Battleship,5.8,65422625,40,Misguided in the extreme. A scene in which Kitsch and co aim blindly for the broadest of targets – and miss by miles – proves painfully apt.
Battleship,5.8,65422625,38,"It makes ""Top Gun"" look like the work of Orson Welles. At least the Tom Cruise movie remembered to cast actual actors."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,38,"If only there were more genuine rah-rah fun involved, instead of just endless, thudding, seen-it-all-before mayhem."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,38,"Battleship has the IQ of a rutabaga and doesn't require much more intelligence than that to watch. Despite spending copious amounts of time with back story and so-called character development, it's really all about the explosions."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,33,"The script is replete with howlers. My favorite, from Kitsch, after the aliens strike: ""I've got a bad feeling about this."" Indeed."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,33,"There's almost nothing to Battleship beyond its grindingly dull, digitally rendered naval warfare."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,30,"This crass and hugely dumb aliens vs. multiple earthling navies should thrill the hyperactive 10-year-old inside you. Adults, on the other hand – and especially genre-fan adults – will be bored to tears and wishing Bay (or at least Jerry Bruckheimer) had something of their own on the marquee out front."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,30,"Its endless parade of explosions, battles and general mayhem makes Michael Bay seem like Ingmar Bergman in comparison with Battleship director Peter Berg."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,25,"Two flesh-and-blood performers stand out among the machinery. One is pop singer Rhianna, looking lovely as usual despite the military gear and quite comfortable with high-powered artillery. The other is Gregory D. Gadson, an Army veteran who lost his legs to a roadside bomb in Baghdad."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,25,"It's loud, it's large, it's stupid, and its best gag involves a chicken burrito."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,25,"Way to go, Battleship: Take the crassest of cynical junk, slather it in jingoism and sell it as rah-rah fun for right-wingers."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,25,"Battleship is a board game for children, so it stands to reason a film adaptation would also be aimed at kids. But did they have to gear it to really dumb kids?"
Battleship,5.8,65422625,25,"Shamelessly mimics Michael Bay's larger-than-life dialogue, sweeping cinematography, cornball romance, and military fetishism."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,0,The worst humans-fighting-aliens movie I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot of humans-fighting-aliens movies.
Lethal Weapon,7.6,65207127,100,"For his first produced screenplay, Black took the best clichés from his favorite movies and honed them until they cut. Lethal Weapon’s heroes were edgier. And thanks in large part to the all-in commitment of director Richard Donner and producer Joel Silver, its chases and shoot-outs were more destructive. This one modestly budgeted genre exercise pumped hot blood back into a stiffening body."
Lethal Weapon,7.6,65207127,100,"In a movie with the energy of this one, we're exhilarated by the sheer freedom of movement; the violence becomes surrealistic and less important than the movie's underlying energy level."
Lethal Weapon,7.6,65207127,90,"Lethal Weapon opens with a shot of Mel Gibson in his birthday suit and just gets better. Likewise we meet costar Danny Glover in the bathtub, fêted by his family on his 50th birthday. This endearing double exposure introduces us to the vulnerabilities of these superduper heroes, an odd couple of cops who mature into friends as they quell crime."
Lethal Weapon,7.6,65207127,90,"After watching Gibson and Glover grow accustomed to each other, develop trust and confidence in each other and charge bullheadedly into dangerous situations, you can't help but hope there's a ""Lethal Weapon II."" It would be one of the few times a sequel would make sense and dollars."
Lethal Weapon,7.6,65207127,88,"This is one of the best of the subgenre, an action-packed movie that delivers adrenaline jolts with both barrels while not skimping on character development and wry humor."
Lethal Weapon,7.6,65207127,88,"Gibson is truly frightening as the cop about to go into orbit, and Glover is a standout as the down-to-earth lawman with very much to lose."
Lethal Weapon,7.6,65207127,88,"Stylish and brutally violent, the film escapes the usual clichés of the ex-soldier fighting a war back home by virtue of Gibson's blue-eyed smile."
Lethal Weapon,7.6,65207127,80,"The film is all fast action, noisy stunts and huge, often unflattering close-ups, but it packs an undeniable wallop."
Lethal Weapon,7.6,65207127,80,"The pace never slows, the jokes never miss and the stunts never disappoint in this macho-dream of an actioner."
Lethal Weapon,7.6,65207127,80,"Lethal Weapon is a film teetering on the brink of absurdity when it gets serious, but thanks to its unrelenting energy and insistent drive, it never quite falls."
Lethal Weapon,7.6,65207127,75,"The atmosphere, the buddy stuff and the flashy setting don't make up for the fact that the main story is too distanced throughout much of the movie. Further diluting the film's intensity is the scene structuring; far too often lame expository scenes serve to advance the plot or explain the backstory."
Lethal Weapon,7.6,65207127,75,"Unfortunately, director Richard Donner doesn't pay much attention to text, subtext, or anything else; his 1986 film is empty glitz in search of a style, with arbitrary action substituting for ordinary narrative coherence."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,80,"The heists are bigger, the illusions are flashier, and the pace is quicker. Even the cast is livelier and more fun. Perhaps best of all, the movie captures the first film’s twisty ability to twirl an audience around, so you’re never entirely sure what’s happened until everything is explained."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,80,"Now You See Me 2 is more like a giddy piece of cheese from the ’80s, a chance to spend two more hours with characters we like, doing variations on the things that made us like them in the first place. The revisit, in this case, is well-earned."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,80,"Director Jon M. Chu has a lighter touch than “Now You See Me” director Louis Leterrier. The latter’s “Transporter” pedigree made sure there was plenty of rugged action, but Chu’s résumé boasts “Jem and the Holograms,” “G.I. Joe: Retaliation,” and more than one film in the “Step Up” franchise. The man knows his cartoons, and that’s a good thing."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,75,"Working from a screenplay by Ed Solomon, director Jon M. Chu is more craftsman than poet, but the charismatic ensemble cast engages in the trickery with style."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,75,Now You See Me 2 gets giddy on its own unreality. That sense of freewheeling excess extends from the chip heist — set in a metal-free clean room — to the nonstop contrivances and coincidences to the cast.
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,75,"Jon M. Chu (several Step Up movies) has taken over directing duties from Louis Leterrier, and he has a lighter, goofier touch. He seems to get that the silliness is baked in."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,63,"In real life, of course, nobody can be hypnotized against their will. To be mesmerized is to willingly succumb. Just keep that in mind when you head off to see something like Now You See Me 2."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,63,"It's the magic of movies, not a movie that comes close to achieving real magic."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,63,"“2” is as flashy and splashy as the original. Both also register right up there on the implausibility scale — that’s like the Richter scale, only with head scratching — but “2” has a lighter touch and more interesting settings. Macau and London, here we come."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,63,"The film is, at times, almost sinfully fun, assuming you have a taste for self-indulgently logic-free hedonism."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,60,"Here's a movie that is far from perfect, far from seamless and far from unassailable. But it manages to be a fun diversion anyway -- and one that will likely leave audiences hungry for more."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"This time around, however, the magic has fizzled. Based solely on merit, Now You See Me 2 is a sequel that should never have been made."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"There's not much awe showcased here. The film is mainly horseplay, wasted motion, and talk, talk, talk, with a few good action scenes."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"Try to remember this movie, a few days after seeing it, and you’ll find that — like magic — it’s disappeared."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"There are some marginal but still noticeable stylistic improvements in the sequel. John M. Chu (a veteran of music videos and Justin Bieber: Never Say Never) brings a peppy energy that Louis Leterrier’s first film lacked, especially when showing off the flashy spectacle of the Horsemen’s almost-superheroic magic abilities."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,Your enjoyment of the movie will depend on whether you can suspend your disbelief — and confusion — and let the magic of misdirection wash over you.
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"Everything is supersized and preposterous, but Mr. Chu, with two films in the “Step Up” franchise under his belt, is undaunted by crowds and confusion."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"Thaddeus Bradley, narrating in tedious metaphors about how “there’s always more than what’s on the surface.” That’s one claim this shallow sequel simply can’t back up."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"Now You See Me 2 is more fun than ""Now You See Me,"" which says something, I guess. It fits snugly in the long list of easygoing nothings, the narrative equivalent of a Fruit Roll-Up, designed to be forgotten in as many minutes as they took to watch."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"If you fell for the 2013 original — and surprisingly, many did — then Now You See Me 2 has got your number. For the rest of us, however, this longer, louder sequel adds up to what one character calls ""a sack of nada."""
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"Doubling down on the giddily ridiculous tone of its predecessor, Now You See Me 2 is diverting, but the film’s rampant, cheeky cleverness — its ‘can you guess what’s going on?” coyness — ultimately proves tiresome."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"Compared with the first film, this one embraces the premise’s essential preposterousness, although not necessarily to winning effect."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,40,"Constructed to fool the viewer with layer upon layer of lame cheats and moth-eaten devices, the film has nothing on its mind but sinking you gently into an in-flight stupor."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,40,"It’s an impressively starry cast, but sadly, this lacks the charm, wit and, yes, magic of the original. You’ll like it, not a lot."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,40,"Now You See Me 2 is an essential example of how inessential movie sequels have become. It ignores what was good about the first film, abandons its defining characteristics, and tells a story nobody asked for."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,38,"That score — insistent, sexy, jazzy and loud — almost puts it over, letting us skim over the ways the laws of logic and physics are violated, the lack of charisma of these “charismatic” magicians, the works. Until the ending, where it all feels like a cheap cheat and a waste of two hours and nine minutes of your life."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,38,Sitting through the smug and convoluted and ridiculous Now You See Me 2 is like being subjected to a dunk tank again and again — and then being handed a wet towel when it’s finally over.
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,38,The sheer amount of people and incident indifferently presented throughout this film suggests only an obligation to quota-filling.
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,25,"Now You See Me 2 is a vapid, heartless film that wastes the time of its cast and audience alike."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,25,"For their next act, the illusionist con artists from Now You See Me will make every ounce of goodwill that movie earned disappear."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,20,Excruciatingly incoherent.
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,20,"The deal-breaking problem with these films – among so, so many problems – is this: They don’t f--king ground the magic in any sort of reality, but rely on CGI for their showstoppers."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,16,"We used to watch movies and wonder “How did they do that?” The problem with Now You See Me 2 isn’t that we already know the answer, it’s that we’re not even inspired to ask the question."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,100,"As a fictional, big-budget, 3-D, epic interpretation of Moses’ journey, Exodus: Gods and Kings is spectacular."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,90,"What’s remarkable about Scott’s genuinely imposing Old Testament psychodrama is the degree to which he succeeds in conjuring a mighty and momentous spectacle — one that, for sheer astonishment, rivals any of the lavish visions of ancient times the director has given us — while turning his own skepticism into a potent source of moral and dramatic conflict."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,80,"As spectacular and surprising as you would expect from Scott. Its spiritual uncertainty – and lack of triumphalism – perhaps robs it of a truly satisfying, cathartic conclusion, but also makes for a truly modern, thoughtful biblical blockbuster."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,80,Scott operates on a suitably Biblical scale and grounds the spectacle with rock-solid turns from Bale and Edgerton.
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,75,"It’s not a question of believing it, exactly. Director Ridley Scott has simply made us want to be there, to wish we really were there, and to accept his illusion as the most ready answer to that desire."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,75,"Is it possible to sit through a movie, mentally cataloging its absurdities, and still walk out dazzled? Because that pretty much sums up my experience watching Ridley Scott's eye-candy spectacle Exodus: Gods and Kings, an over-the-top Old Testament epic that's essentially Gladiator with God."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,75,"For all its stunning and stark wilderness settings (Spain and the Canary Islands), its stunning effects, technical proficiency and scriptural cleverness, Exodus is a chilly affair... It’s still an exciting, entertaining epic."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,70,"As uneven as Ridley Scott’s career; at times, it seems to be a journey through the director’s greatest strengths and weaknesses. The good news is that his strengths eventually win out; the bad news is all the awkward storytelling and botched character interactions we have to wade through to get to the good stuff. Once we do, though, Exodus is a hoot."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,67,"Exodus is an entertainment of the first order. I’m not so sure about the filmmaker’s decision to render the Metatron archangel as a 9-year-old boy, but what the hell? You get hit on the head with a boulder, who knows what you’ll see?"
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,63,"Scott’s “Exodus” is dutiful, deeply earnest, and more than a little dull."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,63,"How you respond to the totality of Exodus: Gods and Kings will, I suspect, relate directly to how you responded to Ridley Scott's ""Robin Hood"" from 2010. Square, a little heavy on its feet, much of that film held me, even when its bigness trumped its goodness. Same with this one."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,63,"In Exodus: Gods and Kings, Scott settles for sticking (mostly) to the Book, skipping the boring parts in order to dish out the razzle-dazzle. This is spectacular entertainment, practically a theme park ride, that could have used more spirituality and soul."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,63,"Exodus is a biblical epic that comes at you at maximum velocity but stays stirringly, inspiringly human."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,60,"Whilst the tone is off, and the talented cast wasted, Exodus is, at times highly entertaining, albeit unintentionally."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,60,"For all of the care and imagination that have been lavished on the production, which was designed by Arthur Max and photographed by Dariusz Wolski, the film’s impact is best expressed by frequent aerial shots that are visually impressive and emotionally remote."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,60,"As with the DeMille ventures, enjoyment here involves managing expectations and not taking things too seriously."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,60,"This is bold and uncompromising stuff from Scott; a Biblical epic to shake your faith in the order of things, not reaffirm it."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,60,"It is half turkey, half triumph."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,60,"No movie with such a limp ending can be fully satisfying, and the beginning also falters.  But the long middle section is a rousing good show."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,59,"Even with exhilarating plague montages and stomach-dropping illusions of scale amid the many battles, the characteristically brilliant shots for which the famed director is known can’t compensate for the completely tone-deaf overall result—so far removed from the days in which the filmmaker brought us Alien."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,58,"When we last see a much older Moses en route to Canaan, we can at least be grateful that this film, unlike so many other movies these days, does not seem primed for a sequel."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,50,"As for Bale, he seems to have lost his compass. His accent strays, his famous intensity wasted on clunky dialogue."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,50,"At 2 1/2 hours, the movie is actually too short to adequately tell the full tale (The Ten Commandments is 70 minutes longer) but that doesn't prevent Scott from presenting multiple, seemingly endless scenes of people crossing deserts."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,50,"Exodus is ludicrous only by accident, which isn’t much fun and is the surest sign of what we might call a New Testament sensibility at work. But the movie isn’t successfully serious, either... To be fair, there is some good stuff here, too. Mr. Scott is a sinewy storyteller and a connoisseur of big effects."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,50,A handsome movie with a handsome leading man. Christian Bale is widely considered the finest actor of his generation. Yet here he’s adrift in the bulrushes. This might be the most indifferent performance of Bale’s career.
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,50,"the performances, even from some really good actors, are wooden, the huge CGI effects are a distraction and the best thing about the movie is the one thing that, other than the casting, will probably make the most people angry: God is a kid."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,50,"Swarms of flies, oozing pustules, alligator attacks and gaggles of frogs are vividly rendered in three dimensions in Exodus: Gods and Kings. And yet this biblical epic is still bland, overly long and otherwise forgettable."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,50,"Scott loses the humanity amid all the gods and kings. The setpieces, however, elevate the film around them."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,50,"If nothing else, Exodus: Gods And Kings makes it easier to appreciate Darren Aronofsky’s ""Noah,"" which, for all of its flaws, was at least animated by a personal relationship to the Old Testament."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,50,"For a story that's pro-poor and anti-wealth, every frame of it looks like it cost as much as human life itself — and that, more than any bludgeoned battle cries for freedom, is the pleasure of the film."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,50,"Exodus: Gods and Kings illustrates a typical contradiction of commercial entertainment: By playing it safe, the movie fails to enrich the material, and never captures the energy that has made its narrative so captivating for millennia."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,47,"This stodgy adaptation creaks with solemnity — not to mention reactionary casting choices — and apart from some nifty frog and locust infestations, even the special effects pale next to a wind-blown Charlton Heston parting the Red Sea."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,42,"As an action spectacular, Exodus is on par with Scott's other forays into ancient times, ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven."" But as a believable human drama, much less a worthy exploration of Judaism's origins, it falls flat."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,42,"Exodus: Gods and Kings is a creaky, sometimes painfully boring Old Testament slog, and finds the visionary director unable to successfully wrangle a human story out of a tale of gods and kings."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,38,"A numbing and soulless spectacle of 3-D, computer-generated imagery run amok, Ridley Scott’s Exodus: Gods and Kings presents an enduring tale by pummeling us over the head with it."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,38,"While the pale skin tones (bronzer is selectively applied) and haphazard mix of American and British accents is distracting, it barely scratches the surface of Exodus’s ungainly artificiality."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,38,"It doesn't take long to realize that Ridley Scott's adaptation is only aiming for certain forms of credibility, and callously eschewing others."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,33,"This is that rare case where it feels like every choice Scott made was off, and the cumulative impact of all of these choices is one of the most crushing disappointments of the year in terms of who made the film and how little of it works."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,25,"This biblical action drama that feels excessive in every way imaginable, from running time (nearly 2 1/2  hours) to melodramatic acting to the conspicuous amount of computer generation."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,25,"An utterly clueless, relentlessly grim and rambling action epic guaranteed to displease devout Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, amuse atheists — and generally bore everyone."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,25,"On the plus side, Scott's plagues are cool. But it's a long slog to crocodile rocking, pestilence and Proactiv-proof sores."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,20,"I can’t fault Ridley Scott for wanting to stage a version of this saga, just as I can’t ignore the fact that my dad tells the same tale every spring, but much more engagingly, in half the time and drunk on Manischewitz."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,65014513,20,"This eye-rollingly bad movie is silly, sluggish and miscast."
Jackass: The Movie,6.6,64255312,80,"The Jackass boys achieve true genius, however, when they take their penance public. Before stunned, inert onlookers, these skate-punk Situationists transform official zones of work and leisure -- office parks, golf courses, bowling alleys -- into arenas of dangerous stupidity to remind us that, in the end, we’re all just meat."
Jackass: The Movie,6.6,64255312,80,One of the funniest films I’ve seen all year.
Jackass: The Movie,6.6,64255312,75,"Provokes a suspense halfway between comedy and horror. I'm not sure if I enjoyed myself, exactly, but I could hardly wait to see what I'd be appalled by next."
Jackass: The Movie,6.6,64255312,70,"Shrewdly, the Jackass gang didn't mess with their established formula in the transition to the big screen."
Jackass: The Movie,6.6,64255312,67,"All told, either you get it or you don't. Film critics and senators with election prospects don't. Kids in the mood to laugh at stupid shit for 87 minutes do. I'll toss my hat in the latter ring with glee."
Jackass: The Movie,6.6,64255312,63,"As much as I laughed throughout the movie, I cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment, or even performance art, although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain. Compared to these jackasses, Vin Diesel is a big, overpaid wuss."
Jackass: The Movie,6.6,64255312,50,"At their best, they're closer to the Three Stooges; at their most banal, they're as original as the Red Hot Chili Peppers performing nude with socks on their penises -- It's a hoot."
Jackass: The Movie,6.6,64255312,50,Unfortunately I can't give this a thumbs-up or thumbs-down; I haven't yet developed an aesthetic that will accommodate a guy firing a bottle rocket from his ass.
Jackass: The Movie,6.6,64255312,40,"Like a documentary version of ""Fight Club,"" shorn of social insight, intellectual pretension and cinematic interest.  It also offers a supremely literal-minded version of slapstick."
Jackass: The Movie,6.6,64255312,30,"It's plotless, shapeless -- and yet, it must be admitted, not entirely humorless. Indeed, the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost Dadaist proportions."
Jackass: The Movie,6.6,64255312,25,"Essentially a slapstick movie with no plot or -- as my boyfriend called it after recovering from 1½ hours of side-splitting laughter -- ""the ultimate big-screen TV experience."""
Jackass: The Movie,6.6,64255312,20,"Audience members are likely to feel like they're right there in the picture, suffering for no reason and trying to pretend it's funny."
Jackass: The Movie,6.6,64255312,0,"To call Jackass: The Movie the worst movie of the year is practically a compliment. This plotless, crudely videotaped collection of moronic stunts is a movie in the same sense that those hideous, velvet depictions of Elvis are paintings."
Jackass: The Movie,6.6,64255312,0,"This is the biggest lowdown, rotten, disgusting, depraved sideshow in the megaplex. Check your brains, your taste and your self-respect right over there with the bearded ticket taker."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,90,"A stylish and muscular thriller with some nifty twists and turns, a wicked sense of humor, several terrific performances and not one or even two but three of the best car chases in recent action-flick history."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,75,It works as designed.
Unknown,6.9,63686397,75,Unknown actually has enough of a sense of humor to admit what it is: hybrid corn. But it's been crossbred from Hitchcockian stock.
Unknown,6.9,63686397,75,Neeson has a way of getting upset - a frantic purposefulness - that fills viewers with both empathy and anticipation: He's so miserable that we care.
Unknown,6.9,63686397,75,"The weakest link in Unknown - okay, other than the utter preposterousness of its entire premise - is Jones, who as a modern-day version of Hitch's ice queens can't hold her own with the likes of Kim Novak, Grace Kelly and Eva Marie Saint."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,75,"It's all very Hitchcockian, at least for a while. And clever and exciting, too, even if the convergences begin to strain credulity, and, when you think about it, defy logic, too."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,75,"Sleek and, until a stupidly violent climax, very entertaining, Unknown is the opposite of ""Memento."""
Unknown,6.9,63686397,75,"Unknown is finely tuned pulp filmmaking, a dumb movie with a smart veneer, which is nothing to sneeze at."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,70,"Though cinematographer Flavio Labiano turns the city into an alien maze of steel and glass, his chilling work is undercut by a script with more logical craters than Martin's."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,70,"You could do worse than this fast-paced, cheerfully ridiculous, generally satisfying romp."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,70,"Despite its A-movie aspirations, as the chases continue and the plot holes widen, Unknown quickly settles into the familiar B-movie comfort zone."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,70,"A nifty international thriller of the ""what if?"" variety."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,70,"Jones delivers her line readings so robotically that even her truths sound like lies. She's got the look of a Hitchcock blonde, and the movements of a deer in the headlights. Even her kisses look fake."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,70,Director Jaume Collet-Serra provides a steady flow of suspense and a very Polanski-esque feeling of paranoia.
Unknown,6.9,63686397,63,"On a minute-to-minute level, it's an engaging mystery, the kind that rewards our participation with eye candy and adrenaline shots. But when we pull back for an overview, we see that it's flat and that pieces are missing."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,63,Neeson is much better suited to the loneliness and self-doubt of Martin's crisis than he was for the thuggery of the previous movie.
Unknown,6.9,63686397,63,"Unknown is never boring, and Collet-Serra mostly keeps up a lively pace, but he doesn't do the movie any favors with the flat, dull way he films the scene in which we finally learn what's going on."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,60,It is the rare conspiracy thriller that ripens as the villains' organization and motives are gradually revealed.
Unknown,6.9,63686397,60,"Twisty, engaging thriller."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,60,"Unknown is probably the movie ""The Tourist"" wanted to be, if it had a pulse. Its sheer momentum makes Neeson and Kruger more attractive than even Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,58,"Framed as a cautionary thriller about the perils of high-stakes terrorism, but I took away a different message from it: Don't forget your briefcase at the airport."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,58,The movie whips up a big old puree of ingredients borrowed from other cinematic recipes.
Unknown,6.9,63686397,50,"Not even Neeson, with his strength and his wounded-giant vulnerability, can prevent our interest in Unknown from sliding into contempt."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,50,The snow and haze that Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan) keeps pumping into the street scenes seem to have drifted into the script as well.
Unknown,6.9,63686397,50,"The art of the classic Hitchcockian thriller is about style, pace and misdirection – and though Unknown is occasionally baffling and involves running and car chases, the film rarely manages to thrill."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,50,ignore the pileup of implausibilities and Unknown becomes a diabolically entertaining con game. Does it jerk you around? Yes. Suck it up. The ride's worth it.
Unknown,6.9,63686397,50,"Yes, Unknown is preposterous. That in and of itself is not a reason to avoid the movie. The problems lie in the way the absurdity is presented and the manner in which the screenplay resolves once the ""truth"" is revealed."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,50,"Tacked onto a perfectly respectable thriller, Unknown's mass of unlikely turns and implausible reveals make the whole film seem retroactively less sophisticated."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,50,"I confess I felt involved in Unknown until it pulled one too many rabbits out of its hat. At some point, a thriller has to play fair."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,50,"It's a solid, engrossing thriller, but a slack one."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,50,"Beyond the occasional plot frissons and juicy supporting turns, it's an emotionally and psychologically threadbare exercise."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,50,"As with its protagonist, Unknown boasts tantalizing issues buried deep beneath its frantic exterior, but little idea how to unlock or address them."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,40,"This is no more (but no less?) than what we have rather oddly come to expect from Neeson in his late period (Taken, The A-Team)."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,40,"That's eventually what Unknown is - violent, impersonal and comforting."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,40,"There are a couple of intriguing ideas floating around here and there, but that's all they do - float around, unmoored by any sense of reality and, thus, suspense."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,38,"Trying to decipher all the convoluted pathways could drive you mad. Mostly, though, it is so ludicrous that it will unintentionally inspire laughter."
Unknown,6.9,63686397,30,All of the nonsense piled on nonsense does provide some measure of pleasure. Unknown gets better by getting worse.
Unknown,6.9,63686397,25,"Unknown makes no sense at all, so you not only worry about Liam Neeson's judgment in movies, but you begin to wonder if he's forgotten how to read."
Thunderball,7,63600000,80,[Bond] also has a much better sense of humor than he has shown in his previous films. And this is the secret ingredient that makes Thunderball the best of the lot.
Thunderball,7,63600000,80,Terence Young takes advantage of every situation in his direction to maintain action at fever-pitch.
Thunderball,7,63600000,80,"Sleek and quite fun all the same, with SPECTRE holding the world to ransom after stealing a couple of nuclear bombs, Bond almost getting his in the villain's shark-infested swimming pool, and a cleverly choreographed underwater battle to provide the icing on the mix."
Thunderball,7,63600000,80,"Though From Russia with Love remains the liveliest Bond opera to date, Thunderball is by all odds the most spectacular. Its script hasn't a morsel of genuine wit, but Bond fans, who are preconditioned to roll in the aisles when their hero merely asks a waiter to bring some beluga caviar and Dom Pérignon '55, will probably never notice."
Thunderball,7,63600000,75,"The underwater sequences, which are choreographed and directed with great skill, are Thunderball's standout feature... Thunderball is classic 007 -- not the best picture in the long-running series, to be sure, but a more-than-worthwhile diversion for the action-loving escapist in us all."
Thunderball,7,63600000,60,"Connery [is] cruising by this point and the movie doesn't quite match the swagger of Goldfinger, but still effortlessly plies the glory Bond years, concluding with a stunning underwater battle."
Thunderball,7,63600000,60,"The action is reasonably well-staged, but the film is overlong and occasionally draggy."
Thunderball,7,63600000,60,"Slightly bloated Bond, with too much technology and a climactic slaughter that's a little too mindless to be much fun. Still, Adolfo Celi—with his “heat and cold, applied scientifically”—makes a most memorable villain."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,91,It sheds the series' famous and influential pastel look and plunges its cast of villains and warriors into the 21st century.
Miami Vice,6,63450470,90,"Mann has done something transformative with Farrell: The Irish actor has never had this much charisma and natural authority in a role, and as he navigates that gray area between Crockett's real identity and his fabricated one, revealing subtle fissures in the character's cocksure facade, he's fascinating to watch."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,88,"If you're looking for a crime story that sizzles with action, sex and the visceral jolt of life on the edge, Miami Vice is the one."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,88,"Miami Vice isn't an action flick but a neo-noir: tough, quiet, moody and hard."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,88,"Sensual and scary, the movie is so visually textured you feel as though you're brushing against the screen."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,83,"While it never approaches the richness and gravity of a great Mann film like ""Heat,"" Miami Vice blurs the thin blue line to similar effect, and he features a couple of bravura setpieces, including a tense raid on an enemy hideout and a shootout with chaotic, you-are-there immediacy. If only all summer movies were this majestically slight."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,83,Right away in Miami Vice you know you're waist-deep in movieland.
Miami Vice,6,63450470,80,"It's a sensational trip -- gorgeous, gaga."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,80,"Mixing pop savvy with startling formal ambition, Mr. Mann transforms what is essentially a long, fairly predictable cop-show episode into a dazzling (and sometimes daft) Wagnerian spectacle."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,80,"The world according to Mann is loud, dangerous, morally ambiguous, and more than a little greasy, but during the hours you spend there, there's nowhere you'd rather be."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,80,"Bearing all the Mann hallmarks, this is visually enthralling, relentlessly stylish crime drama. A little too languorous for its own good at times, but still vastly superior entertainment."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,80,"The two best words to describe the 2006 motion picture Miami Vice are ""stylish"" and ""intense."""
Miami Vice,6,63450470,75,"As entertaining as some of it is, is so cool that it's almost too cool. It takes the sin, and much of the juice, out of vice."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,75,"This is more of a thinking man's action flick -- a small, intense film made on a giant canvas that finds Mann experimenting with and pushing at the boundaries of mainstream filmmaking."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,75,The movie is seriously sexy and seriously entertaining.
Miami Vice,6,63450470,75,"Unlike most TV-to-movie transitions, Mann returns to his roots and delivers what amounts to a slightly overblown episode, brimming with style and characteristically short on substance."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,70,"Without the ability to move off the mythic, without the emotional texture that ""Heat"" created, it is a film easier to admire than to get passionately involved with."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,70,"Mann turns Miami Vice into an exploration of tone and mood, and he makes that enough."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,70,"As it turns out, the movie is still very much about two well-dressed undercover cops who strike sexy poses, express plenty of attitude and drive expensive cars and fast boats as pop music plays on the soundtrack and palm trees sway gently in the tropical night."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,67,It's got some great action sequences and is peppered with genuinely dazzling images. It's also subtly infused with Mann's favored themes of men-at-work and the high price of loyalty to duty. But it hasn't got sufficient meat to warrant its draggy length.
Miami Vice,6,63450470,67,It's refreshing to hear some old-fashioned percussive tension in service of a director who knows what he's doing. Even when the screenwriter is losing his way.
Miami Vice,6,63450470,63,"Just when the plot should start coming together, the pacing goes slack and the narrative gets bogged down in routine cop-movie clichés."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,63,"Miami Vice is the last of the predicted summer blockbusters, and it delivers a
reasonable amount of popcorn excitement. But if nostalgia for the TV show is the
source of your interest, expect some disappointment."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,63,"A combination of muddy sound mix and players with heavy accents (particularly Chinese superstar Gong, who seems to have learned her lines phonetically) renders large swaths of dialogue incomprehensible, but the details of what's being said and done don't really matter."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,63,"It's about guns and sex and fast boats, and, baffling as it is at times, it's still the kind of brutal fantasy that many of us relish a great deal more than yet another aerated digital dream."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,60,"Dark, detailed and only really gets going when the gunplay starts."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,60,"A darker, grittier creature that, while benefiting considerably from Dion Beebe's HD cinematography, is a frustratingly inert affair -- a long and talky excursion that fails to engage the viewer from the outset."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,50,"It's filled with Mann's signature macho verisimilitude, but essentially it's the stuff of what, in saner fiscal times, would have been a B movie. Miami Vice delivers the thrills, atmosphere and romance it promises, but it doesn't resonate like major Mann."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,50,"Miami Vice, the movie, is an atmospheric muddle, as gorgeous and unintelligible as raven-haired stunner Gong Li."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,50,"Farrell appears to be a rarity in undercover culture, a vice cop who goes on the lowdown as an Irish beatnik. Oh, that's a good disguise for South Beach. As for Foxx, he's still channeling Ray Charles through squinty eyes and a kind of shaky head. They have zero chemistry."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,50,"Apart from a few sleek shots involving boats or helicopters, the action eventually devolves into a standard war-movie shootout."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,50,It's the supporting players who stand out.
Miami Vice,6,63450470,50,"Far from a disaster, but doesn't rank with Mann's best work."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,50,"If you really must see Miami Vice (and you mustn't), buy a ticket to something better, then slip into ""Vice"" at the 95-minute mark and watch the last third of the movie. No one involved will profit by your curiosity, and you won't miss a thing of importance."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,38,"All this movie has in common with its ancestor are speedboats, shotguns and drug-dealing Colombians."
Miami Vice,6,63450470,38,"Perhaps vice isn't what it used to be, or maybe Crockett and Tubbs just aren't all that interesting when removed from their appropriate time slot, but this may well be the dreariest and most monochromatic time you'll have at the movies all summer."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,70,"Konchalovsky handles the slam-bang action with robust efficiency, but what makes this shoot-'em-up nonsense surprisingly watchable is Randy Feldman's rapid-fire dialogue, which constantly undercuts the macho posturings while parodying Stallone's screen image...even though the spectacularly empty finale eschews character-based comedy in favour of Bond-style megabuck explosions and gadgetry."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,60,"Stallone and Russell play well off each other, and with Palance lurking in the background, this buddy-breakout never loses its way."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,60,"The plot is a recycled mess, the dialog is awful, and the character motivation is nil, but thanks to Konchalovsky (and a strong performance by Russell), Tango and Cash is not only bearable, it's likable. Responsible for some of the finest films of the 80s, the Soviet-born director brings an insane, kinetic energy to the film that makes for effective action sequences and potent satire. A very smart ""dumb"" movie."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,60,"Tango and Cash is loaded with sweating, straining, smashing and grunting, with bulging-bicep shots and sadistic special effects. Watery electrocution sequences are a particular favorite, since these mean wet clothes, shooting sparks, writhing bodies and other current staples of high style. Images like these are so all-important in Tango and Cash that the idea of storytelling has virtually been annihilated."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,50,"The ostensible humor here is of the macho one-liner variety, and much of it falls flat. There is just too much Ratso and Cowboy for us to believe in Butch and Sundance."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,50,"As written by Randy Feldman and produced by the Batman team of Jon Peters and Peter Guber, Tango & Cash clearly wasn't meant to be interesting. It was meant to be Lethal Weapon-that is, a high-tech, ultra- violent, brain-dead buddy cop movie. In Konchalovsky's hands, however, Tango & Cash is more than interesting. It is, in fact, really weird."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,50,"Tango & Cash is a mindless buddy cop pic, loaded with nonstop action that's played mostly for laughs and delivers too few of them. Inane and formulaic, the film relies heavily on whatever chemistry it can generate between Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell, who repeatedly trade wisecracks while facing life-or-death situations."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,50,"The jokes seem lame and the rivalry fraudulent, as the two boys play with their big guns."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,50,"Russell is an inoffensive Mel Gibson clone here. But Stallone is an unlovable lummox, preposterous because he takes himself so seriously. Even when he attempts to laugh at himself, his quips fall like clods on coffins. His bravery is braggadocio. Let's hope this will be the last of Tango."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,40,"However gaudy its credits, it is one more--and one of the worst written--in an endless line of clenched-up, crashed-out, buddy-buddy L.A. cop star vehicles. A waste of talent and energy on all levels."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,75,"The Sorcerer's Apprentice boils down to ""The Karate Kid"" meets ""Harry Potter,"" with maybe a dash of ""Ghostbusters"" to keep it interesting."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,75,A tamer tale of supernatural shenanigans that is far more appropriate for young children than the sometimes too-scary scenes from J.K. Rowling's stories.
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,70,"Cage will likely not earn a second Oscar here, but he and director Jon Turteltaub (National Treasure) make leftovers into fine PG malarkey with their hokey naïveté and prankish hocus-pocus."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,70,"The tone is both goofier and darker than the Potter pictures, and some of the magic battles built around New York City landmarks are eye-popping; there's also a genuinely affecting romance between Baruchel and fetching newcomer Teresa Palmer."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,67,"Turteltaub has a workmanlike touch and an easy sense of humor here, and he and his team do a better-than-expected job of keeping you interested in the story, despite it being yet another Tale of a Reluctant Young Man With A Supernatural Hero's Calling."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,67,"The Sorcerer's Apprentice is too long, and it's ersatz magic, but at least it casts an ersatz spell."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,65,"Turteltaub strives to show us realistic-looking magic, without realizing he'd be better off if he acknowledged that there's no such thing. Instead, we get human figures that emerge ""magically"" from swarms of cockroaches and sorceresses who dissolve into dust particles right before our eyes. It's the best CGI money can buy, and who cares?"
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,63,"The Sorcerer's Apprentice is a perfectly typical example of its type, professionally made and competently acted."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,63,"The CGI is relentless and what you might call reverse-magical: The more we're hit with stuff, the less wondrous it becomes."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,63,"As fun as it is at times -- particularly early on -- the longer The Sorcerer's Apprentice goes on, the more the magic wears off."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,60,"Despite Cage in a snit, it's a likable if functional summer-show."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,60,Big and brash with a fantasia of battles and chases thrown in to keep the young ones enthralled for its nearly two-hour running time.
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,60,"A frenetic, overstuffed but imaginative fantasy."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,58,"Baruchel aside, The Sorcerer's Apprentice contains a few minor delights. One is Cage's surprisingly low-key approach to a role that he could be expected to play over the top."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"A by-the-numbers, good-vs.-evil tale."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"A flavorless family-friendly action-adventure that doubles as memory exploitation. It has nothing to do with either the Mickey Mouse broom sequence of the same name from 1940's ""Fantasia'' or the 213-year-old Goethe poem that inspired it."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"On the whole, the movie is more Cheez Whiz than wizardly."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"While Mr. Molina and Mr. Cage supply a measure of well-compensated eccentricity, their labors ultimately serve to emphasize the grinding mediocrity of the enterprise."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"The lively verbal sparring between the good and evil sorcerer-apprentice pairs sustains the movie, but, with a predictable plot, by-the-numbers action-movie jolts and no real sense of wonder, The Sorcerer's Apprentice is really just a pumpkin."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"The movie isn't so much bad as it is formulaic and uninspired. In some ways, that might almost be a worse sin."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"Somewhere in recreational value between an afternoon on a San Diego beach and one at a Detroit public swimming pool. Either way, before you know it, it's evening."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"The lesson at the core of Goethe's poem -- that powerful spirits are not to be taken lightly, and should only be conjured by those who can control them -- goes out the window, and the mentor-student relationship gets swallowed up in the action. Bruckheimer may be the dark lord of Tinseltown, but he's the Mickey Mouse of this scenario, and the mops and brooms get the best of him."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"Cage is amusingly skanky, Molina is dependably arch, and Baruchel is engagingly down to earth. But do we really need to watch them play out this exhaustingly empty scenario?"
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,42,"While both actors have been hammier and more hilarious, and neither one overdoes things enough to be notable, they at least seem to be having loads of flailing fun as they conjure up CGI scenery to chew on. And when Apprentice limits itself to their battle, it's generally fitful dumb fun."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,40,"""Apprentice"" lurches from one been-there-done-that sequence to another."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,40,The magic here feels machine-made and depressingly state-of-the-art.
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,40,"Other than the Pottersploitation and presence of current It nerd Baruchel, this fantasy-action-comedy might have been spat out into multiplexes any summer over the previous two decades, yet it would seem like forgettable abracadabra filler regardless of the date."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,38,"A generally joyless pastiche of sorcery history, imitation Potter ""chosen one"" Messianics and mirthless silliness, it's another in a string of recent black marks against Cage's Oscar-owning reputation."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,38,"As Balthazar, Cage doesn't disappoint. He's just manic enough to keep the character from becoming too predictable."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,38,"The movie is a clunky, noisy contraption. Director Jon Turteltaub piles on gadgets and devices in the hopes we'll be dazzled enough to miss the story's lack of coherence and charm."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,38,"This booming, cartoonish confection is a transparent attempt to take a property Disney owns rights to, and to try and create a Harry Potter-like franchise."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,30,If there were any brooms in Disney's new Sorcerer's Apprentice they would have to be used to sweep this tired dreck to the curb.
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,25,"A two-hour trailer: explosion, shape-shift, chase, wisecrack, repeat. Its most amazing trick will be how it vanishes from your memory before the seat you vacate has stopped moving."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,25,"Cage and Baruchel work hard to stay accessible, but the computer-generated effects come on like heavy artillery blowing away any hint of flesh and blood. The Sorcerer's Apprentice should be rated U for Untouched by Human Hands."
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,90,"A thoroughly gratifying prestige thriller, thanks to riveting suspense and two brilliant stars."
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,88,"The flaws don't cripple what is a fiercely funny, exciting and provocative detective story about the crimes of corporate culture — crimes that transcend race and geography."
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,88,"The current media discussion over whether or not this is a racist film misses how much this is a classic hard-boiled detective novel, the Japanese functioning as an almost faceless evil."
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,78,"I found it pretty entertaining, as well as provocative in some of its comments about contemporary life."
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,75,"In the final analysis, Rising Sun is yet another book-to-movie conversion that loses something in the translation. Despite the always-welcome presence of Sean Connery, the film fails to satisfy completely. There are a few too many plot holes and logical errors. Rising Sun may be solidly-paced, but not all aspects of the production are as successful."
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,75,"A triumph of style over content. Like BLADE RUNNER, the film grafts a fiercely modernist feel onto characters and themes right out of a 1940s film noir--an impressive achievement that more than makes up for a ponderous storyline."
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,70,"There is some elegant and clever filmmaking in Rising Sun. But ultimately Kaufman and Crichton are a bad fit: trying to transcend the material, the director loses the novelist's crude but compelling urgency."
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,67,"What it all comes down to is that Kaufman gets the hard things right and messes up the simple stuff. If there isn't a Japanese saying for that, there certainly ought to be."
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,63,"There’s a real spark to Connery’s performance, but except for that Kaufman has produced a middling contradiction, a thriller too polite to hit its target."
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,63,"The screenplay by Kaufman, Crichton and Michael Backes is not about much of anything important, and Connery's deep penetrating wisdom takes away some of the suspense: If he knows everything that's going to happen, why keep us in the dark?"
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,60,The film's mysteriousness is not profound. Anybody who hasn't guessed the killer's identity after 30 minutes should be forced to watch Rising Sun three times a day until Christmas.
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,60,"The best seller's passions were misplaced, but in toning them down, the adaptation turns bland."
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,60,A wasted effort with a limp storyline that fails to do Michael Crichton's book justice.
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,58,"Rising Sun waters down the more contentious aspects of Michael Crichton's controversial bestseller about Japanese influence in the United States, while remaining faithful to its mechanical plotting and superficial characterizations."
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,50,"Connery lectures at length on his favourite subject, which wouldn't be so dull if the suspense was more adroitly handled, but Kaufman, regrettably, gets the pacing all wrong. Blowup-style video detection scenes provide a modicum of interest."
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,50,"Rising Sun boasts shiny, shiny production values befitting a big-budgeted Sean Connery vehicle adapted from a bestselling novel, but scratch the glossy surface and Rising Sun reveals itself to be a Cinemax-ready B-movie, complete with a rogue’s gallery of villains, each tackier and more ridiculous than the last."
Rising Sun,6.2,63095271,50,"Rising Sun has gotten everything backward. Mystifying when it should be clear and clear when it should be mystifying, it is the murkiest, most unsatisfying of thrillers. And the biggest mystery of all is how a project that appeared to have so much going for it could have gone so determinedly astray."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,75,An impossibly enjoyable live-action cartoon that plays on our real-life anxieties about vengeful cadres of foreign radicals blowing up people - and places.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,67,"Brash, brutal, and simplistic in equal measure, it’s a retrograde work that, for better and worse, delivers its old-school mayhem with punishing precision and unrepentant glee."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,63,"The film is a popcorn-crowd pleaser, but a “yippee ki-yay” or two away from something more memorable."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,63,"As action-thrillers go, this one provides what the previews tease. Maybe that’s enough for an evening’s mindless, throw-away entertainment, but I can’t help but be disappointed that the filmmakers couldn’t have brought something more inventive to a genre that too often relies on worn-out tropes."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,60,"While not nearly as elaborate, nor as visually sophisticated as the last Mission: Impossible outing or the most recent Bonds, London Has Fallen is actually more plausible at its core, if not in its details, which is partly why it succeeds in laying claim to an audience's attention for the entirety of its swift running time."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,60,It’s all so overly macho that it plays like a camp pleasure-cruise.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,50,The action is pumped up. The destruction is extreme. The whole thing is absurd.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,50,"Like its predecessor, the film is content to dumbly relish in the inanity of Mike's rampage."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,42,"The new sequel, London Has Fallen, implausibly ups its predecessor’s stakes to ""Die Hard in the City of London."" Unfortunately, widening the scope this dramatically causes the entire fragile action-movie axis to spin wildly out of control."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,40,"Najafi's R-rated London Has Fallen doesn't target the genteel viewer. Rather, it aims squarely for moviegoers who like their action bloody, their fights brutal, their body count sky-high."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,40,Remember “Olympus Has Fallen”? This one is worse.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,40,"It's all silly and meant to be fun, except when Najafi tries to throw in some serious bits, which wind up being sillier still."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,40,"Bloodthirsty, derivative and xenophobic nonsense."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,40,It’s a film that doesn’t so much invite you to switch off your brain as take it out and dump it in the nearest popcorn box.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,40,"Creepy “send them back to Fuckheadistan” sentiment overwhelms London Has Fallen’s guilty pleasures, its meaty violence and xenophobic nastiness giving the cheddar an unpleasant aftertaste."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,40,There is some surreal fun at the beginning as everything collapses.... But then it’s the same thing over again.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,38,It’s difficult to imagine anyone appearing in this film thought of it as more than a payday.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,38,"There’s little drama, but the fights and chases (Butler hanging out of a moving SUV) are exciting, if not very original."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,38,"The film, with its wearying gamer-style rounds of death, is routine at best."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,35,"Iranian-born director Babak Najafi (“Sebbe”) and the four credited screenwriters... make things move fast enough to keep you awake, but not fast enough to finesse its plot absurdities past an alert viewer’s mind."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,30,"As long as there are enemies in Islamic lands, we'll probably have to endure risible time-wasters like London Has Fallen, designed to justify blinkered foreign policy attitudes and stoke jokey hatred."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,30,"The action never stops once the first car bomb is triggered, but the second half of London Has Fallen takes place mostly in the dark, where nobody can see the budget."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,30,"For all the slicing and dicing of the editing, narrative momentum grinds to a trudge after the synthetic spectacle of the capital’s undoing."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,25,No characterization. A plot you could write on a single sheet of toilet paper. Sadistic violence we’re meant to cheer. A surprise that wouldn’t fool anyone who left the theater after the opening credits and came back for the last 10 minutes.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,25,"For the sequel, London Has Fallen, Butler and director Babak Najafi (HBO’s “Banshee”) strike a tone that’s more consistent — consistently dumb."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,25,"London Has Fallen is terrorism porn, an alarmist, jingoistic piece of CGI-soaked garbage that implores its audience to fear nothing after sensationalizing the slaughter of innocents and the destruction of a major city."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,25,"When viewing the action thriller London Has Fallen, there’s no escaping the reality that you’ve seen everything on the screen before — many, many times. For every bullet, and you will lose count, there is a cliche."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,25,"The special effects are worse than I thought modern studio filmmaking allowed for. Actors such as Robert Forster and Melissa Leo reprise their roles from the first film with maybe half-a-dozen lines apiece. Were it not for the presence of said actors, this could easily pass for a DTV spin-off."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,20,"Will this hard-luck president again defy death while his stoic sidekick vanquishes the nasty, uncivilized terrorists? It’s hard to care when a movie is this formulaic and moronic."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,12,London Has Fallen is remarkable only because of how much worse it is than its inane predecessor.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,12,A horrible and wildly unnecessary follow-up that might actually be worse than its predecessor.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,11,"Perhaps these are dark times, both onscreen and off, but even if they are not, London Has Fallen is an hour-and-a-half of viciously Us vs. Them, Trump-style bad filmmaking on all known levels."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,0,Make American movies great again. You can start by boycotting this one.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,0,"Racist, stupid and boasting cheesy effects."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,0,Perhaps the movie’s politics—which range from tone deaf to irredeemable—would be more of an issue if it weren’t so inept.
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,90,"For Your Eyes Only bears not the slightest resemblance to the Ian Fleming novel of the same title, but emerges as one of the most thoroughly enjoyable of the 12 Bond pix [to date] despite fact that many of the usual ingredients in the successful 007 formula are missing."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,75,"For Your Eyes Only is a solid adventure, although it could have been better. There's enough action to hold those with even a short attention span, and Roger Moore's deft charm hasn't yet begun to wear thin."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,75,"The success of this picture (perhaps Moore's best in the Bond series) can be attributed to the marvelous direction of Glen, who had previously worked as a second-unit director on earlier Bond movies. Not surprisingly, the stunts are some of the best in the series."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,70,"Most of the time, though, For Your Eyes Only is a slick entertainment...not the spaced-out fun that ""Moonraker"" was, but its tone is consistently comic even when the material is not."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,70,Glen's style...goes for the measured and elegant over the flashy and excessive.
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,70,"For Your Eyes Only is a competent James Bond thriller, well-crafted, a respectable product from the 007 production line. But it's no more than that."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,50,"To evaluate For Your Eyes Only and the other Bond movies, it helps to think of them not as, say, different vintages of a fine Bordeaux but as successive models off the Pontiac assembly line. In one vehicle there may be an annoying ping in the engine of narrative; in another the dialogue may be as sleek as Genuine Corinthian Leather. But all meet the same standards of speed, styling and emotion control. If there is no Rolls-Royce in the Bond series, there is also no Pinto."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,50,"Moore just looks confused. He obviously wants to do his thing then hit the bar for cocktails, but John Glen is nagging him to add a roughness to the slick exterior. Equally, it just doesn’t fit. The news is clear, there’s only so far you can push a Bond before it breaks."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,40,Eyes is somehow too relaxing to be satisfying.
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,40,"Worth a try, but without his Art Dept clothes on, Bond is like the naked Emperor. Look, Ma, no plot and poor dialogue, and Moore really is old enough to be the uncle of those girls."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,80,"Like its hero, Ender’s Game relies on brains more than brute force. An absorbing portrait of Lord Of The Flies-style morality housed in imaginative sci-fi casing."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,75,"Ultimately, the movie is not, to paraphrase the U.S. Army slogan, all that it could be. The climax is uninvolving generic eye candy, and the sequel-friendly coda is unconvincing."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,75,"Ender's Game is uneven - at times almost maddeningly so - with the first half offering more enjoyment than the second. Perhaps that's because, in military-style movies, I often prefer the training segments to the battle sequences."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,75,"A big, dark film that should satisfy the many fans of the Orson Scott Card novel and engage newcomers, too."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,75,"Ender’s Game is more than a parable about bullying, or a disquisition on the concept of the “just war.” It’s also a rousing action film, especially in Imax."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,75,"At times Ender’s Game throws so many metaphors and moral dilemmas our way, we almost forget to appreciate the stunning and gorgeous visuals covering every inch of the screen. Almost."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,70,"Straightforward, a bit literal-minded, very faithful to the book and largely compelling."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,70,"Its strong special effects make its simulated battles effective and, echoing the book, its story line touches on a number of intriguing issues."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,70,"An impressive, thought-provoking astro-adventure that benefits from the biggest screen available."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,67,"Plenty of ideas float through Ender's Game but the notion of honing a child into a war machine is one that sticks. Writer-director Gavin Hood's adaptation of Orson Scott Card's novel doesn't offer much else, bottled up with battle jargon and special effects debris as it is."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,67,"Though it can’t overcome the source material’s problematic themes — namely, Card’s intentionalist morality, which prizes a character’s ideals over their actions — or its all-too-convenient characterizations, the film manages a sustained sense of momentum and tone that is rare for a contemporary, big-budget movie."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,65,"Since it took 28 years to get it to the big screen, the fact that the end result feels rushed and hasty probably qualifies as irony."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,63,There's lots of zero-g action in Ender's Game - even old Han Solo takes a whirl.
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,63,"A bit of a tweener, neither triumph nor disaster, a war-games fantasy with a use-by date of Nov. 22, when the new ""Hunger Games"" movie comes out."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,60,"In the final analysis, that's the real endgame here: to get people into theaters and build a film franchise. For all of their film's flaws, Hood and company do that well, as Ender's Game shapes up as a decent franchise starter -- and a film that makes it hard not to be intrigued by what will come next."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,60,"Character development, dramatic tension and emotional resonance all get short shrift in the checklist exposition by writer-director Gavin Hood."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,60,"If only adapter-director Gavin Hood's movie had been tempered with craft and care and wasn't such a blunt instrument, one that seems designed as a delivery system for CGI derring-do instead of the heartbreaker it should be."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,60,This starfighter-recruit blockbuster is refreshingly idea-driven.
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,60,"The movie's apocalyptic finale indicates that it's bitten off considerably more than it can chew in terms of ideas, but it looks good, and the story rattles along."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,60,"It falters once the actual war begins: Ben Kingsley shows up as a Maori warrior with the weirdest imaginable accent, the final battle is uninvolving, and there’s an unconvincing upbeat coda. Ender’s Game ends up being fitfully engaging and endearingly odd."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,58,"By the time the movie finally manages to get interesting, audiences may be too numb and their retinas too fried to win back."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,58,"As a mainstream sci-fi film, this enjoyable, occasionally poignant effort too often feels messy in the wrong ways."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,55,"It may seem odd for a teen-focused action movie to feel so glum, but that's actually something that the director gets right, even if it threatens to make this a dull affair: Ender's Game is a dark story of a children's crusade built on the crushed psyches of damaged youths, and too much uplift would undermine it."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,"I can understand wanting to skip Ender’s Game as a matter of moral principle, but you can also feel free to blow it off just because it’s not that good."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,Ender’s Game is a blandly sanitized spectacle.
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,"Ender’s Game’s only lyrical presence is Breslin’s. The actress has a gentle soul. In the end, she’s the movie’s mascot, and its mournful spirit."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,"The film's biggest problem is a matter of tone and characterization: the characters constantly talk about how mean they can be, but their actions suggest otherwise."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,"It comes down to this: Which is more important, the innocence of a child or the survival of the species? And if the race survives, will it just become like the enemy aliens that must be destroyed to do so?"
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,Eventually the movie wants to have things both ways: to approvingly entertain mainstream audiences with the glittering spectacle of space battles and to pay lip service to the notion of conscience.
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,"Hood's realization of Card's novel is a tightly constructed, thought-provoking meditation on adolescence trapped by permanent war footing, alloyed with some of the best CGI effects work I've seen since, uh, ""Gravity."""
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,"Mr. Butterfield is one of those young performers whose seriousness feels as if it sprang from deep within. And while he’s an appealing presence, little Ender can’t help feeling like a pint-size psycho."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,"It’s a brutal story and a heady high-concept idea, but it plays out through characters with no identity other than their symbolic ones, and through shouted, simplistic arguments that repeat the same points over and over."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,"Sure, it’s good-looking, cautionary and clever enough. But there’s not much in this “Game” that you’d call thrilling or fun."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,40,"It admirably avoids many of the pitfalls of adapting this book, but seems to have lost some of the life and pace as well."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,38,"Most Ender's fans, of course, won't care about comparisons and consider the film adaptation a long-awaited victory in itself. Those fresh to the tale — or at least expecting something fresh from it — may wonder what the fuss was about."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,38,"Gavin Hood relays a vague sense of what it's like to live in duty, and yet at a distance from one's home, but this vision of the future never rouses, never asks to be remembered."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,30,Some of the movie isn't bad.
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,0,"Not only does Ender's Game have many scenes in zero gravity, but this zero-sum fiasco has zero drama, zero suspense, zero humor, zero charm and zero appeal."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,0,"Ender’s Game, the book, may have a special place in pop-lit. The movie, however, is as special as a migraine."

Three Kings,7.1,60652036,90,"The visuals are wild, the sound track has the audacity to underscore the subtext instead of just echoing the obvious, the comedy is irreverent and occasionally slapstick, and the metaphorical details are consistently strong."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,90,"A war movie with a conscience, an action movie with a funny bone, a caper movie with a shifting agenda."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,90,You walk out amazed and refreshed by the way it kicks the assumptions out from under the genre.
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,89,Impossible to resist.
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,88,"A work of strangely bold, distinctly American pop art - proud to be ashamed, ashamed to be proud, unafraid to ignore its commercial bearings."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,88,"Exhilarating, alternately funny and horrific film."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,88,"Russell has combined pathos, terror, and black comedy with a dollop of Hollywood feel-good patriotism to make one of the best studio efforts this year."

Three Kings,7.1,60652036,83,"So overstuffed with random fireworks that despite its politics, it's easy to imagine the film getting a four-star rave from Bush or Saddam."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,80,"Visual pyrotechnics and dark humor aside, Three Kings rules because it dares to dig for such truths, whether banal or significant."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,75,"A genre movie with an agenda that's too packed. Inevitably, some of the many balls it's juggling get dropped -- (but it's) one of the most entertaining and original actioners in several years."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,75,"So wild an approach demands straightforward performances that don't draw attention to themselves, and that's what the actors supply."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,75,"Better than the usual Hollywood rot, but dialectical it ain't."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,75,"Closer to ""M*A*S*H"" than ""Dr. Strangelove,"" which in itself wouldn't be a bad thing. But for all its engaging qualities, Three Kings doesn't seem to know what kind of beast it is."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,70,"An impudently comic, stylistically aggressive and, finally, very thoughtful manner."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,70,A nifty little war movie that defies convenient categorization.
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,70,"Increasingly muddled, cumulatively monotonous, would-be heartwarming, Three Kings becomes its own entertainment allegory -- searching, Hollywood style, for the point at which blatant self-interest can turn humanitarian, while still remaining profitable."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,70,Russell's stylish and imaginative filmmaking wages its own war against lunkheaded and sometimes offensive material.
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,50,It isn't nearly as successful a showcase for this filmmaker's extraordinary talents.
After Earth,4.8,60522097,88,"After Earth is ultimately too thin of a story to support all of its grandiose embellishments, but so what? It's better to try to pack every moment with beauty and feeling than to shrug and smirk. The film takes the characters and their feelings seriously, and lets its actors give strong, simple performances."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,63,"That there are no surprises (jumps, yes, surprises, no) should surprise no one – Will Smith movies must uplift the human spirit and reaffirm our best instincts while reassuring us that our ticket money has been well invested."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,63,"In truth, despite more corn than Mel Gibson grows on his farm in ""Signs"" (another Shyamalan effort), After Earth is worth a look."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,63,"Won't change your world, but it's attractive and Smith the Elder, lowering his voice to subterranean James Earl Jones levels, delivers a shrewd minimalist performance. His son may get there yet."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,60,"Jaden Smith takes centre stage in a futuristic rites of passager that plays like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone. Although ""Oblivion"" narrowly remains this summer’s better ruined-Earth actioner."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,58,"The movie takes off from a concept as basic as a videogame, and it sticks to that concept, without surprise."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,58,"Shyamalan’s sensibility may not be enough to turn After Earth into a great (or even very good) film, but it does yield interesting — and at times strikingly realized — results."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,50,"Though it's meant to be pulse-pounding, After Earth is a lethargic slog."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,50,"There’s nothing more to this movie than the set-up. Even though Cypher is slowly bleeding to death, and Kitai is running out of oxygen capsules that allow him to breathe in the toxic air, there’s no sense of urgency, either. At least Shyamalan, sensing the thinness of the material, doesn’t stretch things out."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,50,"M. Night Shyamalan has directed movies that are surprising, hokey, suspenseful, sentimental, clever, touching or cheesy. But until After Earth, he hadn’t made any that are dull from end to end."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,50,"The film progresses to the point where it feels less like father and son, and more like a young boy listening to an inspirational audiobook."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,42,"It’s impossible to take this movie seriously, certainly not as seriously as it takes itself."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,42,"The plot is simplicity itself, and Jaden's quirk-free character and bland performance don't add anything. It's actually a little sad that M. Night Shyamalan has descended to this sort of vanity-project work-for-hire, but at least he didn't insist on some absurd twist ending."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"Despite the Smith family’s association with Scientology, which unmistakably informs this tale’s belief system (“Fear is a Choice”), as well as its shaky attempts at mythic patterning, it is in no way the laughable shambles that John Travolta’s infamous ""Battlefield Earth"" was."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"Prepare to cringe and snicker whenever the characters are talking, but gasp when Shyamalan just shows amazing stuff."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"In his defense, the kid is saddled with a task that even a more experienced actor might have trouble pulling off: He must carry an entire action movie on his slender shoulders, given little more to act opposite than a succession of green-screen predators. Even with his charismatic dad in his earpiece calling the shots, Jaden can’t turn himself into a movie star by sheer force of Will."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"What undoes the film is its rather rancid parent-child sentimentality (a Shyamalan staple, admittedly) and a charisma-free performance from the younger Smith that suggests the apple has fallen very far from the tree."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"The jolts are of the jump-out-from-behind-the-door variety; you can see them coming from a long way off, too. Shyamalan seems to no longer have the confidence to let audiences figure things out or the patience to allow them to."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,This would be a difficult film even for the charismatic Papa Smith to carry. That he spends nearly the entire movie in a chair doesn't help matters.
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"The disappointingly generic film, which strands a father and son on Earth a thousand years after a planet-wide evacuation, will leave genre audiences pining for the more Terra-centric conceits of ""Oblivion,"" not to mention countless other future-set films that find novelty in making familiar surroundings threatening."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"The film is repetitive and not as suspenseful at it tries to be. Often gorgeous, sometimes fascinating, it is ultimately unwieldy and unsurprising. It fails as a Smith-family project. Jaden Smith, who was fine in ""The Karate Kid,"" is flat here."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,38,The art of storytelling is both of distinct narrative interest and personal issue in the latest payload of calcified nonsense from one of modern cinema's oddest would-be auteurs.
After Earth,4.8,60522097,38,"An undemanding, childish adventure picture."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,35,"A disastrous father-son endeavor about a calamitous father-son expedition, After Earth doesn't play to the strengths of any of its major participants."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,33,"Fans of either Smith will be sorely disappointed. The elder never before appeared this listless on screen, and the younger misplaced his unforced rapport with the camera that made the Karate Kid reboot so impressive. Only Shyamalan delivers what moviegoers expect from him, and that's a shame."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,30,Were Shyamalan and Smith deliberately invoking the terror — now omnipresent in urban African-American communities — of lethal asthma attacks in children? I’m not sure how I feel about something so real and so wrenching in the context of a Grade D (unfit for human habitation) sci-fi picture like After Earth.
After Earth,4.8,60522097,30,For the most part it is an uninteresting slog alleviated only by the occasional unintended laugh and moments of visual beauty. Mr. Shyamalan generally torpedoes his movies with overweening self-seriousness.
After Earth,4.8,60522097,30,"Running, or stumbling, only 90 minutes, After Earth may lack the neck-swiveling awfulness of Shyamalan’s ""The Last Airbender,"" but it quickly sinks in its logorrheic solemnity. The movie makes ""Oblivion"" seem as jolly a romp as ""Spaceballs,"" and gives neither Shyamalan nor Smith much to smile about."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,30,"Jaden is fine at running, jumping, fearful trembling, and affecting steely resolution. He doesn't yet have his father's charisma; perhaps to help him out, dad opted not to bring that charisma to the set."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,30,"Shyamalan is clearly a director-for-hire here, his disinterest palpable from first frame to last. Nowhere in evidence is the gifted ""Sixth Sense"" director who once brought intricately crafted setpieces and cinematic sleight-of-hand to even the least of his own movies."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,25,"The sad truth about After Earth is that not only is it difficult to find things it does well, but there are numerous examples of outright incompetence dotting the landscape."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,25,"You can’t blame Will Smith for wanting to give his son a leg up in the business. Maybe one day Jaden will have his father’s career — and his ability to carry a movie. For now, it’s a little premature to ask him to bear the weight of this soggy, waterlogged “Earth” on his skinny shoulders."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,25,"The young Smith has energy, but not the acting chops. And he's no miracle worker. The burden of carrying this dull, lifeless movie is just too much. And it's hell on an audience. It's not a good sign when you sit there thinking – Make. It. Stop."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,25,Surprise — this bad dream is for real.
After Earth,4.8,60522097,25,"Quite simply, this is one of the worst films of 2013."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,25,"Jaden is not ready for his solo spotlight, and the film is the same action over and over. Another bad movie from Shyamalan."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,25,"Basically, this is Smith and his real-life son, Jaden (both affecting ridiculous mid-Atlantic accents) talking the audience to death for something like 90 minutes before the closing credits."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,20,"He's done it again. M Night Shyamalan has done it again. Again. Done it. Again. He has given us another film for which the only appropriate expression is stammering, gibbering wonder that anyone can keep making such uncompromisingly terrible movies with such stamina and dedication."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,20,"The script has no nuance, none. And when Shyamalan moves into the director's chair, the script problems are magnified.  Everything is spelled out, underlined in red."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,12,"After Earth stupefies us with nonsense, such little thought and logic went into this idea that it can’t even be considered a rough draft, this is a movie almost daring an audience to emotionally detach throughout. For shame!"
After Earth,4.8,60522097,0,"Summer 2013 has its first bomb, and sadly, it’s landed right on Will Smith."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,80,"A hugely entertaining and more lavishly mounted follow-up to 2000's ""Shanghai Noon,"" the high-concept East-meets-Western that first teamed top-billed duo, pic rides even taller in the saddle as a fleet and funny crowd-pleaser."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,80,"With Shanghai Knights, he (Chan) has come through with one of his best. This time, it's personable."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,80,"Turns out to be that rarest of Hollywood creatures: a sequel that one-ups the originalThese two smart, happy movie stars prove that silliness doesnt have to be moronic."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,80,Far from great but greatly entertaining.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,80,"What Chan represents -- the humor and charm and the sheer physical beauty of seeing him in action -- as well as the lazy, ping-pong repartee he achieves with Wilson, is the essence of the casual, deceptively artless art of movies."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,80,"Coasts heavily on Chan and Wilson's charm, which would be a big problem if those prodigiously gifted stars weren't taking on roles that fit like two pairs of comfortable slippers."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,75,Bounds from one gag to another like an eager puppy.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,75,"The unlikely cowboys play off each other's strengths like the best doubles team in tennis.
The exquisiteness of this match is that Chan and Wilson are both reactive comedy actors."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,75,That his dialogue is often deliberately anachronistic is part of the joke -- and Wilson's sly delivery is often funnier than the lines themselves.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,75,This is an action-comedy sequel so indefatigably preposterous and farklemt -- as they say in certain Upper West Side saloons -- that it actually improves on the original.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,75,"There are three action sequences here so delightful, so hilariously deploying an old tool for a new use, that they prompt smiles long after I saw the film."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,75,"The star interplay and anachronisms recapture some of the surreal spirit of the Crosby-Hope Road movies, and the end-credit outtakes are funny enough to sustain that getting-hoary device for at least one more picture."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,75,"Actually a pretty entertaining movie, in a kick-you-in-the-pants kind of way. A relative rarity -- a solid no-brow comedy."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,75,A hoot.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,70,"Despite his advancing years, Chan delivers some fleet slapstick; like his hero Buster Keaton he works intuitively with levers, pulleys, ladders, and umbrellas."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,67,"This is a movie where you can just sit back and revel in it, warts and all."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,67,"For what it's worth, the film also goes out of its way to be a lavish visual re-creation of the 1880s."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,63,"It's a gimcrack assemblage of gags, action scenes, favorite moments from the first hit and diorama-like views of high and low Victorian culture."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,63,Uproarious imbecility.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,63,"Pretty mediocre entertainment, and probably better suited for home viewing than a trip to the multiplex."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,60,"The adventure-book pace and topsy-turvy English setting evoke the feel of Stephen Sommers's ""Mummy"" films."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,60,"Loving Jackie Chan has always been easy, which is why it would be nice if he could find better material in which to bask in his long-sought American stardom or, alternately, ease into bad movies as effortlessly as his co-star."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,60,"Only promised a few good fights, a lot of chuckles, and an easy way to kill a couple of hours. In today's Hollywood that's hard enough to deliver."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,50,So appallingly slipshod in all the usual departments is this sequel to the engaging martial-arts comedy Western ''Shanghai Noon'' that you're tempted to cite its makers for contempt.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,50,"Chan and Wilson's easy camaraderie remains eminently watchable, but the rough edges from last time out are missed."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,50,"Why would the writers bother with narrative when the story is just something that kills time, and brain cells, between feats and fists of fury?"
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,40,"Most of the film's humor derives from smug anachronisms (the Brit-pop soundtrack, Wang and Roy's use of modern slang) and jokes about bad English food, teeth and weather that were old when Victoria was a girl."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,40,I would also like to state for a fact that fight scenes in absence of all other drama arent interesting to watch.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,40,"If youre the type of moviegoer who finds the idea of 19th-century characters using phrases such as ""Be cool"" and ""You must work out"" in their conversations, this is the film for you."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,40,It's too bad Chan's imagination and delicacy were wasted in this movie.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,30,Grating.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,25,Desperately unfunny action comedy.
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,67,"Really, the whole series would be unthinkable without the films of George Romero. In that respect, Anderson has taken another page from the Corman playbook for his superior B-movie: If you're going to steal, at least steal well."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,60,"Shot in actual 3D rather than being the latest example of the horrible post-shooting conversion process, ""Afterlife"" undeniably looks terrific."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,60,"If you're interested in this movie, it's because you love either seeing zombies explode (check), the video games (major character included, check) or Jovovich kicking undead butt in every conceivable way (check and mate)."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,60,Anderson makes often-inspiring use of the 3-D effects.
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,50,"True to series form, plot is nearly indiscernible, but this fourth installment in the sci-fi/horror/action franchise created by writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson is the sleekest so far, thanks to 3D and star Milla Jovovich's body-hugging catsuit."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,40,Jovovich is on cruise control here and she fails to bring any kind of new life to a character that has been very good to her.
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,40,"What fun there is to be had is undermined by drab 3D, hacked-out dialogue and rehashed plots."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,35,"Sorry to disappoint the fanboys, but this is the first film in the Resident Evil series in which Milla Jovovich neither begins nor ends the movie stark naked."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,30,"It pains me to say it, but Afterlife, the latest installment in this seemingly eternal zombie apocalypse franchise, is considerably more entertaining than George A. Romero's most recent exhumation."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,30,"This witless installment features the usual ultra-slow-motion mayhem and helpful freeze-frames to allow us to admire the extra dimension. Fans will not be happy, however, to learn that Ms. Jovovich is more decently clothed this time around."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,30,Director Paul W.S. Anderson (who also directed the original) can hardly manage a hint of suspense or excitement. And excitement is exactly what the film ought to have in excess.
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,25,"It's a humorless movie of morphing zombies (they take on beastly attributes), phoned-in performances and trite dialogue."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,25,"Afterlife is slow-moving but relentless, and judging from a post-credits teaser that promises yet another sequel, it has an unquenchable appetite for your brain cells."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,25,"So nonchalant is Resident Evil: Afterlife, the fourth movie in Paul W.S. Anderson's dystopian franchise, that its overarching premise isn't explained."
Species,5.8,60074103,80,"Species is an Alien ripoff, but that doesn't make it a bad movie--not when it contains a plausible premise, a great-looking female villain, a wonderful supporting cast of good guys, and genuine tension. Only a routine chase sequence in sewer tunnels limits the excitement at the end. In other words, we're talking about a solid, surprisingly intelligent action picture here."
Species,5.8,60074103,75,"A propulsive sci-fi actioner genetically engineered from spores of the Alien and Terminator series, Roger Donaldson's Species provides a gripping if not overly original account of an extraterrestrial species attempting to overwhelm our own."
Species,5.8,60074103,75,"Director Roger Donaldson has a lot of fun with his premise. The top-notch special effects, which use a lot of seamless computer animation, make the climax look very nice. The rest of the film is essentially one long chase sequence with a couple of nude scenes and maulings added to liven up the proceedings. No matter what genre you identify Species as, it's not top of the line, but there's also quite a bit of room beneath it."
Species,5.8,60074103,75,Despite the ridiculous premise and casting this is still a pacey little sci-thriller.
Species,5.8,60074103,70,"I can imagine a film in which a creature like Sil struggles with her dual nature, and tries to find self-knowledge. Like Frankenstein's monster, she would be an object of pity. But that would be way too subtle for Species, which just adds a slick front end to the basic horror vocabulary of things jumping out from behind stuff."
Species,5.8,60074103,63,"If Species sounds ridiculous, it is -- though as ridiculous science fiction films go, this one has its moments. As usual, these moments come early."
Species,5.8,60074103,63,"The direction by Roger Donaldson is facile and understated, as is, for the most part, the script by Dennis Feldman. Even the actors pitch in to play down the silliness of it all."
Species,5.8,60074103,60,"A shameless Alien rip-off (it even uses a similar typeface in its ads), it makes no sense whatsoever. But don't hold the movie's utter unoriginality and brainlessness against it. A few laughs, a few popcorn-jolting scares—what more do you want on a hot summer night?"
Species,5.8,60074103,60,"Alien meets Basic Instinct in this textbook illustration of what happens when millions of dollars' worth of technical expertise is brought to bear on a cheap, exploitative script."
Species,5.8,60074103,50,"It doesn’t help that the special effects are second-rate; the squishy primal horror of Alien has been replaced by a kind of mechanized yuckiness. The team of B-movie scientists tracking the monster includes Ben Kingsley doing his over-deliberate American accent, Alfred Molina sporting a haircut that’s scarier than the creature, and Forest Whitaker as an empath so sensitive he can’t let anyone sneeze without making a dewy-eyed psychic pronouncement."
Species,5.8,60074103,50,Species carries the whole idea of the erotic thriller--that '80s yuppie genre that mixed sex and slaughter--past cliche into howling absurdity.
Species,5.8,60074103,50,"The director, Roger Donaldson, best known for the Kevin Costner thriller No Way Out, keeps the film moving. But there is only so much suspense he can generate from this stock story and familiar-looking special effects. Species may work best for viewers who don't like to be too scared by horror movies; it's reassuringly familiar."
Species,5.8,60074103,50,"Director Roger Donaldson may have started out aiming for intentional thrills, but ends up with unintentional comedy as his characters do and say the darndest things."
Species,5.8,60074103,50,"Like some state-of-the-art remake of Lifeforce, this is every bit as bad as Tobe Hooper's film, but nothing like as enjoyable. Worst is the transition in the final scenes from snatched glimpses of a woman in a rubber suit to some oddly alienating motion-control effects. Floating like the ghosting on a poorly tuned TV, these are far too clean and artificial to be believable or remotely scary. Deserves extinction."
Species,5.8,60074103,50,"What else can I say about a movie in which even a brilliant artist like H.R. Giger repeats himself… except that besides a few random moments, Species just doesn't make the grade and also manages to waste a fine cast along the way."
Superman III,5,59950623,75,"Superman III is the kind of movie I feared the original ""Superman"" would be. It's a cinematic comic book, shallow, silly, filled with stunts and action, without much human interest."
Superman III,5,59950623,70,"Unfortunately the pacy humour of the first half soon dwindles to a weak climax, and Pryor hams shamelessly, yet again proving that he's best in serious parts or as a stand-up man. Enjoyable, nevertheless."
Superman III,5,59950623,63,"Anyone who has been following the ''Superman'' saga will find this installment enjoyable enough, but some of the magic is missing."
Superman III,5,59950623,60,"Considering the standards set by the first two Superman films, Superman III is a disappointment. The story's mythic qualities had worn thin by the time this film was made, so the makers had to rely on Richard Pryor as their audience grabber."
Superman III,5,59950623,50,"The ideas might sound good, particularly the synthetic Kryptonite that turns Superman into a boozing jerk, but they never get developed, while high-profile guest star Richard Pryor appears somewhat puzzled at his own presence in the film."
Predator,7.8,59735548,100,"Directed by John McTiernan, it’s an ’80s classic full of still-thrilling action, quotable one-liners (“Get to the chopper!” “Stick around!”) and sly digs at Uncle Sam’s penchant for unwinnable jungle wars."
Predator,7.8,59735548,80,"Structurally, Predator is a classic behind-enemy-lines/buddy movies. Nothing much new, just well done."
Predator,7.8,59735548,75,"Moves at a breakneck pace, it has strong and simple characterizations, it has good location photography and terrific special effects, and it supplies what it claims to supply: an effective action movie."
Predator,7.8,59735548,75,It's got thrills and chills and one of the most elegantly conceived monsters in the history of movies.
Predator,7.8,59735548,70,"Crisply stylish and suspenseful, making brilliant use of optical special effects, Predator is one of Schwarzenegger's best."
Predator,7.8,59735548,70,A slightly above-average actioner that tries to compensate for tissue-thin-plot with ever-more-grisly death sequences and impressive special effects.
Predator,7.8,59735548,63,"Despite the off-rhythm styling and suggestions of primeval menace, there's really not much going on here."
Predator,7.8,59735548,50,"Alternately grisly and dull, with few surprises."
Predator,7.8,59735548,50,"Frankly, scarier critters have checked into Roach Motels."
Predator,7.8,59735548,50,"It's arguably one of the emptiest, feeblest, most derivative scripts ever made as a major studio movie. There's no need to do a Mad magazine movie parody of this; it's already on the screen."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,90,Del Toro moves his story along with unrelenting energy and wit while introducing the opposing parties with admirable efficiency.
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,90,"Surprisingly smart, graphically faithful live-action adaptation of the Mike Mignola series"
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,90,"One of the most poetic comic-book adaptations to come along in years, yet it never loses its sense of lightness and fun -- del Toro gives it just enough screwball nuttiness to keep it from bogging down."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,90,Guillermo del Toro is in a class with Peter Jackson as a fan-boy who gets it--a brilliant filmmaker who has a kind of metabolic connection to horror and sci-fi that helps him transform secondhand genre material into something deep and nourishing. Del Toro reaches into himself and finds the Wagnerian grandeur in schlock.
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,90,Hellboy just might end up being one of the best movies you see this year.
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,90,"One of those rare movies that's not only based on a comic book, but also feels like a comic book. It's vibrating with energy, and you can sense the zeal and joy in its making."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,88,The movie's got a heart as warm as hellfire.
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,83,"One of the sturdier superhero movies of the last couple of years, with monsters and effects and diabolical baddies to spare, a heart as big as a house and a love story that actually gets its hooks in you."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,80,"Mr. del Toro lets loose with an all-American, vaudevillian rambunctiousness that makes the movie daffy, loose and lovable."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,80,"Played by Ron Perlman, he's the most magnetic action hero I've come across in a long while."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,80,Directed by Guillermo del Toro with a colorfully kinetic visual imagination that seldom lets up.
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,"Hellboy likely won't be the best comic-to-screen adaptation this year, but, squared off against its early-season challenger, Marvel's ""The Punisher,"" this is the winner."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,"The film - despite being a half-hour too long - is a rocking, rolling supernatural spectacle."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,"The screenplay has flashes of real wit, and Perlman is perfect in the title role."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,"Hellboy may be a big, noisy goof of a comic-book action film, but love is in the dank, dark, subterranean air as the bulky red-hued palooka tries to win the heart of the pyrokinetic beauty Liz Sherman."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,Hellboy is on fire with scares and laughs and del Toro’s visionary dazzle. It’s the tenderness that comes as an unexpected bonus.
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,The movie has a self- deprecating sense of humor and a strong emotional core that vaults it above most action movies that come out this time of year.
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,"There are other filmmakers who might have been drawn to a comic book as enchantingly ridiculous as Hellboy.  But there are none who would have turned in a sleek $60 million picture as daringly silly, playful and imaginative as this one."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,"So forget about taking anyone under 12. But if you want to see what a benign demon looks like when he's eating nachos and unwinding to Al Green, this is the movie for you."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,"Hellboy is, to borrow a phrase, one helluva good time."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,"If the film's love triangle feels a little silly and the arch-villains a little over the top, it's all secondary to del Toro's passionate immersion in Hellboy."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,Has more than enough across-the-board appeal to attract mainstream auds unfamiliar with source material.
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,70,"An enjoyable if somewhat neutered defender of the free world. Make no mistake: Hellboy still has a hide as hard-boiled as Lee Marvin in ""The Dirty Dozen,"" but now he's also wearing a smile."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,70,"Pretty much impossible not to like a little, but it's also hard to like a lot. There's a fantastic film to be made from this material, but now, the burden of making it falls to a sequel."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,70,"To his credit, del Toro does not flinch from the ridiculous. But he is equally sensitive to Hellboy's pulp poetry."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,70,"While the film ably thrusts longtime fans of Mignola’s highly stylized artwork and newcomers alike into the world of that ol' debbil Hellboy, the film suffers from both scattershot character development and a serious case of H.P. Lovecraft overdose."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,67,"Will dazzle you while establishing the world in which it takes place. After that, you may wonder whether Guillermo del Toro got amnesia halfway through."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,63,"Surprisingly enjoyable, as adaptations of cult comic books go, thanks to a sense of humor all too rare in the genre, winning performances by Ron Perlman and Selma Blair, and a sweet romance of the kind that made ""Spider-Man"" a richer experience than its competitors."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,63,"It's a treat because, making no apologies for the source material, director Guillermo del Toro lets his picture gorge on power bars of pop energy, sugared with sprinkles of playful humour, and, at least twice, laced with a visual style so piercingly keen that horror morphs into beauty. Not bad for a pulpy outing."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,63,"Hellboy might not have the name-recognition factor of the Spider- or Batmen, but Guillermo del Toro brings the audience swiftly up to speed on artist-writer Mike Mignola's comic book anti-hero."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,60,"For all its f/x pageantry, it is rather tired, as if it's the third sequel of a franchise, not the initial episode."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,58,"Standard-issue superhero movie -- except that writer-director Guillermo del Toro, taking his cue from ""Hellboy"" comic book creator Mike Mignola, brings a wicked sense of humor to this particular monster mash."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,50,"Hellboy's adventures may take him to you-know-where and back, but the movie remains in limbo."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,50,"Arguing that you shouldn't expect rich characterization from a comic-book movie misses the point: Vivid relationships separate the graphic novels from the funnies and, in the end, spectacular set design is just window dressing."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,50,"Hellboy's cheeky attitude and snarky dialogue, specifically Perlman's snidely funny lines, are the highlights."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,50,"Hellboy is as much a wreck as ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" or ""The Punisher,"" coming and going in two weeks, and as much a bore as ""The Hulk."""
The Last Boy Scout,7,59509925,83,"The Last Boy Scout is a guilty pleasure by any standard, but I’ve seen plenty of guilt-free movies lately that aren’t this much fun."
The Last Boy Scout,7,59509925,75,"The Last Boy Scout is a superb example of what it is: a glossy, skillful, cynical, smart, utterly corrupt and vilely misogynistic action thriller. To give it a negative review would be dishonest, because it is such a skillful and well-crafted movie."
The Last Boy Scout,7,59509925,75,"The Last Boy Scout will win no year-end awards, but at least it delivers the goods-which is more that can be said for most of this year's holiday releases."
The Last Boy Scout,7,59509925,75,"The Last Boy Scout is overwrought, extremely violent, has a relatively unbelievable winding plot, perhaps the foulest mouthed teen ever, tons of low lives everywhere, lots of shots to Willis’ face, and is actually a pretty entertaining effort, an undeniable guilty pleasure."
The Last Boy Scout,7,59509925,70,"This is a movie for the boys who like watching men being real men - cursing, shooting and fighting - and anyone who likes this kind of wham-bam entertainment will certainly get more than their money's worth."
The Last Boy Scout,7,59509925,63,"Mr. Scott directs the film as if he were trying to win a prize for demolishing a building in record time. The opening is good: stylish video images of a night football game played in a torrential rain, climaxed by the only scene in the film that has legitimate shock. After that, the brutality and the pace don't slacken, but interest does."
The Last Boy Scout,7,59509925,63,"Despite the testosterone-charged violence and jaw-dropping sexism, the tone is one of self-conscious excess - a strategy which constantly undercuts the film's celebration of male bonding conventions."
The Last Boy Scout,7,59509925,60,"The story is beholden to the trendy steroid-and-TV world view: pump it up and cut it fast. Still, the dialogue, while fitfully glib, is wry and engaging, like a profane Raymond Chandler on speed. No one acts (in the Stanislavsky sense, anyway) but all perform well."
The Last Boy Scout,7,59509925,60,There’s really nothing special about this entertaining if mindless shoot-’em-up other than an ample supply of amusing juvenile put-downs and elaborate action sequences.
The Last Boy Scout,7,59509925,60,"The best things about The Last Boy Scout are the editing, Bill Medley's singing, a few moments of Noble Willingham villainy and Willis--whose weary, exasperated style exactly suits this kind of material. But the worst things about Scout are its slickness and self-confidence. A story about lonely heroism in a sick age should be a little hipper to what's really heroic and what's really sick."
The Last Boy Scout,7,59509925,50,"Producer Joel Silver and Willis keep trying to remake Die Hard. This time they call in Top Gun director Scott. The result is mildly interesting, but there are so many weird and gratuitous scenes of insane violence that the effect is drained of impact."
The Last Boy Scout,7,59509925,50,"A Roman circus of guts, glory and gallows humor, this lavish action thriller should sate the genre's increasingly bloodthirsty audience. Like the evening news, it fairly hemorrhages blood and sorrow."
The Last Boy Scout,7,59509925,50,"It's a kill movie, the filmic equivalent of a hate crime."
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,100,"As profound and intelligent as it is moving, and that makes this memorable motion picture one of 1996's best."
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,90,"Intelligent, involving and serious, it is as honestly emotional as Hollywood allows itself to get, a story of the search for wartime truth whose own concern for the genuine makes all the difference."
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,88,"The end of the film understandably lays on the emotion a little heavily, but until then Courage Under Fire has been a fascinating emotional and logistical puzzle--almost a courtroom movie, with the desert as the courtroom."
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,88,"In Washington's haunted eyes, in the stunning cinematography of Roger Deakins (Fargo) that plunges into the mad flare of combat, in the plot that deftly turns a whodunit into a meditation on character and in Zwick's persistent questioning of authority, Courage Under Fire honors its subject and its audience."
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,88,Denzel Washington is riveting.
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,83,"A large-scale military drama with a quiet, almost mournful center."
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,80,"A sober, intelligent drama with surprising integrity."
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,80,"A downright entertaining combo of mystery, melodrama and action adventure."
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,80,"Despite its underlying predictability, Courage Under Fire manages warmth, intelligence and a healthy share of surprises."
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,80,"Edward Zwick's high-minded new outing offers plenty of old-fashioned movie virtues such as believable action, plausible psychology, fully played-out confrontations and honest emotions."
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,80,"This is a good, solid, intelligent drama about the ambiguities of what does and doesn't constitute courage under fire"
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,80,This is - gasp! - a Hollywood movie actually daring to bare its teeth at silly American flag-waving.
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,75,"At the end of Courage Under Fire, you feel torn between admiration and annoyance with the filmmakers."
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,75,"Edward Zwick directed this reasonably thoughtful drama, helped by Denzel Washington and Meg Ryan in the main roles."
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,75,"While the account of Walden's heroics doesn't necessarily move from legend to fact, it does push the bounds of truth and raise interesting questions about the function of truth for the survivors of war."
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,67,"Patrick Sheane Duncan's script deftly weaves together the stories of Serling and Walden, and Zwick remarkably sidesteps the trap of sticky sentiment--an idea further carried forth by Ryan's admirably against-type (and shamefully unsung) performance."
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,60,The film seems to want us to pin a medal to its own chest.
Courage Under Fire,6.6,59031057,60,"I sat through ""Courage"" with interest, but I wasn't particularly moved or riveted with suspense."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,88,"The richly constructed first hour is so superior to any feat of sci-fi speculation since ""Minority Report"" that the bland aftertaste of the chase finale is quickly forgotten."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,83,Farrell's diction is a noticeable upgrade from Schwarzenegger's but there's also his superior portrayal of sweaty apprehension and killer instinct.
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,75,"Total Recall is well-crafted, high energy sci-fi. Like all stories inspired by Philip K. Dick, it deals with intriguing ideas. It never touched me emotionally, though, the way the 1990 film did, and strictly speaking, isn't necessary."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,70,"Total Recall is a doggone good time, with a bunch of nifty technical and visual flourishes, competently managed plot twists and elegant, Wachowski-esque action choreography that eventually becomes deadening because there's just too much of it and it's dialed up too high."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,67,"Director Len Wiseman is good on action, and Patrick Tatopoulus's dystopic production design is within hailing distance of ""Blade Runner,"" his chief influence. But essentially this is a big-screen video game."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,67,"Wiseman's PG-13 remake isn't as funny, or vivid, or splatter-tastic. It contains no mutants, inflating heads, trips to Mars, or freaky little psychic dudes named ""Kuato"" emerging from people's stomachs. But it does a decent job setting up an unsubtle dystopia."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,63,"Today's Total Recall does nothing to tarnish the image of yesterday's – 22 years from now, I expect it to be hailed as a classic."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,63,"Strip away the video-game visual effects, the endless chases and zero gravity shootouts, and Total Recall comes down to this: What is reality?"
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,63,"The movie marches in predictable formations as well. But when Biel's rebel pulls over in her hover car and asks Farrell if he'd like a ride, your heart may sing as mine did."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,60,Wiseman's Total reboot won't betray your fond memories of its iconic predecessor. But those hoping for a real head trip - a truly cerebral Dick adaptation - will have to keep waiting.
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,60,"The outcome is engaging enough, although not entirely satisfying from either a genre or narrative standpoint, lacking both substance and a degree of imagination."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,55,"The two films have the same underlying bone structure, sure, but this new Total Recall is made of more serious, more humorless stuff. It looks simultaneously lavish and interchangeable in its explosions and shoot-em-ups with a dozen other recent action movies, and in its sci-fi stylings with a dozen others in the genre."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"Set in a high-tech yet shabby future, the remake of Total Recall is a fully realized piece of production design. But its script, credited to six authors, is more like a preliminary sketch."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"For all of its dazzlingly rendered cityscapes and nonstop action, this revamped Total Recall is a bland thing - bloodless, airless, humorless, featureless. With or without the triple-bosomed prostitute."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"So what makes this 2012 Total Recall superior to the Arnie model? For starters, there's an actual actor in the starring role."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"Instead of drawing the audience in, the action scenes merely blur together. And the intriguing, thoughtful concepts at the story's core are glossed over."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"The only laugh to be had in Total Recall, a ripsnorting sci-fi action extravaganza that starts well and works its way down to average, is in the opening credits, where we learn that the movie's primary production company is called Original Film. Really?"
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,This one is somberly kinetic and joyless.
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"The new PG-13 movie is a fairly close adaptation of the Verhoeven, and lacks not just the earlier film's newness but its vigor, density, humor and R-rated juice. It's like the dinner-theater revival of a classic play, whose single asset is to remind those present how good the original was."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"I rarely pinpoint the exact moment when a promising action movie turns into a pulpy, asinine mess, but I can do that with Total Recall."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"Crazy new gadgets, vigorous action sequences and a thorough production-design makeover aren't enough to keep Total Recall from feeling like a near-total redundancy."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"This Total Recall is fast, furious, and frequently confusing fun, but to be completely honest, it lacks the snappy, weirdo vibe of its predecessor."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"The biggest flaw of the 1990 Total Recall was how disappointingly banal the endgame was. Wiseman adds some special effects and Michael Bay-style pyrotechnics, but the result is similar. It's doubly deflating because one of the great advantages of remaking a movie is being given the opportunity to correct problems - something not attempted here."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,42,"A pastiche of almost too many movies to count as a remake of just one, Total Recall is mindless, middling fare that fails to utilize – much less expand – the provocative concepts at the core of its iconic 1990 predecessor."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,42,"Wiseman's Total Recall isn't intellectualized like ""Blade Runner,"" or even that much more sophisticated than his ""Underworld"" movies."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,"It's a bit of a flavourless CGI-fest, without the character and comedy of the Arnie version, and it never really gets to grips with the idea of ""reality"" as a slippery, malleable concept."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,"Perhaps no more absurd than the Verhoeven version, but certainly less amusing. Farrell and Beckinsale emerge unscathed, but the endless scrabbling for novelty and reinvention leaves this feeling unaccountably stale and familiar."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,"Entertaining in small doses, but gruelling at two hours, Wiseman's derivative, spec-hackular upgrade bins the twisted wit and meaty thrills of the Arnie original."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,"There isn't anything in this Total Recall to match the immortal Arnold Schwarzenegger send-offs, ""See you at the pah-ty"" and everyone's favorite alimony killer, ""Consider this a divorce."""
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,"Like a drug that starts with a rush and ends with a headache, Total Recall is too much of a good thing."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,"This premise contains the seeds of an interesting economic and political allegory, but the ambitions of the filmmakers - lie in the direction of maximum noise and minimum sense."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,Hardcore genre fans will likely be quite disappointed to find a film that trades vision and originality for something best described as bland and inoffensive.
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,"There's a lot of eye candy in what ends up being a slick, breathless and at-times enjoyable sci-fi update. Unfortunately, it's what Wiseman forgets to do that makes the biggest difference in his film -- and which keeps it from becoming much more than a glossy missed opportunity."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,"It's big and it's loud, but ultimately not much more than that."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,38,"As for a villain, you could do worse than Bryan Cranston as the evil political overlord who is trying to stamp out the resistance -- When he goes mano a mano with Farrell, it's not spine-tingling. It's embarrassing, like watching a dude beat up his dad."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,38,"Len Wiseman's Total Recall's a trifling mess, as superfluous as a third breast."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,30,"Where Paul Verhoeven's original was testosterone-stupid and, therefore, fun, Wiseman's film is just boring-stupid."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,30,"The remake has no grace notes, or grace, no nuance, no humanity, no character quirks, no surprises in the dialogue and no humor."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,25,"The new Total Recall fails on the most basic levels: Its characters are dull, and its action is duller."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,25,"Since the new Recall is totally witless, don't expect laughs. Originality and coherence are also notably MIA."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,20,There's something sadly poetic about a movie dealing with disappearing memories that vanishes from your mind while you watch it.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,80,"With few words and the odd squint, Cruise hard boils all of his charisma into a clenched fist, but is more than happy to let a dynamic Smulders take the lead in many scenes."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,80,"Overall, a superior sequel. Some people will never get over the height discrepancy but character-wise, Never Goes Back brings Reacher closer to the books for the type of thriller that rarely gets made these days."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,75,"Somehow, Reacher gets under your skin with his mordant wit, razor-sharp intelligence, and existentialist intensity."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,75,"This is a superior and assured action movie, a quality product that makes the case for a franchise."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,75,"Cruise finds the core of Reacher in his eyes, with a haunted gaze that says this lone wolf is still on a mission and still a long way from home. That's the Reacher Lee Child created in his books. And Cruise does him proud."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,70,"This Reacher outing has its imperfections and its obstacles to overcome, but the strength of the character and the briskness of the action make it acceptable if you are in the mood."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,70,"With all the action movies that have come before, it's tough to make car chases and fist fights seem original and exciting, but fortunately, there's enough of a story to keep things interesting even when you might feel a sense of déjà vu."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,70,"Never Go Back could have used a bit more personality in the bad guy department, and the middle section sags a bit before the inevitable (and satisfying) denouement. But everyone involved seems to understand exactly what kind of movie they’re trying to make, and they deliver on just about every promise made by the title Jack Reacher: Never Go Back."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,63,It all makes for competent but routine suspense.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,62,"It’s nothing special, but it’s nothing awful, either."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,60,"It shouldn’t seem shocking, but the most interesting thing about this second Cruise-fired action film based on author Lee Child’s nomadic, ex-military hero is its action."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,60,"If Zwick’s film improves on Christopher McQuarrie's inaugural, incoherent 2012 entry in the series, it's not through any special initiative on the film's part. But it's efficient, unfussy, and doesn't try to think any faster than it can run."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,60,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is always faintly diverting but never particularly engrossing, putting the venerable movie star through his paces without really asking much of him."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,60,"There is no juicy high-concept baddie this time around, but there is a lot of enjoyable hokum and cheerful ridiculousness."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"The movie is lighter, more fun, and ultimately more satisfying than its weighty predecessor."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"There’s no mystery, and the action is thoroughly disposable, but what works this time around are the interactions between Reacher and Turner, mostly thanks to the efforts of Smulders, who brings an impassioned frustration to her character."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"Tom Cruise may be an A-list action star, but the Jack Reacher films are beginning to feel like the B-movies of his career."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,The first scene in Jack Reacher: Never Go Back promises something interesting but delivers something considerably less. That’s a problem with the whole movie.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"The latest Reacher film is directed, with reasonable skill and no trace of personality, by Edward Zwick, based on a screenplay taken from the 18th novel. I wish I had more dynamic news to report, but contrary to Reacher's own violent tendencies, some things in life and the movies practically defy a strong reaction."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"When it works, it works. But if this character and this franchise are to survive, “Never Go Back” needs to be a promise Reacher makes — about ever playing a parent again."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is a major step backward with an A-list actor in a C-grade military thriller.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"It’s a pity that Jack Reacher: Never Go Back fails to support Cruise and his co-stars, all of whom are acting as if their lives depended on it. There’s a great movie buried somewhere in here—a strange but beguiling family comedy and a meditation on nature vs. nurture, with a bit of shooting and punching thrown in—but the filmmakers never figure out how to excavate it."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"It’s two solid hours of disposable, forgettable action-thriller filmmaking with a competent Cruise performance in the middle."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"Like its predecessor it’s an unremarkable placeholder until the next ""Mission: Impossible"" flick comes along."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"With anybody other than a superstar like Tom Cruise in the title role, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back would just be a routine potboiler. With superstar Tom Cruise in the title role, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is … a routine potboiler."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"Tom Cruise is as muscly and bland as heroes come, restrained by the burden of two dead-weight companion pawns. Jack Reacher is a man who thrives on working alone, and this dull tale of backstabbing militant leeches proves that fact tenfold."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,42,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is harmlessly generic.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,42,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back isn’t a throwaway, and mainstream action/thriller fans should come out more than satisfied at the visceral nature of the film. But anyone hoping for more than a superficial on-the-run chase movie will probably wish Reacher had stayed home, instead of going back."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,42,"Cruise’s undeniable star power is all that keeps “Never Go Back” from feeling like it came off a studio assembly line, though you’ll still spend most of the movie wondering if you’ve been swindled into watching a movie about Ethan Hunt’s luddite twin brother."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"As a thriller, it’s lethargically paced, uninspiringly edited, and hardly raises your pulse even during life-or-death mano-a-mano."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"The result is a well-executed but stubbornly formulaic crime thriller that telegraphs most of its major surprises long before they ever happen. It's not a bad movie, mind you. It's just one that will strike viewers as exceedingly familiar, and as generic as that say-nothing title."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is the second movie that Tom Cruise has starred in as this title character. Let’s hope it’s the last.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"Never Go Back is boilerplate action-thriller, filmed with an anonymous style and scripted so that characters talk in catchphrases."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"Sometimes the film’s frenetic pace works, as in a brutally efficient half-second fight in an airplane bathroom. But more often, it feels like cinematographer Oliver Wood and editor Billy Weber are feuding."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"By-the-numbers plotting, seen-it-all-before action moves, banal locations and a largely anonymous cast alongside the star give this a low-rent feel."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"Zwick barely manages to tickle our adrenaline, waiting till the climactic showdown amid a New Orleans Halloween parade to deliver a sequence that could legitimately register as memorable."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,38,"But hey, at least Zwick and company carve out some time for Tom Cruise to run, with Reacher dashing across a busy avenue for about 18 seconds or so. It’ll make for a great supercut one day."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,38,"Unfortunately, as with too many films being made with the international market in mind, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is a jumble of overhyped action scenes, trite dialogue, painfully bad “character development”, and awful writing."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,38,The whole thing is just so sloppy and dumb and overflowing with clichés.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,38,"You cannot always judge movies by their titles, but you sometimes get good advice. The sequel Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, supplies its own five-word review."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,38,"The visual blandness of Edward Zwick’s style and the simplistic, easily solved case is better suited for television."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,25,"Of course, action movies don’t have to be believable or poignant. They just have to get your adrenaline pumping. But the movie lacks inspiration in that department, too, owing to action sequences you’ve seen before, familiar music and dialogue so predictable you could make a game out of guessing the next line."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,25,"Even as a star text, it’s shoddy."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,100,"RoboCop is no canned remake of the 1987 action film. It's a reimagining that responds to everything that has changed in American life over the past 27 years, addressing new threats and exploiting new anxieties."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,83,"As viscerally exciting as Padilha's RoboCop can be, the movie is elevated by serious considerations of the ethics of using robots as guardians (shades of drones), commercialism, playing God with science, and what being human is about."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,80,"Taking the original and successfully transplanting it into an ambitious new world, José Padilha’s english-language debut is an exciting, pacey and thoughtful sci-fi actioner."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,75,Jose Padilha's Robocop reboot does some of the things a good remake should do: it retains the central ideas and themes of the original while updating and rearranging the narrative to lose a derivative feel.
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,75,"This movie comes at you with an idea or two, as well as every available gun blazing."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,75,RoboCop is a solid near-future action pic that poses moral questions about artificial intelligence and remote-control combat systems without getting too preachy or ponderous about it.
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,75,"This RoboCop earns its stripes, mostly for the seriousness with which it treats its Frankenstein story."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,75,"RoboCop is topically up-to-the-moment but stylistically it’s retro. Far from using the story as an excuse to string together cheap thrills and blowout spectacle, its hero has all the heart of the Tin Man."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,70,It’s a rare “reboot” that transcends its studio’s money-grubbing. It has some Big Ideas.
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,70,"It’s a less playful enterprise than the original, but meets the era’s darker demands for action reboots with machine-tooled efficiency and a hint of soul."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,67,"The film has lots of energized mayhem, and Murphy's unraveling of the conspiracy against him isn't dumbed down, yet it's as if the comic-book action poetry of the original has been encased in a suit of generic armor."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,67,"There are enough rough edges and interesting kinks across the two-hour running time that you come out forgiving it for the more generic elements, though we'll acknowledge that the flaws might stick out more on a second viewing, when you're not just pleasantly surprised that the whole thing isn't a stinking mess."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,66,"RoboCop has sound and fury to spare and even an inspired idea or two lurking beneath that polished exterior, but much like its upgraded namesake, this watchable mess ultimately lacks a prime directive to call its own."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,63,"Though this RoboCop can’t come close to capturing the clever-silly audacity of the original, one area in which the current film easily surpasses it is in the quality of the cast."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,60,"It's well made, polished, and hits every mark — but is it crazy to want a futuristic sci-fi action flick about a motorcycle-riding metal supercop to be just a little more fun?"
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,60,"A nicely cast, respectable remake."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,60,"Every bit of it is more advanced: The actors are better, the plot is tighter, the special effects sleeker, the messages more heartfelt. Yet it lacks Verhoeven's bloody, biting scream."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,60,"Thanks to a good cast and a willingness to stray fairly far afield from the source material, it’s better than you might think."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,60,"This is a slicker, shinier, admittedly inferior affair. But with a strong cast, a roaring pace and at least one genuinely unforgettable scene, it’s by no means a write-off."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,60,"The film is not only unchallenging, it seems actively scared of challenging us. You emerge feeling pacified and only semi-entertained."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,60,"In some ways, the thoughtful, dense script marks an improvement on the original, and the cast is certainly tonier this time around. What’s missing is the original’s evil wit, amoral misanthropy and subversive slipperiness."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"Brazilian director José Padilha (Elite Squad, Bus 174) soldiers on stolidly, but lacks the Dutch Verheoeven's abiding sense of mischief."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"Neither Alex Murphy’s internal moral conflict nor the larger, vaguely satiric portrait of a global culture dependent on high-tech law enforcement seem to be the main point of this Robocop remake, which raises the question of what is meant to be the point."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"What we’re left with is a teen-oriented action flick with an A-minus cast, a mixture of “Transformers”-style robot battles and cops-and-robbers showdown that never feels all that exciting or cutting-edge, bracketed by some intriguing and half-successful moments of social commentary."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"A faithful remake of RoboCop would be timely. Instead, the producers of this new version have retreated back to the lab, concocting a creaky hybrid of “Frankenstein” and “Call of Duty.”"
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"Aggressively loud, terminally mediocre."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"The film doesn't embarrass itself or dishonor its predecessor, which is something."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"Moviegoers are stuck with this sci-fi thriller's bland story, murky cinematography and frenetic special effects."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"Although the movie isn't a complete disaster, it's not your father's RoboCop either."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"Director Jose Padilha (the “Elite Squad” movies) knows how to create slick, sometimes clever fast-moving battle sequences... But other than Keaton’s Sellars, the bad guys are mostly generic nitwits."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,40,"The result is fitfully interesting, and Mr. Kinnaman, best known for ""The Killing"" on television, compels our empathy with a kind of macho melancholia. Still, the whole thing comes down to an action adventure that's graphics-rich, logic-poor, coherence-challenged and pleasure-impaired."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,40,"While retaining the core story of a bionic man tormented by the memory of his former human life, the film doesn’t play with the concept or give it new dimension. The whole enterprise raises the question: Why do filmmakers insist on remaking movies for no good reason?"
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,40,"There’s no harmony at all to the elements tossed into the new remake of RoboCop, but credit screenwriter Joshua Zetumer and director José Padilha for at least having some elements in play."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,40,"Any improvements over the original RoboCop are mere window dressing, more a superficial function of technical advances in filmmaking than of any sort of storytelling prowess or fresh narrative ideas."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,40,"There’s nothing wrong, of course, with sci-fi films asking Big Questions, but the delivery doesn’t have to be — should never be, in fact — this tedious."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,38,"Yes, the technology has improved in the 27 years that have passed. But the ensuing years have also produced first person shooter video games which utterly preclude the need for this as a movie. Visceral, violent toys that they are, they still have more heart than this."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,38,"Ultimately the film is, like the Faux News programming it caricatures at face value, a deck-stacking simulation of a dialogue it isn't even remotely interested in opening."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,25,"The main thing wrong with Robocop is that it's dumb, and it's trashy, and it's both of those things in a not-good way."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,25,"For all its playfulness, the new RoboCop can’t help but lack the novelty of the original’s jolting mixture of dumb-smart irony and visceral pulp."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,20,"The remake of the 1987 cult actioner Robocop is a misguided failure — not only because its retooled half-man/half-machine hero now has emotions, but also because its “fear the machines” message winds up feeling creaky."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,20,"A deafening, boring action pile-up that is more Call of Duty than Robocop."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,91,"It's a gorgeously atmospheric, perfectly cast, beautifully crafted oater of the old school, made with heaps of integrity, no gimmicks and few concessions to the box office. Its only real flaw is that it strains a bit too hard to be a ""classic"" western."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,90,"There's a lot in this movie, simple, big, small and exciting. It's the year's first serious contender for big prizes. What's not to like about this picture?"
Open Range,7.5,58331254,90,Open Range gets better the deeper you get into the story.
Open Range,7.5,58331254,90,An imperfect but deeply involving and beautifully made Western.
Open Range,7.5,58331254,88,"It's a fine, old-fashioned 2 1/4 hours at the Bijou."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,80,"Here is a Western without irony or innovation, without any of the overt efforts toward revisionism weve come to expect even from Eastwood -- a movie that waxes elegiac about the end of the West, but remains sure that cowboys and cattle and ramshackle frontier towns will live on in perpetuity at the cinema."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,80,Costner sets course for one of the most stirringly choreographed shootouts in movie history.
Open Range,7.5,58331254,80,"An intensely scenic, refreshingly humanistic oater that dares to be sincere and open-hearted."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,80,"It's a real and rare pleasure to see Costner and Duvall together -- these masters of intense passivity, who know how to be watched when they're listening."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,80,"Say what you like, think what you will, scoff if you have to (and you will definitely have to), but in the final analysis Kevin Knows Westerns."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,80,"A return to the Western in its pure, cinematic form."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,80,"Nobody smells of sagebrush, campfire coffee, tobacco (smoked or chewed) and saddle soap like Duvall."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,80,"This is a great two-hour motion picture. Unfortunately, it runs 20 minutes longer than that."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,75,"A patient, suspenseful exercise in genre craftsmanship"
Open Range,7.5,58331254,75,"Open Range could easily have lost 20 minutes in the editing room, but its very casual pacing and beautiful vistas - gorgeously photographed in British Columbia by James Munro - are a soothing alternative in a season of movies seemingly aimed at sufferers of attention deficit disorder."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,75,A flawed but highly entertaining B Western blown up to John Ford scale.
Open Range,7.5,58331254,75,"There's nothing corny, however, about the climactic shoot-out, which Costner has staged superbly as an extended logistical mini-war that surges and rifle-cracks with bloody abandon through what feels like every building in town. Call it dances with guns."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,75,"Costner is always at his best when hes a little ornery, and Duvall is the same way. His grizzled performance is so thoroughly in character that he even chews as if it were 1882."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,75,"The scenario recalls everything from ""High Noon"" to ""Unforgiven,"" but Costner is less interested in grappling with the grim ambiguities underlying those films than in codifying them. There's still much to like, including the warm, thoughtful performances and cinematographer James Muro's fearless use of natural light."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,70,"Mostly it's just a good yarn, with attractive picture-postcard vistas and an agreeable strain of light humor."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,70,"In spite of its portentousness, the film does engage one."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,70,"When the picture's good, it's really something; when it's bad, you grit your teeth and pray it will end."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,70,"Though visually lovely and ambitious, never soars to the heights achieved by ""Unforgiven."" Costners film lacks the moral complexity that might earn it a solid berth in the canon of the American Western."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,67,"Compared with other films Costner has directed, Range isn't a folly like ""The Postman,"" nor is it quite as over-elaborated as ""Dances With Wolves."""
Open Range,7.5,58331254,67,"The screenplay of Open Range, credited to one Craig Storper, is an awesome compendium of cowboy-movie cliches. It borders on parody, and often crosses the border, rustling up a drove of oater aphorisms."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,63,"A better, and more relevant movie, might have left us at the point of troubled introspection, but Costner is compulsive about tying up loose ends and upbeat messages. If the climax of Open Range is disappointing, the ending is almost intolerable."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,63,"A blend of the classical and the trite, the beautiful and tawdry, the genuinely moving and the cornball. Oddly, producer-director-star Costner often can't seem to tell the difference."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,63,"Storper is pretty good at playing with and against certain western cliches in his treatment of the good guys (including Annette Bening's character), but resorts to pure cliche when it comes to the villians (e.g., Gambon and James Russo)."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,63,"While Costner the actor clearly imagines himself the Gary Cooper of the 21st century, he's got a crude sentimental streak that Costner the director fails to curtail."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,60,"Many sequences, many moments, are turned skillfully, and the look of the film is much of the time breathtaking. Yet, for its entire two hours and fifteen minutes, we merely watch it. It is there. We are here, regrettably objective."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,60,"Open Range veers wildly. It's a movie of beauty and sensitivity, and tedium and absurdity."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,60,"There's a fine little western lurking inside Open Range: Too bad it gets drowned out by director Kevin Costner's pretentiousness. Almost everything in the movie feels inflated, overblown, drawn out."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,50,"A moderate success, if a bit clunky. Somewhere beneath the syrupy melodrama and the scenes that should have expired long ago, there is an intelligent, thoughtful western in waiting."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,50,"In all, the film is a striking, if flawed, achievement by a talented actor who may become an important director if he sticks to the genre that suits him best."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,50,Open Range copies the rain and flood of the Clint Eastwood classic but can't match it for dark-night-of-the-soul brilliance.
Open Range,7.5,58331254,50,"Mr. Costner's relentless, root-canal humorlessness turns what might have been an enjoyable B-picture throwback into a ponderous drag."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,50,"Where ""Silverado"" swaggered, Open Range sulks; it's no fun at all."
Open Range,7.5,58331254,40,"Without Duvall, this movie would be as wet as Waterworld."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,80,"The actors are what save it. Not only does Johnson build on his subversive  persona of hulking, dim-witted likability,  but he’s joined by Neighbors’ Zac Efron, today’s reigning king of the hazy one-liner."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,70,Baywatch...is for those fans who couldn’t resist the show’s soapy charms. New ones who crave a summer blockbuster comedy might enjoy how much it not only owns its dumbness but hurtles itself all the way back around through a flurry of genitalia jokes and F-bombs to splash unapologetically in an R-rated surf of winking postmodernism.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,67,"Baywatch won’t blow anything out of the water (except for the boat it sets on fire), but it will certainly make a splash."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,60,"It’s the smart-ass nerd’s Baywatch. The movie is okay, though, if you don’t mind manic pacing and icky dick jokes."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,60,"Like its source material, Baywatch is sleazy and wholesome, silly and earnest, dumb as a box of sand and slyly self-aware. It’s soft-serve ice cream. Crinkle-cut fries. A hot car and a skin rash. Tacky and phony and nasty and also kind of fun."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"Like the show, it’s about an insanely attractive lifeguard crew whose members really throw themselves into their work. But the product teeters between absurdity and earnestness."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"Baywatch is a running gag in slow motion, a thong-in-cheek TV retread swapping wholesome jiggles for dirty giggles. There are places for such humor but beaches don't have gutters."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"You’ll find laughs, zaniness and plenty of signature slow-motion jiggling, but it’s buried under a burdensome two-hour procedural."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"For the most part, Baywatch resembles a scarce amount of its origin and relies on a none-too-arch humor that misses more than it hits."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,Baywatch should have been a lot more fun.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"The result is a scattershot comedy that only intermittently nails either tone, finally just bogging down in flatly choreographed mayhem in the late going."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"No cliché is left unturned, and Gordon compensates with slick action."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"Honestly, I’ve seen more narratively ambitious Mad Libs."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"After a sharp, satiric opening, though, Baywatch slowly sinks. The scenery is pretty, including the actors, but Johnson and Efron are better at making fun of themselves than landing zingers."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"This Baywatch has its share of hilarious moments but never fully commits to the absurd, and even the cleverest jokes get so many callbacks, they’re beating a dead seahorse."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"In terms of body objectification, Baywatch is an equal-opportunity exploiter, but when it comes to comedy, it's a total boys' club."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,The trouble is that the movie plays it boringly straight.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,48,Baywatch wastes its attractive cast on tired jokes and nothing.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,42,"In spoofing something so forgettable, they’ve made something even less memorable."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,42,"Its insistence on trying to balance wannabe sincerity and earnest actions with laughs is a tonally misconceived idea. Ultimately more forgettable then deplorable, Baywatch isn’t so much a disastrous spill in the ocean as it is disposable garbage making a mess."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,40,"Thank heaven for Dwayne Johnson, whose foot-wide smile will not be switched off, and who saves the life of the movie. Whether it deserves to be saved is another matter."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,40,"The plot doesn't quite sink Baywatch, but it sure slows it down."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,40,"As with any movie of this sort, there are a few laughs. Johnson is as likable an actor as there is, and it’s to the actors’ credit that they buy in to the stupidity. But there aren’t enough laughs and not nearly enough story."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,40,"Everything about Baywatch the movie is big, brash and bombastic."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,40,"Johnson and Efron possess impressive muscles, but the performers have never done as much heavy lifting as they do here. And to their credit, they succeed to some degree."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,38,"As it giggles away at its campy self, at least you can groan along with it."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,38,"It’s all just a day at the beach, harmlessly fun and instantly forgettable."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,38,"When you make films from junk TV, more often than not you’re going to wind up with a junk movie."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,38,"Baywatch is not nearly as good as this genre’s best entries, like 2012’s “21 Jump Street.” It washes up on the beach like a dead whale."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,38,"The movie is all preening and very few laughs, though Daddario and Efron have a few moments, and Johnson remains a supremely likable slab of movie star."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,38,"If you saw the trailer, you got the best the movie has to offer."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,38,"It’s a goof that isn’t goofy enough, a romp that doesn’t, and a tone-deaf riff on a show that was already a parody, in and of itself."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,30,"The movie is a minor crime, a meandering misdemeanor that’s neither soft-core nor hardcore but no core, with no consistent style and minimal content."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,30,Baywatch is surprisingly without sexism or condescension: It’s equal-opportunity stupid.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,30,"Baywatch’s comedy (credited to six different writers) is second-rate and its action is even worse, with special effects that rank among the absolute worst I’ve seen in a big summer movie in many years."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,30,"The film may pretend it’s more sophisticated than the show that spawned it, but its comedic stylings are alarmingly regressive."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,25,What little plot there is involves drug-running and is just about as disposable as everything in this paltry excuse for a movie.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,25,The waterlogged end product is an example of lazy writing and direction with the vague hope that perhaps the involvement of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson will attract viewers.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,25,"If anything, Baywatch is a litmus test for how low Johnson can sink while still winning us over."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,25,"When it comes down to it, Baywatch’s central sin is that it’s just…not funny."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,25,"There’s a severe tonal problem this movie never reconciles. It wants to be a self-aware, R-rated comedy and a straightforward action picture. At any moment, it’s one or the other but never both."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,25,"A summer franchise movie that can’t decide if it wants to be a hard-R bawdy comedy, a d-bag-comes-of-age tale or a fairly unironic reboot of the glossy TV show (which ran from 1989-2001), Baywatch fails at all three, despite the best efforts of the perennially game Johnson and Zac Efron."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,20,"What the director and writers have done is turn something that's considered by many to be dumb-but-fun into an overlong, unfunny film that's just plain dumb."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,20,Baywatch is a tonal mess of epic proportions.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,20,"Unfunny, unthrilling and unsexy, this doesn’t even reach the low bar set by the source material."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,20,"Tonally, Baywatch veers all over the place like a drunk on a speedboat, making for one of the most lacklustre comedies of the year so far."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,20,"By about halfway in, the gags dry up and the story sinks like an overweight tourist who took a dip too early after the all-you-can-eat surf ’n’ turf buffet."
Demolition Man,6.6,58055768,80,"If ever there was a movie equivalent to the one-night stand this is it - not necessarily something you'll remember next day but fast, furious and damn good fun while it lasts."
Demolition Man,6.6,58055768,75,"The pleasant surprise about Demolition Man is that both the script, and Stallone, are funny; the film blends big-budget action and tongue-in-cheek humor in the way that ""last action hero"" tried, and failed, to do."
Demolition Man,6.6,58055768,50,"The script is fueled by genuine wit, everyone turns in fine performances and, beginning to end, the film actually shows some thought, if little originality."
Demolition Man,6.6,58055768,40,Demolition Man is a futuristic cop picture with slightly more imagination and wit than the typical example of the slash-and-burn genre.
Demolition Man,6.6,58055768,40,Ultimately the script's often sharp social satire is drowned out by the noise and confusion.
Demolition Man,6.6,58055768,40,"Yes, this film is worse than ""Cliffhanger,"" Stallone's last venture into chaos."
Demolition Man,6.6,58055768,38,Demolition Man is sleek and empty as well as brutal and pointless.
Demolition Man,6.6,58055768,25,"Nearly all the SF premises are accorded the status of Andrew Dice Clay one-liners - which means that they, along with the characters, keep changing from one scene to the next."

The Chronicles of Riddick,6.7,57761012,67,"The pleasure of The Chronicles of Riddick comes mostly from the fascinating and outlandishly detailed production design, which sprawls across the screen in nearly every shot, with the Necromongers gigantic starships looking similar to those strange stone heads on Easter Island."

The Chronicles of Riddick,6.7,57761012,50,"Where ""Pitch Black"" relied on shadowy threats and sharply drawn relationships between a small group of stranded victims-to-be, Twohy's bloated space opera is an eye-popping three-ring circus of fabulously freaky costumes, over-ripe declaiming and computer-generated spectacle."
The Chronicles of Riddick,6.7,57761012,50,"Despite being positioned as a mold-breaker, Riddick now blends in with a sizable crowd of reluctant loner cinematic heroes, just as the movie fails to convince that it's going where no movie has gone before."

The Chronicles of Riddick,6.7,57761012,40,"As bloated and ponderous as its predecessor was lean and focused, Chronicles ups the stakes along with the budget while jettisoning just about everything that made ""Pitch Black"" stand out from other thrillers about weary humans battling nefarious space beasties."

The Chronicles of Riddick,6.7,57761012,38,"An overblown hodgepodge of volcano-baked desertscapes, Egyptoid-gone-baroque architecture, and gladiator-geared storm troopers with goofy headpieces, The Chronicles of Riddick bears no resemblance to the movie that spawned its namesake."

The Chronicles of Riddick,6.7,57761012,25,"Just about everything in The Chronicles of Riddick is impenetrable, from the convoluted story to the dark and baroque art direction. It's an inane film rendered sometimes laughable by an atmosphere of dead-serious reverence."

Takers,6.2,57744720,67,"The heist movie genre gets a hip-hop makeover in Takers, a movie loaded with as much style as ammunition."
Takers,6.2,57744720,63,"You could make a worse choice for a late- summer popcorn movie than Takers, a Michael Mann-ish heist thriller with a pulse-pounding foot chase and some terrific stunt work offsetting its hackneyed plot and dialogue."
Takers,6.2,57744720,63,"Noisy, unsubtle, but it gets the job done."
Takers,6.2,57744720,60,"The casting, from lead roles to supporting, is uniformly terrific."
Takers,6.2,57744720,50,"It runs the stopwatch on a chase sequence to a comical extreme and takes way, way too long to take its final bow, in the process burning off any residual goodwill."
Takers,6.2,57744720,50,"A respectable but watered-down heist movie that, given the Los Angeles setting, either owes a debt to director Michael Mann or suggests an unusually violent and action-packed episode of ""Entourage."""
Takers,6.2,57744720,50,"The performers are given stock types to play, and Elba and Dillon, at least, can do a little with that."
Takers,6.2,57744720,50,"The dialogue is clichéd and laughable. It's a film far more concerned with style - architectural, vehicular and wardrobe-related - than substance."
Takers,6.2,57744720,50,"There is plenty of nonsense, a great deal of stylish posturing and clothes-horsing, and a few action sequences that manage to be both gripping and preposterous."
Takers,6.2,57744720,50,The new heist movie Takers is surprisingly okay.
Takers,6.2,57744720,50,"After sitting through Takers with my stomach rearranged by hyperactive camera spazzing, I hereby formally request all directors and cinematographers to just get a grip already and STOP. WIGGLING. THE CAMERA."
Takers,6.2,57744720,45,It comes to the party overdressed and still fails to make an impression.
Takers,6.2,57744720,42,At least they do look sharp in those suits.
Takers,6.2,57744720,38,"Takers might have made a perfectly decent little B heist movie, but someone had to go and forget to give the cameraman his Ritalin."
Takers,6.2,57744720,30,"Did I mention the dialogue? Well, really the armored car driver put it best when he said, ""We're in trouble here…"" No joke."
Takers,6.2,57744720,25,"Rapper, producer, and mogul Tip ""T.I."" Harris was recently named ""global creative consultant"" for Rémy Martin cognac. Coincidentally or not, he's also the star and producer of Takers, a heist thriller that feels suspiciously like a feature-length commercial for expensive liquor."
Takers,6.2,57744720,20,"What helps salvage the film (much to the surprise of director and co-writer Lussenhop and his fellow writers Peter Allen, Gabriel Casseus and Avery Duff) are the unintentional laughs generated by the film's outrageous gun battles, childish dialogue and an action chase featuring Brown that seems to go on forever."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,80,"An obligatory setup for a sequel slows down the final moments, but until then, Tomb Raider feels like a perfectly paced trio of espresso shots, with a shot of adrenaline to the heart as a chaser."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,75,Much better and more original than anyone could have expected.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,75,Director Roar Uthaug (“The Wave”) delivers a state-of-the-art popcorn flick that’s at its best when the focus is on the spunky Lara rather than the special effects.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,75,"Uthaug also manages to work in a few genuinely cool visual tricks, though the dialogue, from a serviceable script by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons is strictly standard; a mix of clunky action-movie exposition and winking Indiana Jones-style humor."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,70,"This movie is a smooch-free zone, and the arc described by its leading lady, proud and nerveless, is an elegant one: she starts by taking a punch to the face, without malice, from another woman, and, at the climax, delivers one herself—unmanning her male opponent with a decisive thump to the groin. If Lara Croft weren’t already a role model, she is now."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,70,"The fights and chases are well designed. You can always tell where everything is in relation to everything else and who’s hitting or shooting whom — which isn’t a given, surprisingly, when fast cutting and loudness can cover a lot of infelicities."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,70,"It's hardly the first or last time Hollywood has plundered one of its own long-dormant properties, but it's also a reminder that not every resurrection has to feel like a desecration."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,70,"The movie is full of vine-swinging, bow-and-arrow-shooting, ancient-spirit-meeting action, but most of it is staged on a convincing human scale, one that’s been expertly tailored to its star’s understated directness."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,67,"This new iteration of Ms. Croft, played in a far more realistic fashion by Vikander (of Ex Machina fame), is somewhat more serious in tone, but altogether more fun to watch."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,67,"Vikander is a beautifully effective avatar for the American Ninja Warrior version of Lara Croft. Stripping down the bombast of the original games (and films) allows Uthaug’s reboot to feel comparatively grounded and immediate, without dragging itself down with unnecessary pathos."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,63,"Tomb Raider may be the most faithful adaptation of a video game to-date. Unfortunately, faithfulness to the source material doesn’t always result in the best cinematic experience and this is one of those occasions."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,63,"Tomb Raider may be a less camp, more cunning take on the arts and Crofts that have made the brand a hit, but to call this a better-than average videogame movie is to damn it with faint praise. Don't hate the players. Hate the genre."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,63,"Vikander doesn’t have much to play, script-wise, but she makes a tough, appealing action star."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,63,"Tomb Raider is an often fun and visually compelling action pic, that is also sometimes unintentionally silly, with a great actress leading the whole thing."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,60,"I admire the seriousness with which everyone involved treats these characters, and the smart ways that the script (from Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons) on several occasions dashes expectations to the rocks. I have hopes for a sequel."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,60,"Tomb Raider, by merely being an OK video-game film, is a great step in the right direction for the struggling genre. It seems that Uthaug got most of the dreary, expositional stuff out of the way early, so hopefully these oncoming sequels will take a hint and give audiences more of what they want."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,60,"Alicia Vikander makes for a scrappy, spunky Lara Croft, even if the overall concept remains less a movie and more of an exercise routine."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,60,"For all of Tomb Raider’s strengths, it would still be a stretch to call it a good movie. It’s diverting, a good way to spend a couple of hours, but it’s hamstrung by something that’s unavoidable: The whole central concept — raiding tombs — is just, well, not that interesting."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,60,"More than the sets or spectacle, Vikander pulls you into her picture, as if we’ve signed up for a special edition of the game where Lara Croft has only one life to spare, one go to get it right. It’s not rocket science, just an elementary way to make us sit up and care."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,60,"Norway’s Roar Uthaug (The Wave) directs it straight up, without even a twist of humour, bouncing Vikander from set piece to set piece with no real attempt at coherent plotting in-between. Yet Vikander is so watchable as the video-game-made-flesh, and the low-fi chase sequences can be so exciting, it’s almost enough. Almost."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,60,Vikander packs a punch but this Tomb Raider is a long way off the Holy Grail of the first three Indy movies.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,58,"When Tomb Raider digs into its more creative action, it’s about as entertaining as popcorn entertainment gets these days. It’s when the film falls back on the old tropes that things grind to a halt."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,58,"Vikander doesn’t do much with a character whose chief attribute is earnestness, but Tomb Raider improves once it gets to the island and lets the derring-do take over."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,55,Tomb Raider fails to develop interesting characters or motives but at least offers viewers some fun action.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,55,"Since the genre of video games-turned-into-feature films has inflicted some real doozies on audiences, Tomb Raider towers above most of its peers by being merely OK. By any other measure, this is a saga of fits and starts, and we can only hope for smoother sailing if the film inspires the sequels it clearly hopes to engender."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"Tomb Raider, sloppily directed by Roar Uthaug, would not be worth watching without Vikander, who darts, leaps, and pummels her way through this mediocre escapade with a winning fierceness that makes you wish she had paired up with Indiana Jones in his heyday."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"Vikander, who can balance flinty charm with sympathetic humanism, helped keep me invested, but Tomb Raider could best be described as a solid step forward, away from past wrongs. I’ll take competence over silliness, but the Lara Croft brand still has a long way to go before her movies are truly memorable."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"Outside of Vikander’s performance, Tomb Raider tends to go on autopilot, either too scared or uninspired to reimagine this blah action-adventure material."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"The emotional underpinnings of the story feel incomplete, to the extent that the film is too busy with death-defying survival scenes and pointed guns to truly reckon with Lara’s abandonment as a child."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"Vikander is in nearly every scene in the movie, and she’s absolutely terrific. Endearing and funny in the early scenes in London, easy to root for as she dives into the cartoon of an adventure. Of course Tomb Raider sets the table for future adventures, but if the future chapters are to be this silly and disposable, one hopes Vikander moves on as quickly from this film as I did as a viewer."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"Like the personality-devoid video-game version of Croft, Vikander’s take is bland. Like the game, the movie develops her skills and stamina more than her personality, leaving Croft to be a kind of blank slate so viewers can attach their own identity. While that works in games because characters are avatars for players, Uthaug’s apparent use of a similar technique here is tedious."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"The action set pieces are hit and miss, mostly not the worst thing I’ve ever seen, and if there’s one thing Tomb Raider is actually good at, it’s giving death more gravity than you usually see in these kinds of movies, where faceless henchmen are dispatched with nary a second thought. For the most part, though, Tomb Raider is content to be the kind of movie that reminds you of other movies without differentiating itself from them."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"When it comes to what should be the reliably dumb fun of tomb raiding, maybe there are worse crimes than insulting viewers’ intelligence or bombarding them with crappy special effects. Boring them? Now that’s a felony offense."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,The Lara Croft reboot Tomb Raider isn’t half bad for an hour. Then there’s another hour. That hour is quite bad.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"Lara’s appealing enough in humor and drive but Vikander brings deeper notes than the script and green screens require, from sorrow and fear to first-kill horror. Tomb Raider isn’t a place to expect good acting even from an Oscar winner, but Vikander persists."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,40,All the action leads inexorably toward the unavoidable destination.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,40,"It’s a different kind of Tomb Raider, certainly. But for an adventure film, it’s disconcertingly dull."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,40,"Brandishing impressively packed abs and enough upper body strength to pull herself out of countless jams, Alicia Vikander gamely steps into the kick-ass role twice played by Angelina Jolie, but the derivative story and cardboard supporting characters are straight out of 1930s movie serials."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,40,"Too bad the new actress doesn’t bring much to the party, and this “origin story” feels like leftovers."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,40,"To her credit, Vikander works hard and looks the part. She also has some chemistry with Daniel Wu, who plays the guy who helps Lara get to the island and then sort of becomes her sidekick.... By the standards of video game movies, Tomb Raider is not terrible, but by the standards of video game movies Plan 9 From Outer Space is practically an Oscar winner."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,40,Throughout Vikander maintains a kind of serene evenness of manner. Blandness is Lara’s theme.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,38,"After a brisk and promising opening half-hour set in London and Hong Kong, the movie devolves into a Saturday matinee B-movie, and not in a good way. It’s pure product, and a waste of a savvy leading actress."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,38,A film so rife with plot holes that it would make a decent pasta strainer.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,38,"Alicia Vikander worked herself into hardbody shape for Tomb Raider, which by contrast is a flabby, lazy mess."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,38,"When your set pieces fail to surprise, your dialogue fails to deliver even one decent one-liner and your villain looks like he’s dealing with dysentery on location, maybe 17-18 years isn’t long enough between reboots."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,37,"Norwegian director Roar Uthaug has had past success with nail-biting suspense, as in his well-received 2015 disaster movie “The Wave.” He can’t quite replicate that same tension here, however. Watching a tiny-but-tough woman survive one danger after another tests not only our credulity, but our patience."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,30,"While I wasn’t exactly expecting greatness from the film, I did think it would contain a few thrills and maybe some laughs. Having Lara Croft leap around and avoid traps should be an easy formula—but for this crew, it remains an unsolvable puzzle."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,30,"There are many ways for a movie to go wrong, and Tomb Raider goes wrong in many of the most obvious: It has a generic story, bad writing, a miscast lead, the wrong director and no fun."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,25,"Story problems tank the new Tomb Raider — small, essential things like lack of motivation, lack of reasons for people to do the things they do, and lack of any reason for the audience to keep watching."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,25,"Unexceptionally directed by Roar Uthaug (Norwegian hit “The Wave“), Tomb Raider is superficial even for a mainstream tentpole, clumsily and unpersuasively put together and tests and breaks suspension of disbelief at every turn."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,25,This isn’t an adaptation of a video game so much as an adaptation of a video game’s tutorial level.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,10,"Ms. Vikander has leapt into the void of a franchise reboot, based on a video-game reboot, that generates no joy, makes negligible sense, and seals its own tomb with a climax of perfect absurdity."
Willow,7.3,57269863,63,"Its pacing is too deliberate, and it doesn’t have a light heart. That’s revealed in the handling of some characters named the Brownies, represented by a couple of men who are about 9 inches tall and fight all the time. Maybe Lucas thought these guys would work like R2-D2 and C-3PO did in “Star Wars.” But they have no depth, no personalities, no dimension; they’re simply an irritant at the edge of the frame."
Willow,7.3,57269863,63,"Built on fantasy stereotypes – friendly little folk, evil witches, misunderstood heroes, guys on horseback with bloody great swords – it nonetheless contains enough epic action, narrative momentum and spit-and-sawdust pre-CGI special effects to hold the attention."
Willow,7.3,57269863,60,"Every aspect of WILLOW seems as if it were written in stone before a shot was filmed. The plot grinds on inescapably to its predictable climax, with the viewer fully aware of what awaits long before the events unfold."
Willow,7.3,57269863,60,"Willow is medieval mishmash from George Lucas, a sort of 10th-century ""Star Wars"" tossed together with a plethora of elements taken from numerous classic fables. Even if Lucas has bastardized his own story with derivative and unoriginal elements, kids probably will love it. For MGM Pictures, b.o. should mean recoupment of its large investment."
Willow,7.3,57269863,60,"This is pretty much the Lucas mixture as usual, this time in a Tolkien mode, with everything from the Old Testament to Kurosawa to Disney fed into a blender and turned into wallpaper. For easy-to-please five-year-olds of all ages."
Willow,7.3,57269863,60,"Producer-for-Life George Lucas puts his awesome creative machinery to work in Willow, a would-be adventure of little people, big people, good guys and bad. But the fantasy wheels grind to a halt, bogged down in Lucas' flat, derivative story, and not helped in the least by director Ron Howard's clumsy steering."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,75,"Like its precursor, U.S. Marshals has lots of action and the Jones groupies are likeable. Though the overall picture isn't as fine-tuned or character driven, it still delivers what moviegoers want to see - a fast-paced and entertaining chase."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,70,A movie that knows how to pace its audience. Watching it is like going for a long and satisfying jog.
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,70,"Although this film doesn't have the classy quality of The Fugitive, it certainly goes down like an action milkshake. And Jones, one of the most enjoyable actors on the screen, plays himself to the hilt."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,67,"Efficient, uninspired sequel."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,63,I like that Sheridan's girlfriend works at Starbucks. Snipes plays the part with the kind of high energy that large doses of caffeine would explain.
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,63,"The result is unconvincing and disorganized. Yes, there are some spectacular stunts and slick special effects sequences. Yes, Jones is right on the money, and Snipes makes a sympathetic fugitive. But it's the story that has to pull this train, and its derailment is about as definitive as the train crash in the earlier film."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,63,Who really wants to go to an escape movie and have to work this hard to figure it out?
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,63,"The action sequences were often nail-biters, the lead characters were well-developed, and the dialogue was intelligent."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,50,"Ironically, the problem may lie in Baird and screenwriter John Pogue's over-eagerness to give us what they think we want."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,50,"It isn't so much a bad action movie as a symptom of the greater problem with most action movies: Audiences tire of sitting through the same fitful, unfulfilling formula, no matter how much terse language and gunfire is tossed in."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,50,Go see it. But you'll feel cheap in the morning.
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,50,"Not so much a sequel to ""The Fugitive"" as a lazy spin-off that imitates only what was boring and artificially frenetic about that earlier thriller; the little that kept it interesting."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,50,"Generic, uninspired and devoid of suspense."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,40,"To make the package look fresh, there's a pile of complications."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,40,"Stuart Baird's new thriller is inferior to the Andrew Davis movie in every respect: script, acting, rhythm and even tech credits."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,40,"By the time it winds down, U.S. Marshals has all but destroyed itself. It's gone pffft! in the night."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,40,Going after one innocent man was bad enough. Going after another constitutes a pattern. This marshal isn't a hero. He's a menace.
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,40,It's impossible to find an iota of aesthetic worth or an ounce of pleasure in this sludge.
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,70,"A mish-mash of accents (buffoonish Depardieu's French, somber Irons' British, and DiCaprio and Malkovich carrying the same voices they use for every project) are vaguely unsettling, and there seems to be too little swashbuckling for characters who are synonymous with the term."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,70,"An unusually sober and serious-minded telling of Alexandre Dumas' classic tale, this handsome costumer is routinely made and comes up rather short in boisterous excitement."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,67,"Wallace, unfortunately, writes lazy, anachronistic dialogue, and the picture is abysmally shot (by Peter Suschitzky), with a prosaic, low-budget look that never allows you to experience the enraptured majesty of a fairy-tale historical setting."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,63,"I could see how, with a rewrite and a better focus, this could have been a film of ""Braveheart'' quality instead of basically just a costume swashbuckler."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,63,"The result is the kind of picture you can sit through quite contentedly, the cinematic equivalent of an innocuous seatmate on an airplane trip -- it neither bores nor insults you, and, when the ride's over, is promptly gone and forgotten."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,63,"The problem with this movie is that Wallace has attempted to squeeze a 500-page book into a 130-minute motion picture, something that can't be done without major sacrifices."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,60,"Beyond its persistent coarseness, Wallace's story often trades yesterday's inspiration (Dumas) for today's (Simpson-Bruckheimer)."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,60,"Heavy on swordplay and spectacle, it's so intent on reviving the costume epics of the past it doesn't realize it's trying to be too many things to too many people until it collapses under its own weight."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,50,"Thoroughly second-rate -- which is to say that it waddles when it ought to whiz, clanks when it strives for cornball poetry, and transforms its august stars into something akin to a manic dinner-theater troupe."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,50,"The only other adaptations I've seen of the Alexandre Dumas novel (which I haven't read) are the Classics Illustrated comic book and the 1939 James Whale potboiler, both of which I prefer to this vulgar and overwrought 1998 free-for-all, which makes you wait interminably for the story's central narrative premise."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,50,"Going down with the Titanic was a picnic compared to what Leonardo DiCaprio has to weather (an Alice in Wonderland hairdo, for starters) as Louis XIV in this unwittingly nutso adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' 1850 novel."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,50,There is nothing worth getting steamed over or particularly excited about.
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,50,"Viewers expecting rip-roaring, chandelier- swinging swordplay adventure are likely to be disappointed by the measured tone and portentous verbal interplay."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,50,"Leonardo DiCaprio? Excuse me, Leonardo DiCaprio? I know he makes teenaged girls cry, but, I mean, Leonardo DiCaprio?"
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,40,"This dopey swashbuckler offers little action but lashings of DiCaprio's soft, hairless flesh."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,40,"This new chronicle of the adventures of the king's musketeers, as directed by Braveheart scribe Randall Wallace, suffers from a severe case of over-earnestness and star-power overkill."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,40,"The Three Musketeers, a rusty trio of middle-aged retirees, have all but changed their motto from ""All for one and one for all"" to ""I have fallen and I can't get up"" in this less-than-rollicking adaptation."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,10,"Not 10 minutes into the smeary mess that is The Man in the Iron Mask, the only sensible question to ask yourself is, ""What am I doing here?"""
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,100,"As irresistible as Chan is irrepressible. In a movie season in which, it seems, all the blockbusters boast wheels, it's a treat to see a movie that has legs."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,90,"Jackie Chan's best American picture to date, breathes fresh life into the virtually dormant comedy-western."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,90,"Unstintingly funny -- far more so than the wince-worthy trailer -- owing to Chan's pairing with droll indie eccentric Owen Wilson, as his would-be gunslinger sidekick."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,90,"This enjoyable East-meets-Western likely will succeed on its own terms as a sure-fire, long-legged crowd-pleaser."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,90,"It's an inspired pairing. Wilson is electric as he seduces Chan into a partnership in this self-consciously crafted western, whose cleverness is only part of what makes it so funny."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,90,"He's (Wilson) a terrific sidekick to Chan's funny, earnest, often victimized righteousness. This kid could be a star."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,90,"Childishly simple, but extremely funny."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,90,"A refreshing movie that's so good natured, so confident of its ability to provoke not queasy awe or numb exhaustion but pure delight."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,90,"There's plenty of invention and exuberant vigor in the chopsocky, and Wilson's cool, ironic drollery provides the perfect foil for Chan's heroics."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,88,The film is still a wonderful lark filled with an ingredient most summer blockbusters lack -- likability.
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,83,Jackie Chan's latest teams him up in 1880s America with Owen Wilson -- and gives a giddy glimpse of what he'll be doing after he gets too old to do his death-defying stunts.
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,80,"Lets Jackie Chan have some fun, ride a horse and frolic in the American West. And when Jackie's having fun, at least some of it trickles down to us."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,80,"This is almost Mel Brooks territory: The frontiersmen think the Chinese are Jews, while the white settlers think it's the Crow Indians who are. Whoosh!"
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,75,This is one of the few recent westerns that requires you to keep your eyes open and memory engaged.
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,75,The martial arts wizard shows a nice feel for the Butch and Sundance thing.
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,75,"If you see only one martial arts Western this year (and there is probably an excellent chance of that), this is the one."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,75,This one looks like a sure bet for seven weeks (at least) of audience good fortune.
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,75,"He (Chan) still can turn a silly little action comedy like this into a high-spirited, butt-kicking good time."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,75,"The first hit movie western of the new century - wins us with a wink. It leaves you in a bright, happily cross-cultural mood. Adios, amigos. And vaya con Jackie Chan."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,75,Funny enough that it could make buddy pictures respectable again.
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,75,"The most enjoyable western comedy since ""Blazing Saddles."""
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,75,"A modest pleasure, driven by a jumble of Old West signifiers and goofball modern flourishes."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,70,"It's Wilson's film all the way. He's brings an unexpected frisson of surfer-esque chutzpah to the role of Roy, a bad guy with good intentions, a cowboy who, dammit, just wants to be loved."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,67,"A silly buddy caper that should delight the adolescent at heart, even if some of the jokes have been sitting too long in the desert sun."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,63,"A trifle at best, a lightweight, wink-wink amalgam of myriad other films, some of which have even starred Chan and Wilson."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,60,"Given a decent script, they might make a fun summer movie. Given the script for Shanghai Noon, they've come up with a middling Old West oater that falls flat at least as often as it finds the funny bone."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,55,"Lacks confidence in its own much bigger, potentially fascinating story -- an American tale of pageantry and history."
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,50,Chan's string of chop-socky films were never boring.  Shanghai Noon is.
Shanghai Noon,6.6,56937502,50,"It's too bad screenwriters Gough and Millar didn't have enough faith in their premise to play it straight; if they had, they might have produced a classic rather than a ""Blazing Saddles"" without the courage of its convictions."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,80,"Smart, wry and awesome, all at once."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,80,"What ensues is never exactly unpredictable, but always witty, fresh and fun."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,80,"Actually lighter, wittier, and more original than it has a right to be."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,80,"Savvy without being smug, cute without being saccharin, and funny without slipping into over-the-top goofiness, this is a 14th-century good time."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,80,"Though the picture is definitely flawed, it maintains a joie de vivre that's surprisingly refreshing."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,"A Knight's Tale, will either repel you or win you over. It won me over."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,"With its cheerful hailstorm of anachronisms and classic-rock soundtrack, there's nothing medieval about it."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,"More often than not, it's fun."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,"It's a reminder of the days before films got so cynical and unrelentingly violent. A Knight's Tale is whimsical, silly and romantic."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,Simply a jolly good (k)night out.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,It's a dumb summer movie done with smarts.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,70,The action scenes are beautifully mounted and photographed and offer a sense of the rigors of the sport.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,70,"Smirking at the audacity of it all is part of the fun, and if nothing else, A Knight's Tale is a hell of a lot of fun."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,70,Fine family entertainment.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,70,"There's much to love about this ""Rocky"" on horseback, and those laughable blemishes just fold into jokes that Helgeland likely intends audiences to laugh at."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,67,"The result is half Python, half Ivanhoe--and not as much fun as either."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,63,Would be sweeter if the fair maiden weren't such a pill and more exciting if the villain weren't quite so nasty.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,63,"The picture itself is good-humored, but bland and predictable. It's a cross between an All-American vaudevillian version of ""Shakespeare in Love"" and Mel Brooks's ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights."""
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,63,"Laddish, one joke, genre scrambling rock & roll fairy tale."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,63,"For all its hipness, the movie serves up some awfully old chestnuts."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,60,"From the moment he trudges through the woods in his scratched and smudged birthday suit, Paul Bettany as a saucy Geoffrey Chaucer takes command."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,60,"This brazen mix of old and new is undermined by the predictable story, shallow characterizations and a dopey sense of humor."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,60,"As advertised, A Knight's Tale does try to rock you. The problem is, it doesn't rock you nearly enough."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,58,Works neither as an exuberant rock 'n' roll picture nor as a heroic fable. It will rock you --straight to sleep.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,50,"At best harmless, if not quite fun."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,50,The result is as flat as a year-old beer commercial.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,50,"Traditionalists and older viewers in general will scoff, while pop culture addicts will no doubt go with the flow."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,50,"The film's one saving grace is Ledger (Mel Gibson's son in ""The Patriot"")."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,40,"The skits are dreadful, the jokes suck."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,80,"Everything about Executive Decision is familiar except how crisply its conventional story is executed. Since most action thrillers think blowing things up is enough to attract an audience, it's a nice surprise to come across a savvy piece of work that relies on suspense and is as professional as the elite anti-terrorist unit it celebrates."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,80,"Ultimately, it’s the film’s sly irony that sets it a notch above similar actioners. The Thomas brothers’ script repeatedly draws us down dead-end alleys only to reverse expectations and top white-knuckle situations with thrilling conclusions."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,75,"I think what I like most about Executive Decision is that director Baird constantly tries to top himself. A more experienced director would have ended the film a few crises earlier. But Baird goes for broke in his directing debut, and the result is a most entertaining movie."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,75,"It's the kind of thriller where it's fun to chortle over the plot--a movie for people who are sophisticated enough to know how shameless the film is, but fun-loving enough to enjoy its excesses and manic zeal."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,75,"Writers Jim and John Thomas and first-time director Stuart Baird have come up with a surprisingly deft variation on the airplane hijack genre, one that relies on subterfuge and suspense rather than explosives and body counts even though Steven Seagal is in it."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,70,"The escalating tension largely compensates for the lack of character involvement, and the climax will have you reaching for your safety belt."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,70,"A good, taut movie for red-meat action audiences, but it's not one you will be seeing on an airliner. Not ever."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,70,"If you're looking for satisfying junk food, Executive Decision is exactly the carryout you've been craving. This hijacking suspense drama steals shamelessly from Tom Clancy's kitchen, but it's tautly scripted, loaded with tension and interspersed with great comic relief."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,67,"Just when you're about to give up on this seemingly sorry excuse for an action movie, the picture does an about-face in a matter of minutes, and pushes the tension level way into overdrive and transforms suddenly into a solidly entertaining thriller."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,63,"The acting is all first base, the script a laughable stream of gung ho-isms, the action merely solid and the effects indifferent. Yet, you still stroll out with a grin a mile wide."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,63,Such a bluntly impersonal thriller that the title might almost be describing the production honcho who greenlighted yet another Die Hard clone.
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,63,"Competently directed by respected film editor Stuart Baird, it's a glossy production with plenty of Things That Go Boom, courtesy of producer/demolition expert Joel Silver."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,63,This is a Seagal movie without Seagal and a Jack Ryan movie without Jack Ryan.
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,63,"Unfortunately, Stuart Baird's direction is so sluggish and Jim and John Thomas' script so padded that Executive Decision has no build. Instead of focusing on the mechanics of suspense, the film concentrates to a boyish extent on mechanics, period."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,80,"Tombstone is incredibly entertaining. While not entirely original and not always well executed, it manages to keep your attention for the entire 130-minute duration. And let's face it, Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday is what really sets it apart."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,75,"Tombstone remains a shamelessly entertaining movie, filled with lively turns from virtually every appropriate actor not working on the Costner version."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,75,"Tombstone is a tough-talking but soft-hearted tale that is entertaining in a sprawling, old-fashioned manner."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,75,A few stirring shoot-'em-ups help relieve the logjam of cliches. Director George P. (Rambo) Cosmatos does an OK job at the O.K. Corral. But even the good stuff goes on for too long.
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,70,"Kilmer makes a surprisingly effective and effete Holliday, but Russell lacks the stature for Earp - Sam Elliott as his older brother Virgil suggests a better movie. There's a misguided romantic subplot and the ending rather sprawls, but mostly this is rootin', tootin' entertainment with lots of authentic facial hair."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,63,"Highly stylized fashion-wise but awkwardly unfocused in its plotlines, it aims for the western iconography of Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone but never gets past its own directorial hurdles."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,63,Tombstone is a movie that wants to have it both ways. It wants to be at once traditional and morally ambiguous. The two visions don't quite harmonize.
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,60,"Though apparently conceived as a revisionist Western, Tombstone falls prey to the cliches of the genre, and its last third is a muddle."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,60,"This has plenty of designer gore to go with its periodic spurts of bloodletting, and a lot of care and attention were obviously devoted to selecting locations, designing sets, and grooming handlebar mustaches. Much less attention went to making one believe that any of the events took place circa 1879, but at least the bursts of action keep coming, and most survive Cosmatos's addiction to smoldering close-ups."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,50,"If only director George P. Cosmatos (Rambo) knew how to do something with cliches other than throw them into the pot and stir. A preposterously inflated 135 minutes long, Tombstone plays like a three-hour rough cut that’s been trimmed down to a slightly shorter rough cut."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,50,Doesn't really cut it in the Western genre.
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,50,"As much as these actors heroically struggle to focus the film, the director more successfully hacks it apart. But if you really love Westerns, despite its faults, it's got to be recommended for Kilmer's performance alone."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,100,Excellent.
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,89,"The movie gets goofy from time to time -- as when payola arrives in a vintage ""Clash of the Titans lunchbox -- but the filmmakers and cast have the style and the swagger to back it up."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,80,"Make no mistake, this movie is a mess. But, wow, what a mess! It's an exploding piñata, full of low comedy and high drama, deliriously colorful fight scenes and vehicle chases."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,80,Proves to be a whiz-bang kick in the pants.
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,80,"It's an exercise in style by Robert Rodriguez and not to be taken any more (or less) seriously than his giddy ""Spy Kids"" movies."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,80,"Affectionately conceived, imaginatively staged and highly entertaining."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,75,"In its wildly overwrought, burrito-Western way, is about as close to a home movie as you're likely to see in a megaplex."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,75,You don't want to miss Depp in this movie -- he knocks it out of the park.
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,75,"I understood the general outlines of the story, I liked the bold strokes he uses to create the characters, and I was amused by the camera work, which includes a lot of shots that are about themselves."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,75,"It's the addition of Depp's corrupt CIA agent, Sands, that really makes this violent, over-the-top action film, with its maze-like plot, sing."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,75,"Rodriguez is such a visual stylist, and the violence is so cartoonish, that the flurry of whizzing bullets and growing pile of bodies is not as offensive as it might be."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,75,A bloody fairy tale with no moral and a lot of juice.
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,70,"God bless Johnny Depp. For the second time this year, the man has almost single-handedly redeemed an action movie that would otherwise be indistinguishable from the pack."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,70,"The movie is stolen by the gorgeous, droll and hilarious Depp. The movie crackles when he's onscreen and only fitfully sparks when he's not."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,70,"Evokes the mythic feel of Sergio Leone Westerns. Despite a convoluted plot that begs for cleaner lines, the wild shoot-outs, cartoonish violence and charismatic cast should lure action fans to theaters."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,67,"You ride along with a movie like this with a big, dumb grin on your face and no guilt. Not one of this summer's megabucks movies felt this frisky or fun."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,63,"An epic unhinged, and while its best sections suggest a Loony Tune done by Sam Peckinpah and Emilio Fernandez, ""Mexico"" needs to be even crazier than it is."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,63,"If not exactly epic, the movie is certainly the biggest and most complex of Rodriguez's Mariachi trilogy, which began in ""El Mariachi"" and continued in ""Desperado."""
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,63,"Starts having the same effect as one too many tequilas: the Hong Kong-style stunts, the goofy wisecracks, the foxy presence of Eva Mendes -- all of it becomes blurry and numbing."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,63,"It's a grisly, chuckling cartoon made on shots of tequila, Red Bull, and Sergio Leone."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,60,Banderas inhabits the role of the mariachi with a feral grace undimished by the seven-year gap between films.
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,50,"However many millions of dollars Rodriguez set aside for blanks and exploding squibs was a waste. Depp's salary, on the other hand, was money well spent."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,50,"Paying homage to Sergio Leone, ""Mexico"" aims too high and, in the process, becomes more like every generic, overplotted drug-cartel-and-revenge flick out there."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,50,A clear case of huevos con hubris.
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,50,If only there had been more Salma Hayek.
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,50,The entire film is a thrown-together collection of gunfights and in-jokes. The film is more concerned with expanding this universe of seedy tequila bars and dusty city streets than it is in telling a narrative story.
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,40,An overstuffed would-be epic.
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,40,"Having already looted the Peckinpah and spaghetti-western archives, the director now quotes his own quotations, in service of not a sequel but a vociferous reiteration."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,40,"Depp's performance reminds us that, yeah, it's only a movie -- just not a good one."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,38,Needs a story.
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,30,"The only thing missing is a coherent story -- or even, for that matter, an interesting idea for one."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,30,The result is a dull and campy 97-minute bloodbath offering little distinction between good guys and bad.
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,30,"The whole movie is like that: showy stunts, explosions, over-the-top acting, fiesta colors, lurid angles, and a sense of nothing--nada--at stake."
Once Upon a Time in Mexico,6.4,56359780,25,"The film's deliberately overblown cartoonishness and its gleefully pandering adolescent cruelty never blend into the enjoyable style of, say, a good spaghetti western (Rodriguez's acknowledged model), or even a bad Quentin Tarantino movie."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,70,"As effective and fat-free as its sinewy star, Luke Evans, Dracula Untold proves an absorbing, swiftly comprehensive origin tale."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,70,"Dracula Untold is a dumb, lowest-common-denominator kind of movie, but it’s a surprisingly entertaining one. It’s brisk, which counts for a lot in this overbaked genre. The action is directed with verve and imagination — and it’s all gorgeously bleak, with black clouds of bats whipping around remote, craggy castles beneath portentous Carpathian skies."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,63,"Dracula Untold is a movie that gives good trailer. That's not surprising because it's a visually arresting saga. Unfortunately, the story in the final, full version is thicker than blood."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,63,"The good news barely outweighs the bad in Dracula Untold, a lightweight war-adventure that is ultimately stranger and more enticing when it remembers it's also a horror film."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,63,"Vlad’s numerous speeches about love, honor and family grow tedious, along with the film’s wooden dialogue in general. And it quickly becomes obvious that Dracula Untold is more interested in being cool than making sense."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,60,"If they had to give Drac an “origin story” this literal-minded, at least they had the sense to keep it keen and lively, whittled to a point."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,58,"He's a romantic and a psychopath and creature of the night. Sadly, Dracula Untold, with its humorless aura and been-there-done-that feel, doesn't allow Evans to inhabit many of these aspects. Instead, Dracula Untold feels largely uninspired."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,50,At times Dracula Untold flirts with dullness so much that it might as well just stick a stake in the heart of Bram Stoker's legacy.
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,50,"Instead of being respectful of Bram Stoker's creation, it attempts to remake him as a tragic figure with superhero powers."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,50,"No campy vampire movie, and the early part of the film is well-made enough that the sadness of Vlad’s dilemma is truly felt."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,50,"More sad dad and noble martyr than creature of the night, Evans’ dashing Prince Of Darkness inspires less fear than just about any incarnation of the famous character, save perhaps the one played by Leslie Nielsen."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,50,It works neither as a sweeping historical epic nor as an action-horror hybrid.
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,50,"Charles Dance is the Nosferatu-garbed monster in the cave, a balding, toothy villain in the great tradition of British vampires — Christopher Lee, Gary Oldman, Michael Sheen and Kate Beckinsale among them. The moment he shows up, all shadowy menace and prophecy, “Dracula” gets interesting."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,40,"For about the first hour of its running time, Dracula Untold is far too restrained and tasteful, and it certainly suffers from its tediously noble hero; it's well made but fatally lacking in thrills or excitement."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,40,"Aside from Dance and some hazy views of impaled bodies, the film is low on shock and gore. It's aiming more for sweeping historical epic, but it doesn't work on either level."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,40,Looking for plausibility in a movie called Dracula Untold is as pointless as looking for humor or personality in Mr. Evans’s dour performance.
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,40,"The CGI — mostly Evans transforming into fightin’ bats — look muddy and cheap, but the weapons, Turkish helmets and Romanian interiors are all gorgeous. If only the rest of this “Lord of the Rings” wanna-be were at the same level."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,40,"Too much of the last hour is a muddle of unconvincing, hard-to-read nighttime action scenes."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,40,"It’s no-frills, B-movie modesty might have been winning, if it weren’t so dashed-off."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,40,"Armour-clanging, cloak-swishing tosh with okay battles, terrible dialogue and sadly little horror or heroism. Nowhere near as bad as I, Frankenstein – but what is?"
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,38,This toothless attempt is just dead on arrival.
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,38,"The origins story Dracula Untold is Dracula unbold — unoriginal, unimaginative and utterly non-unprecedented. This Vlad the Impaler has all the edge of Vlasic the pickle."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,37,The film isn’t awful. There are moments of handsome cinematography and occasional effects that both frighten and impress.
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,30,"Dracula Untold boldly attempts to retell the Dracula origin story by sinking its teeth into Bram Stoker’s novel and draining it of all the passion, sensuality, and ambience that have seduced readers and moviegoers since the turn of the 20th century."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,30,"Another addition to Universal’s Pictures Classic Monsters arsenal of crap (remember Van Helsing?), director Shore, in his feature debut, displays a fine sense of pacing but little else."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,30,"Much like the recent, widely reviled I, Frankenstein, this misconceived project mainly signals a need to go back to the drawing board."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,30,"Dracula Untold opts for the stately, staid approach, and even at a mere 85 minutes (sans credits) it’s something of a bore — neither scary nor romantic nor exciting in any of the ways it seems to intend."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,25,"If this Dracula can kill hundreds of enemies by himself — and he can, and does, in several dull and protracted battle scenes — then where's the suspense? If he's become a monster for noble reasons, then where's the dark conflict?"
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,25,"It's a story arc that wouldn't be out of place on Game of Thrones, except it lacks for the HBO program's dense and surprising dramatic reflexes."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,20,"Drab, silly and mind-numbing, this Dracula is strictly for the suckers."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,63,"Perhaps surprisingly, it's no better or worse that the other superhero movies of 2015."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,50,"At first, it’s fun and shiny, then you’re left with a crumpled mess on the floor."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,50,"It's overstating things to say the stars of Fantastic Four are Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, and Jamie Bell, because I can't remember the last time four actors appeared less invested in a movie for which they've teamed up."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,50,"Apparently Fantastic Four doesn’t want to be another dumb superhero action flick, but try as they might to turn it into a movingly realistic drama, director Josh Trank and a pair of screenwriters never succeed, creating instead a comic book movie that is bizarrely short on humour and action."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,50,"In short, this Josh Trank-directed reboot had a very low hurdle to overcome to become the best FF movie so far. The most fantastical aspect of the movie is that it may not achieve that goal."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,50,"If Fantastic Four is pleasantly different in its introductory segment, once those super powers kick in, the whole film goes into a more standard gear."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,50,"Is it a home run? No. But at this point, comic fans are just happy to see Fox play error-free ball with their Marvel adaptations, and Fantastic Four mostly qualifies."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,50,"Neither the disaster the fanboy nation seems to be itching to attack nor a significant improvement over the Tim Story movies, Fantastic Four seems doomed to please no one."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,50,"Ultimately, Fox’s stab at reviving one of its inherited Marvel properties feels less like a blockbuster for this age of comics-oriented tentpoles than it does another also-ran — not an embarrassment, but an experiment that didn’t gel."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,49,"Director Josh Trank, whose debut feature “Chronicle” put a smart new spin on superhero tropes, has assembled a quartet of engaging, charismatic performers and stranded them in a miasma of exposition and set-up that sinks the movie."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,42,"It’s shockingly humorless and glacially slow for a film featuring a bendy boy genius, an invisible woman, a human torch, and a talking pile of stones."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,40,"With a weak structure and little chemistry, Fantastic Four proves itself to be a franchise that was better off lost in space."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,40,"The impressive young cast -- is mostly wasted. Teller and company, despite their proven talents, are given little of depth to do and forced to spout dialog that ranges from clunky to ridiculous."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,40,"The model here isn't adventure pulp. It's dystopian Y.A., junked up with scenes of medical horror too scary for kids and too unpleasant to be enjoyed by anyone."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,40,"The film is almost all build-up, though any mounting sense of excitement is dispelled by the monotonously downbeat tone and the cast’s conspicuous lack of chemistry. Nobody looks like they’re having fun, and the gloom is infectious."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,40,"As an origin story that’s all origins and no story, there’s a hollow, stale feeling to this occasionally admirable attempt to Nolanise Marvel’s dysfunctional family."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,40,"Ponderous, pretentious and, most damning of all, just not much fun."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,40,"The cast are some of the most promising actors of their generation, but what chemistry there is between them is swept away by wave after wave of expository dialogue and ludicrous exclamation."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,40,"This reboot of the Marvel superhero franchise is a film of two halves: the first likeable and fun, the second tiresome and loud."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,38,A lightweight and basically unnecessary attempt to once again bring some cinematic life to one of the lesser teams in the Marvel Universe.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,38,"There are no people to watch in Fantastic Four, only collections of character traits and attitudes brought fitfully to life by actors who might've mistakenly thought they were hitching a ride on the superhero movie gravy train by signing up for this misfire."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,33,A superhero film with no power and worse special effects that attempts to rewrite a story that's yet to be told effectively.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,30,"This Fantastic Four, directed by Josh Trank from a script he wrote with Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, feels less like a tale of superhero beginnings than like a very long precredit opening sequence."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,30,A good cast led by Miles Teller gets swallowed up in a narrative that grows progressively more muddled and tedious.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,"Ultimately, what Fantastic Four delivers is change for change’s sake, rather than change for the better."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,Fantastic Four is so mediocre that its title seems like a violation of truth in advertising laws.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,This is the Fantastic Four. Maybe someday they'll get to act like it.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,"The special effects look cheap, the acting is wooden, and the shouted dialogue consists largely of throwaway action-movie cliches (“Let’s do this”) and B-movie sci-fi jargon (“His bioenergy is off the charts!”)."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,An unfortunate movie that does an embarrassing disservice to the decades-old property and is a frightful waste of all the talent involved.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,"From Miles Teller to Kate Mara to Reg E. Cathey, everyone on screen in Fantastic Four speaks in a flat, earnest monotone with a determinedly low-keyed air bordering on openly not giving a rip."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,"It adds more grist for the mill to the notion that studios don't hit the big red ""reboot"" button in any other state than a panic."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,It’s a joyless relaunch/re-imaging.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,"Fantastic Four is so bereft of all the things we expect from a superhero movie — humor, excitement, adventure, awe — that it plays like a drawn-out pilot episode for an upcoming TV series no one would ever watch again."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,"In turning his back on the familiar tropes of blockbuster comic book movies, Trank doesn't have a clear new identity for Fantastic Four to distinguish itself with, and the result is a movie rich with possibilities, but trapped in the basic structure of a superhero movie, with no idea of how to wholly circumvent traditional expectations."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,20,Someone forgot to put anything fantastic into Fantastic Four.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,20,"A sense of heaviness, gloom and complete disappointment settles in during the second half, as the mundane set-up results in no dramatic or sensory dividends whatsoever."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,11,"Steer clear, Friends of Ol’ Marvel!"
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,0,"Given the level of talent involved both in front of and behind the camera, nobody should feel much joy — no anti-tentpole schadenfreude or blockbuster-busting righteousness — to discover that the latest Fantastic Four film is a catastrophe"
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,0,The latest reboot of the Fantastic Four — the cinematic equivalent of malware — is worse than worthless.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,0,"A lousy script, unfocused direction, incoherent editing, shockingly terrible special effects — and, probably, panicked studio executives — have left its four talented stars muddling through a dull superhero origin story with zero payoff."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,80,"This is not for the Merchant-Ivory crowd, but action fans will feel their pulses quicken."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,75,"The gravity-defying harness maneuvers popularized in the U.S. with ""The Matrix"" -- ... look really cool, but seem out of place in a realistic gang-style action movie."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,70,"Doesn't even come close to being a good movie, but it is a lot of fun."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,70,"May not have the best script in the world, but it brings Jet Li to the big screen in a way that all action junkies, not just the video-store geeks, will appreciate."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,70,"A canny, ingeniously crafted guilty pleasure."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,70,"Doesn't take advantage of its own possibilities, either as a hard-boiled gangland battle or as a soft-boiled, interracial Shakespearean love story."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,70,"A plodding, play-it-safe rendition of  ""The Family Feud."""
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,70,"The reason to sit through its uninspired, formulaic moves, however, is its half-dozen spectacular fight sequences."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,67,Doesn't touch (Li's Hong Kong movies). But it is trying something clever.
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,63,"The hinted romance, featuring Aaliyah, makes for some decent drama and some fine comedy."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,63,"In fact, when not kicking butt, (Li)'s kind of a blank spot in the center of the screen."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,60,"Based on ""Romeo and Juliet"" the way a martini is ""based"" on vermouth."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,60,Aspires to rise above the conventional drugs-and-action genre and succeeds about half the time.
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,58,"Just don't think about what's going on, and you should be OK."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,50,Li is a phenomenon.
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,50,"Sadly, if this movie was a fight, they'd have stopped it."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,50,Li's light touch and explosive fighting skills deserve a better vehicle than this overcooked pot of New Jack suey.
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,50,"To be fair, the film is trash and doesn't aspire to very much, but it's bad trash -- inept -- and that really isn't forgivable."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,50,"The fight scenes are splendidly choreographed...but they're shot in that grating, thoroughly American flashcut style that leaves you wondering just who the hell is hitting who."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,49,"Then there's the utter lack of sexual chemistry between Li and Aaliyah, sucking all the urgency out of the relationship between the star-crossed lovers."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,42,(Li)'s scenes are so clearly computer-aided that his moves are about as impressive as Bugs Bunny doing the same.
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,40,"Between fights, the film can't even rely on the luxury of Lindo, Isaiah Washington, Russell Wong, Rottweiler rapper DMX or the scary Henry O as Han's father to make it watchable - the dialogue is wreaking more havoc than Li."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,40,"The wall-to-wall rap score is as kinetic as the acrobatic fight choreography, and nothing else matters."
Romeo Must Die,6.1,55973336,38,"So needlessly convoluted, so crammed with subplots within subplots, it simply forgets about its gangland ""Romeo & Juliet"" premise."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,75,"Wirkola tears through Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters with such giddy abandon, it ends up being splattery fanboy fun. Preposterous, clearly, but fun."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,58,"Unfortunately, Norwegian director Tommy Wirkola’s Hansel & Gretel is just another entry in Bland Fairy Tale Theater, a shapeless riff on those hapless German siblings with the worst parents ever."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,50,"The blend of fairy-tale sentiment and knowing irony worked exactly once, in ""The Princess Bride,"" and fails here. But there's enough visual ingenuity - eye candy, if you will - to make this Hansel & Gretel an intermittently tasty temptation."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,42,"The grim heroes don't have a nuance or more than a hint of emotion between them, and the same goes for the film around them."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,42,"An intermittently fun, but overexcited and predictable mish-mash."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,40,"Though it gives good splat and the scenery’s to die for, Hansel & Gretel gets just about everything wrong. Hammy, boring, chronically unfunny - there’ll be nightmares before bedtime."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,40,"Even if he's slumming, Renner gets it best: his dry delivery fully acknowledges the movie's ridiculousness. If you're planning on entering this fractured fairy tale, you'll want to follow his lead."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,40,The film is smart enough not to wear out its welcome. But that's the only sign of true intelligence in this juvenile caper.
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,40,"While the film rarely provokes any strenuous eye-rolling, it also can't drum up even the slightest interest in the fate of its characters, let alone suspense."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,38,Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is more Gatling guns and grenades than The Brothers Grimm.
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,37,A rarely funny spoof that's heavy on bone-crushing and blood-gushing.
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,30,"There isn't much swashbuckling chemistry between Mr. Renner and Ms. Arterton, and the script doesn't give them enough of the witty lines that can elevate these types of movies to must-see status."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,30,"If the similarly situated ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" took itself too seriously, the problem with Hansel & Gretel is that it doesn't quite take itself seriously enough - which sounds insane, but it's not too much to ask that the movie go beyond its one and only joke. Instead, amid all the fake Sturm und Drang, all we hear is the movie giggling to itself."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,25,"In an age of zombies, werewolves and oversexed vampires, teens won't be shaking in their Uggs over ugly women with bad teeth flying around on brooms, and with its graphic depictions of tortures, mutilations, gang rapes and myriad examples of child abuse, it's no longer a fairy tale suitable for children."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,25,"The film can't be accused of taking itself seriously. Shot in 3-D, with lots of choppy action, a rudimentary plot, and plenty of CGI-shape-shifting, it comes in at a brisk, disposable 88 minutes."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,25,"Not only is not even a single character more than one-dimensional, but every line falls flatter than a witch dispatched with a Gatling gun."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,25,"This genre stew throws in so many ingredients - including sundry body parts that are cut off and go flying, and heads that explode - that the result is a tasteless mash-up that's hard to stomach."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,20,"This movie is a case in point. It's a film which is so demeaningly bad, so utterly without merit, that there is a kind of purity in its awfulness. There is a Zen mastery in producing a film which nullifies the concept of pleasure."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,20,"No stranger to one-joke premises, writer-director Tommy Wirkola (of 2009's Nazi-zombie ""classic"" ""Dead Snow"") populates this frenzied horror-satire with tons of incoherently staged bloodletting and f-bomb–accentuated kiss-off lines. It's a grim fairy tale, all right."

Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,83,Director Zack Snyder (300) has crafted the rare 3-D eyegasm that's worth the premium ticket price.
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,75,"The film is surprisingly deft and entertains at both the adult and juvenile levels. If something in Guardians catches your eye, trust your gizzard."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,75,"A splendid adventure sure to thrill children and fantasy buffs, while leaving everyone else passably entertained."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,70,"This picture sometimes rivals ""Avatar"" in its spectacular landscapes and thrilling flying sequences, but of course it won't come anywhere near those megagrosses, and it's too scary to be wholeheartedly embraced by children."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,70,"There's a confusion that you can sense as well, with the film pulled between its light and dark sides just as the owls struggle with forces of good and evil. That hesitation keeps ""Guardians"" from reaching the deep, emotionally rich center that confers greatness in the animation world."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,63,The result is sometimes charming and always visually astonishing.
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,63,"A gorgeously animated combat fantasy - ""The Lord of the Rings"" meets ""Happy Feet."""
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,63,"The movie is beautiful but, for one unfamiliar with the source material, confusing. I needed an owl scorecard."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,60,"Issues of faith, courage, loyalty, sacrifice and betrayal (the last perpetrated by Soren's brother) are all tackled by Snyder with understated maturity, though a series of slightly repetitive aerial skirmishes can't quite match the inventiveness of Feet's buoyant song-and-dance mash-ups."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,60,"Directorially, the film takes a few too many trips into prosaic slow motion."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,60,"The script is merely serviceable and too reminiscent of similar fantasy tales. But kids will instantly relate to the gentle Soren, while watching wide-eyed as he faces each challenge."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,60,"This is unlikely to win Kathryn Lansky's antipodean owl fantasy any new fans, but even the bemused (and confused) can luxuriate in some grand-scale visual storytelling."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,58,"Unfortunately, the story rarely rises above cookie-cutter kids'-fantasy tropes."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,50,"Legend of the Guardians may be a hoot, but for all its pyrotechnics, it fails to soar."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,50,"Legend of the Guardians sounds as if it were scripted by a team of 11-year-old boys, with too much plot for its 91-minute running time, a script that steals liberally from ""Star Wars"" and some occasionally eye-roll-worthy weirdness."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,50,"Though visually stunning and blessed with immaculate 3D work, film is fatally bogged down by tackling an essentially ridiculous premise (gladiator-attired owls fight genocide) with stony solemnity, and by subsisting on a note of sustained menace and terror in what is ostensibly a children's film."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,40,"The sketchy visual traits that differentiate the many characters in this avian universe will leave viewers crying, ""Who, who"" along with the owls."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,40,Zack Snyder's films have some of the best opening-credits sequences in cinema; the unfortunate thing is that there's always a movie after them.
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,38,"And the action? It's especially hard to determine who's fighting whom in ""Legends,"" because, well, because they are a bunch of owls."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,38,"The movie is still a mess, stumbling from comic-relief scenes that aren't funny to a job-training interlude in which we learn that, among other things, owls make excellent . . . blacksmiths?"
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7,55675313,38,"An unmemorable, frenzied, characterless hodgepodge that delights the eyes while numbing the brain."
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,100,"Never Say Never Again illustrates how much sheer entertainment value can accrue when seasoned, disciplined filmmakers are encouraged to use their accumulated experience and design a classy piece of escapism to the best of their abilities."
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,88,"What makes Never Say Never Again more fun than most of the Bonds is more complex than that. For one thing, there's more of a human element in the movie, and it comes from Klaus Maria Brandauer, as Largo. Brandauer is a wonderful actor, and he chooses not to play the villain as a cliché. Instead, he brings a certain poignancy and charm to Largo, and since Connery always has been a particularly human James Bond, the emotional stakes are more convincing this time."
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,80,What clicks best in the film is the casting. Klaus Maria Brandauer makes one of the best Bond opponents since very early in the series.
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,80,"As directed by Irvin Kershner, Never Say Never Again has noticeably more humor and character than the Bond films usually provide. It has a marvelous villain in Largo."
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,80,"The action's good, the photography excellent, the sets decent; but the real clincher is the fact that Bond is once more played by a man with the right stuff. Civilisation is safe in the hands of he who has never tasted quiche, and who, on the evidence here, at least, can perform a very passable tango."
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,75,"Sean Connery is still up to par as James Bond in the latest adventure of Agent 007,"
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,70,It is good to see Connery's grave stylishness in this role again. It makes Bond's cynicism and opportunism seem the product of genuine worldliness (and world weariness) as opposed to Roger Moore's mere twirpishness.
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,70,Connery was perhaps wise to call it quits the first time round.
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,63,"A persistent disappointment... a flabby, cutesy Bond picture, which derives most of its enduring entertainment value from its cast—starting with the man at the top."
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,60,"Unfortunately, Never Say Never Again is a poor excuse for the veteran actor's return. The humor is over-the-top, the direction is pedestrian, and the storyline drags. Were it not for the simple pleasure of seeing Connery playing 007 one more time, this film would have been nearly unwatchable. All things considered, it's not a very good movie, but at least Connery's charisma salvages parts of it. Unfortunately, Never Say Never Again is a poor excuse for the veteran actor's return.

Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,58,"Connery delivers his usual charming performance, and Brandauer (MEPHISTO, OUT OF AFRICA) makes a great Bond villain. Gone is the excessive gadgetry that mars Bond films, and, as a result, the characters are more prominent and colorful."
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,50,Never Say Never Again never reaches the escapist thrills of vintage Connery and Moore; it cares too much about getting sued than it does about giving the actor a vehicle worth coming back to.
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,50,"It's his sense that he is superior to the series (which he certainly is) that introduces a fatal strain of campiness and condescension. And without absolute conviction, no action film can survive: if there's no belief, there's no danger."
Alien,6.4,55473600,91,"Alien3 is a grimly seductive end-of-the-world thriller, with pop-tragic overtones that build in resonance as the movie goes on."
Alien,6.4,55473600,88,"If Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) had more surprises and James Cameron's Aliens (1986) more thrills, David Fincher's austere, low-tech, darkly funny Alien 3 has more sharply observed characters."
Alien,6.4,55473600,88,"Alien 3 belongs to that branch of fantasy comics, best exemplified by the ""Road Warrior"" movies, in which the iron and space ages meet for dizzy results."
Alien,6.4,55473600,80,"Ironically, Alien is not a bad movie. In fact -- here's the rub -- it's too interesting to make an exciting summer flick."
Alien,6.4,55473600,75,"Fincher's camerawork gives the movie a jittery feel, and his video-trained eye lends the prison sets the look of a dilapidated cathedral, but again, there's really nothing here that we haven't seen before, and better, at that. Nice title, though."
Alien,6.4,55473600,75,A muddled effort that offers little more than visual splendor to recommend it.
Alien,6.4,55473600,75,"Although Alien 3 is stylish--and ambitious--the movie doesn't have the soul or guts to sustain that ambition. It gets swallowed up in its own technology and genre expectations. And Fincher gets stalled in the drama, trapped in too many scenes of talking heads looming out of the gloom."
Alien,6.4,55473600,67,"Alien 3 is, simply put, a mess. The writers have no idea how to tell a coherent, entertaining story. With the exception of a surprise or two, there isn't much worthwhile here."

I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,50,"A flashy, lunkheaded sci-fi extravaganza sure to appeal to teenagers who like their interplanetary warfare bloodless, their high-school soaps squeaky-clean and their numbers countable on one hand."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,50,"The movie is a mixed bag, with many of the elements fun and intriguing, but since this is also a Michael Bay-produced movie, CG monsters and cartoon bad guys gum up a third act."

I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,38,"The cheap, indifferent, teen-alien thriller I Am Number Four delivers none of the spectacle of a competent sci-fi film, none of the emotion of an effective teen romance and none of the giggles of a kitsch fiasco."

I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,20,"I Am Number Four, with its gangly title, seems like a dimwitted cousin to those hipper properties - a Superman-come-lately tale of puppy love, extraordinary powers and puberty that's duller than a chalkboard and less powerful than an extraneous Jonas brother."

The Guardian,6.9,55011732,83,The Guardian is that rarest of cinematic commodities: an action movie displaying brains and heart and the opportunity for its stars to do something more than keep the narrative flowing between explosions.
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,75,"The film's grueling training sequences have a perverse fascination, and, though he's nothing special here, Kutcher is probably the most appealing he has been in a big-screen role."
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,75,"The Guardian doesn't offer too many surprises. Except for one: it's genuinely well-made and, at least when it comes to the character Ben Randall, kind of moving."
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,70,The overlong but involving drama has obvious cross-generational appeal.
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,67,"A surprisingly engaging character-driven picture: not quite Ingmar Bergman, of course, but not Michael Bay either."
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,63,"Sometimes you want to buy an extra-large popcorn and settle in for a big budget Hollywood blockbuster replete with entertaining explosions, undemanding dialogue and completely unrealistic action sequences. If all that sounds like gloriously uncomplicated fun, The Guardian is your movie."
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,63,Ultimately a valentine to the unsung heroes of the US Coast Guard and it's probably long overdue.
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,63,"It's not easy being macho while you're shivering like a frozen puppy, but Kutcher pulls it off."
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,63,"At its best when its heroes race furiously toward their missions, most of which involve jumping out of a helicopter into surging waves."
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,63,"With high seas and crashing waves created by Canadian special-effects company Fusion CIS, there's nothing wrong with the nail-biting side of the equation featuring a sequence of distinct maritime accidents; it's the rest of the plot that is taking on water."
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,60,"An action movie, a basic training movie, a swaggering sea adventure, a home front melodrama and an inspiring tough-love heroic teacher fable. If the aggregate of all these movies is exhausting and occasionally overwrought, some of the parts are stirring and effective, though not exactly fresh."
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,60,That the film doesn't rise above the formulaic is a particular disappointment as these stunningly brave Rescue Swimmers deserve a film as daring as they are.
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,60,"As a story of courage and personal growth, The Guardian is perfunctory, a saga of character building that could (and may, advertently or otherwise) serve as a Coast Guard recruitment vehicle. But it's far more interesting as a tale of two faces: Kutcher and Costner have a kind of visual chemistry that's just as elusive as the other kind. And the connection and contrast between them remind us that Hollywood isn't as forgiving of older male actors as we like to think."
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,58,The movie represents an earnest effort to compensate for all the love the media has shown to firefighters and other land-based first responders in recent years with little thought to the Coast Guard; the drama also crashes on wave upon wave of clichés.
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,58,"Tries tremendously hard to win audiences over with manly derring-do, exciting action, and impossible-obstacles-overcome uplift. And it's undeniably compelling for minutes at a time"

The Guardian,6.9,55011732,50,There's nothing in The Guardian that audiences haven't previously been exposed to ad nauseam.
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,50,"The only performance worth watching is Costner's. Now that he seems resigned to being something less than an A-list luminary, he is often modest and affecting."
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,50,The overly familiar plot points also make the film feel a little dated.
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,50,"Don't be surprised if, in the middle of The Guardian, you get an overpowering sense of déjà vu. Assuming you've seen ""An Officer and a Gentleman,"" ""Top Gun"" or any of the myriad basic-training films Hollywood churns out, you've seen The Guardian."
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,50,"I'm not suggesting Costner and Kutcher should run out and remake ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" just yet, but in The Guardian, the two actors turn out to complement each other well enough to make a lot of this supremely derivative and formulaic picture go down better than it should."
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,50,"Costner has the stoic routine down pat, and there are some spectacular action sequences of helicopter rescues on the high seas, but Kutcher is in way over his head."
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,50,A predictable amalgam of every military-academy movie you can think of.
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,50,"The point of all this solemnity may be to pay serious respect to those rescue swimmers, who courageously look after errant kayakers or victims of Hurricane Katrina. But what we get in exchange is a movie that feels too much like a Coast Guard recruitment film. Who wants to pay to see that?"
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,50,"When Costner is good, as he is here, his acting has a purity to it, an unspoken moral dimension. Underneath the sensitive, stoic facade is a loquacious, intellectually alert actor with an encyclopedic understanding of the film tradition he occupies: the rugged, humble movie hero, embodied by the likes of Gary Cooper and Henry Fonda."
The Guardian,6.9,55011732,50,"Ultimately, The Guardian veers off into slobbery touchy-feeliness, and the tone becomes mock-religious, almost liturgical."

The Jackal,6.4,54930280,90,"With its strong premise, a couple of fine performances and highly polished tooling, The Jackal scores as an involving high-tech thriller that occasionally hits peaks of pulsating excitement."
The Jackal,6.4,54930280,60,"Plotted densely enough to make the lulls forgivable, this movie concerns a contract killer (Bruce Willis) who employs several small-business owners to craft his super-high-tech weapons and the many accessories that enable him to assume multiple identities."
The Jackal,6.4,54930280,60,"It's a good job this works so well as a machine-made movie, because its grasp of political realities is nebulous."
The Jackal,6.4,54930280,50,"Actually, the more distance the studio places between the two films, the better, because the 1997 production can't hold a candle to the 1973 release, and an attempted comparison only makes the new Bruce Willis/Richard Gere vehicle look worse."
The Jackal,6.4,54930280,50,"The Jackal, like most expensive thrillers nowadays, knows how to do gadgets, pyrotechnics, underground subway chases and panicked crowd scenes. But except for Mr. Gere's uphill battle, it has only the vaguest idea of how to do people."
The Jackal,6.4,54930280,50,"Amusing performances -- especially from Willis, who takes on a new personality with each new hairstyle -- can't disguise the fact that the film is basically a pastiche of recent movies."
The Jackal,6.4,54930280,50,The Jackal isn't much--it certainly isn't up to the 1973 Fred Zinnemann Day of the Jackal it loosely adapts and updates--but it does offer the fascination of watching big-ticket actors attempt to spin their images.
The Jackal,6.4,54930280,50,"A trashy, frenetic remake of Fred Zinnemann's 1973 The Day of the Jackal, The Jackal is mired in blood, cheap shocks, and a random network of improbability."
The Jackal,6.4,54930280,50,"Though consistently handsome, the film never quite achieves the shallow but hugely seductive intensity of its MTV-style opening credits sequence."
The Jackal,6.4,54930280,50,"To enjoy it, however, you have to do the mental equivalent of squinting your eyes, so the credibility is only fuzzily ridiculous."
The Jackal,6.4,54930280,40,"At best, The Jackal is an uninspired, by-the-numbers action thriller."
The Jackal,6.4,54930280,40,The Jackal is based on a fabrication so absurd that it almost made me laugh out loud.
The Jackal,6.4,54930280,38,"The Jackal, on the other hand, impressed me with its absurdity. There was scarcely a second I could take seriously."

The Jackal,6.4,54930280,30,"Sporadically effective, it appears not to have particularly excited the people who made it, and that lackadaisical quality is a drawback."
The Jackal,6.4,54930280,30,"This remake of Fred Zinnemann's well-regarded Day of the Jackal (1973) not only fails to match the modest entertainment value of Frederick Forsyth's workmanlike source novel, but actually moves into late contention for the title of 1997's most tedious movie."
The Jackal,6.4,54930280,30,"Michael Caton-Jones' pompous and coarsely stupid inflation of what remains a superior thriller, Fred Zinnemann's The Day of the Jackal (1973)."
The Jackal,6.4,54930280,25,"What keeps coming to mind throughout The Jackal is that for what it cost to make this movie you could probably pay some nice hit man to eliminate everyone at Universal who thought making the movie would be a good idea, and still have enough left over to throw one of those hit man parties and have a really great time."
The Jackal,6.4,54930280,10,The usually reliable director Michael Caton-Jones hasn't a clue how to freshen up such stale material.

Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,88,"Jingoistic politics are not proper or prudent in the pluralistic human society of the 1990s. It's much easier to assuage these baser urges by facing a real nonhuman enemy that just wants to kill you. War is gore. You or them. That message is the real strength of ""Starship Troopers,"" although many may find it morally flawed. No matter, this is powerful entertainment that appeals to our most basic instincts."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,83,"The movie is sensationally exciting, but its hey-kids-let s-put-on-a-war! story line plays like Beverly Hills, 90210 recast as a military-recruitment film for the Third Reich."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,80,"A spectacularly gung-ho sci-fi epic that delivers two hours of good, nasty fun."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,75,"Although none of the characters are fleshed out much beyond the comic book level, we nevertheless find our sympathies aligning with them."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,75,"The film's special effects are astonishing, but the most notable and unexpected thing is its tone."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,67,"Wall to wall blood 'n' guts laced with surprisingly keen social satire, much of it targeting the fatuousness of media culture."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,60,This is a movie nasty enough to kill off the major characters twice and still manage to serve up a happy ending.
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,60,"Faithfully represents Heinlein's militarism, his Big Brother state, and a value system in which the highest good is to kill a friend before the Bugs can eat him. The underlying ideas are the most interesting aspect of the film."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,50,"Paul Verhoeven's movie takes more action than ideas from Robert A. Heinlein's 1959 novel, which is just as well, considering the book's goofy suggestion that military veterans should control society from top to bottom."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,50,"The word ""arachnid,"" as it's said so contemptuously in the movie, begins to sound suspiciously like ""Iraqi,"" and indeed, we soon see the elite bugs are hunkered down in their desert fortress, resisting the mighty air assaults of the Federation. The conclusion of our story involves unearthing the chief bug."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,50,"What Ed Neumeier's script provides instead is a cheerfully lobotomized, always watchable experience that has the simple-mindedness of a live-action comic book, with no words spoken that wouldn't be right at home in a funny paper dialogue balloon. Not just one comic book either, but an improbable and delirious combination of ""Weird Science,"" ""Betty and Veronica"" and ""Sgt. Rock and His Howling Commandos."""
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,50,"A collection of shots and characters designed to circle the globe rather than to say anything much about either the filmmakers or the audience, a triumph of multinational capital at work rather than of people or ideas."

Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,40,"Pretty actors, grisly critters, brains sucked out of skulls, buckets of green slime and a plot that is half beach blanket bingo, half Iwo Jima."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,40,"Nothing like the sight of thousands of scuttling, hideous, practically indestructible insects crawling up the sides of a fortress, hellbent on destroying the human race. As they keep coming and coming, theyre the only things in this movie earning your money."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,40,An empty videogame of a movie about interplanetary pest control.
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,30,"In this bizarrely discordant mixture of ultraviolent action footage, bad acting, crisp special effects and futuristic camp, the remnants of Heinlein's rhetoric of military pride stick out like a grimy Marine uniform at a high-toned Hollywood party."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,30,"It's exactly like ""Star Wars"" -- if you subtract a good story, sympathetic characters, intelligence, wit and moral purpose."

Source Code,7.5,54712227,80,"What's really cool about the film - in addition to Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Stevens - is how Jones makes sure that we don't know any more than Stevens does, right up till the end."

Source Code,7.5,54712227,80,"It's not nearly as complex and eerily existential as the director's debut, ""Moon,"" but in its own way it's an even more satisfying time slice of identity-scrambled sci-fi."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,78,The psychological payoffs outweigh any implausibilities. And what's the harm in logging off your network for a few hours to indulge in some good old-fashioned science fiction?
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,"In Source Code, the new thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal, ""Groundhog Day"" goes metaphysical. Some people, I know, will argue that ""Groundhog Day"" was already metaphysical. Perhaps, but compared with ""Source Code,"" it's ""Caddyshack."""

Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,"Working from a tight script by Ben Ripley, Jones creates scary, hairy, high-octane tension. Disbelief? Suspended, until the logic lapses kick in later. It's a small price to pay for a ride that starts at wild and accelerates from there."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,"For a while it's the rare film that-in the mold of the first ""Matrix"" movie and ""Inception,"" although on a more modest scale than either-mixes heady puzzles with gripping suspense."

Source Code,7.5,54712227,70,"In crucial ways, Source Code, written by Ben Ripley, recalls ""Moon,"" Mr. Jones's accomplished feature debut about a solitary astronaut played by Sam Rockwell. Source Code is bigger, shinier, pricier."

Source Code,7.5,54712227,63,"Based on its thrillingly fractured first half - not to mention ""Moon"" in its entirety - Jones seems much smarter than he allows the film to be in the end. It wriggles out of its own intriguing puzzle."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,60,"What begins as a tense, inventive suspense film becomes, to paraphrase Doctor Who, a wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey, mushy-wushy mess. That's decidedly NOT fantastic."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,60,"The movie boils down to one character, acting under enormous pressures of space and time, racing to solve a mystery. In this case, that may be good enough."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,60,"It is a tremendous downer when the second half of the movie shirks logic, defies its own established principles and raises more questions than it answers."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,50,"Gyllenhaal is particularly unsuited to this role, his saucer eyes flashing from calm to crazed."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,50,"Solid execution and some provocative ideas can't save Source Code from a fatal hubris, as it thinks itself far more clever than it actually is and assumes it's earned emotions at which it's only hinted."

Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,68,"Assassin’s Creed’s creators have the courage to always take themselves seriously, even when they’re working with material that sounds fundamentally silly. There’s no great leap of faith in Assassin’s Creed, but a surprising amount of the time, it at least finds steady footing."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,67,"Declaring Assassin’s Creed to be the best video game movie ever made is the kind of backhanded compliment that sounds like hyperbole, but the description fits the bill on both counts. Regardless of what you call this peculiar, arrestingly uninviting nonsense, the fact of the matter is that it’s the only blockbuster of 2016 that left me desperate for a sequel."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,63,"By showing signs of intelligent life in a universe of diseased, digital drivel, Assassin's Creed stands above the herd of movies based on video games by default."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,63,"It also has great momentum, good set pieces, and so much frothy nihilism it’s just plain fun."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,60,"Assassin's Creed will be polarizing, but it's fascinating as an entry in Kurzel's oeuvre. It is singularly his film — both in style and the obsession with hubris, power and violence."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,60,"The frenetic action is Assassin’s Creed’s saving grace. Inventively choreographed and beautifully executed, its game-inspired brand of wushu-meets-parkour delivers some genuinely awe-inducing feats."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,60,"Assassin’s Creed makes you actively work for its pleasures, and it’s heartening to see a film of this scale that’s strange and ambitious and doesn’t spoon-feed viewers every little detail."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,60,"The relentless gloom can feel oppressive, but there’s plenty of ambition here, especially in the layered storytelling and woozy sense of time and place, with plenty of soaring aerial shots that nod quietly to the all-seeing eye of a computer game."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,60,"Valiant, but flawed. Some of the set-pieces are superb, but there isn’t enough meat on the bones to turn this into a classic."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,"Obtuse, narratively incoherent, and ultimately frustrating, it stands as another example of how hard it is to make a good mainstream movie out of a popular computer game."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,"The effect is less video-game-turned-movie than zombie movie minus zombies: stilted, static, s-l-o-o-o-w. The ending couldn’t set up a sequel more clearly if “To be continued” appeared on a title card. Don’t count on it. Game on? Game over."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,The picture has an undeniable rough stylishness...but in terms of coherence of storytelling it leaves the audience choking on all that swirling dust.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,"What saves this head-scratching, relentlessly portentous movie is what also saves the games: the action is on point."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,It’s incrementally more fun than it is silly.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,"Assassin’s Creed is nearly wall-to-wall violence, but Kurzel reveals an eye for widescreen composition that, paired with Christopher Tellefsen’s efficient, hyperactive editing, gives the film the tenor of a sophisticated graphic novel."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,Assassin’s Creed bears a jumbled narrative and self-serious approach that ends up feeling far too assaultive on the senses without any genuine pay-off.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,42,"The movie is at least interestingly confusing until about the halfway mark, when monotony sets in for good."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,42,It’s all window-dressing for an ending that reveals this alternately goofy and self-serious big-budget Hollywood product to be little more than a two-hour prelude to a potential future franchise.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,40,"Assassin’s Creed is leaps and bounds ahead of kitchen-sink-hurling flapdoodle like X-Men Apocalypse – it’s only the second-worst Fassbender star vehicle of 2016 – but it never allows him a sober moment, as that film did in a hushed Polish forest, where his talent, as opposed to his biceps, gets a stern workout."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,40,"In Assassin’s Creed, Michael Fassbender is like the ultimate special effect. Just by showing up, he confers respectability on two hours of semi-coherent overly art-directed video-game sludge."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,38,Never before have such acting heavyweights been so misused on screen.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,38,"Unlike the actual video game, Assassin's Creed isn't ridiculous and fun, but rather ridiculous and turgid."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,38,"Quest or no quest, cool locations or green screen soundstages, shirtless Fassbender or Fassbender in an assassin’s hoodie, “Assassin’s” never breaks the creed of Hollywood filmed video games — “Action packed, but dull.”"
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,Any fans hoping that Assassin's Creed would break the long streak of poor video game adaptations are bound to be disappointed by this nearly incomprehensible mess.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,"Another entry in a long line of good video games adapted into terrible movies, Assassin’s Creed is ragingly stupid. That its incoherent plotline is treated with the utmost reverence by skilled thespians only brings its idiocy into sharper relief."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,"For an ostensible action movie, the cast spends an awful lot of time standing around and looking lost. I can only guess that they were following their director’s lead."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,"The acting offers little relief. Fassbender gives a super serious performance in a movie that needed his natural sense of humor. Playing his Abstergo doctor, Cotillard's accent is so bizarre and disconcerting, it's impossible to believe she’s the same actress who’s been so amazing in everything else she's done. As for Jeremy Irons, who plays her scientist father, it's hard to imagine this is anything more than a payday."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,"Assassin’s Creed is resolutely stone-faced, ditching the humdrum quips that are par for the course in today's blockbusters. But this is almost two hours of convoluted hokum that might have benefited from a few self-deflating jabs."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,The Assassin's Creed movie is about all the parts you might skip in the games.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,The plot is that most dreadful of mixes: both laughably silly and needlessly complicated.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,Assassin’s Creed the movie is fairly innocuous. It’s also cheerless and dumb.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,25,"Here’s a film that turns Michael Fassbender into a puppet, and oh, those strings hold him down."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,25,"It's just a mediocre action movie, poorly edited and larded with a terrible musical score, based on a video game. Nothing new there."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,25,"As might be obvious, I’m not a gamer, so perhaps all of this will be thrilling for fans who’ve played it. The rest of us, I imagine, may come out of this film invigorated with a creed of our own: Avoid movies based on video games."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,20,"Assassin’s Creed is a dour, lifeless film that leaves those familiar with the material perplexed, and those ignorant of it downright clueless."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,20,It’s rare to see a film quite so lacking in animus. It exists only to gouge money out of gamers. They might well want to stick to the game.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,12,The film ends up with both blurry action that often looks digitally faked and a fractious plot that’s stuck over-explaining itself.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,10,"I suppose you could say the film made me slightly more likely to play one of the games, but only because I’d do just about anything before I saw this movie again."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,100,"That tale gets a first-class Hallmark Hall of Fame treatment in Kevin Reynolds's swaggering The Count of Monte Cristo, which is old-form moviemaking at its best."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,90,"It's a heady mix of the earnest, the grave, and the frivolous. Wizardly director Kevin Reynolds even manages to condense into a single shot, with a wisp of humor, several of the hero’s long years in a dungeon without making them any less grueling."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,80,"Reynolds, working in close harmony with cinematographer Andrew Dunn (Gosford Park), brings an infectious brio and an occasional sweeping grace to the classic trappings of Dumas."

The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,75,"Sail to the box office, swashbucklers. Dumas is back in style."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,75,"The week's guilty pleasure is The Count of Monte Cristo, a gorgeously photographed, sumptuously designed adaptation of the Dumas swashbuckler boasting the most ludicrous dialogue since director Kevin Reynolds's ""Waterworld."""
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,75,"The new Count moves with the smooth, plastic efficiency of a TV miniseries. Inspiration and originality may be in short supply, but the movie gets the job done."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,75,"The film tells an engaging swashbuckler on its own terms, and that's what director Kevin Reynolds has done with this old-fashioned romp of revenge."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,75,"While fleeting moments from Pearce and Luis Guzmán (as Caviezel's loyal servant) suggest the film might have been even more fun had they been allowed to loosen up a bit, the finished product still offers little cause for complaint."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,70,"As a revenge thriller, the movie is serviceable, but it doesn't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,70,"The best thing in The Count of Monte Cristo is Guy Pearce's snot-nosed hauteur. He gives this scoundrel some wounded edges, and frills as well."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,70,"For younger audiences drawn by the attractive actors, this might be their introduction to the Dumas epic. At least it's an effective and rousing version."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,70,"The story stands up pretty well for a movie that's about 20 minutes longer than it ought to be, and has few of the action-beats that action-film audiences have grown accustomed to."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,67,"Wolpert and Reynolds seem to be aiming for the ''Titantic'' audience at the expense of sophistication and historical relevance. It's too bad. The able cast, not to mention Alexandre Dumas, deserves better."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,67,A mediocre production that nevertheless will strike a deep and resonant chord with viewers.
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,63,"This is solid entertainment, and the time Caviezel and Pearce spent training for their sword fights pays off handsomely."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,63,"The film's resolute indifference to fashion makes it, perhaps paradoxically, a refreshing piece of old-style entertainment, accompanied by a whooshing, trembling score by Edward Shearmur."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,63,"This latest version, made with the MTV generation in mind, is arguably the least impressive of the filmed Counts."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,60,This seems to be a movie made by people who love the old classic movie swashbucklers but don't have a clue how to make or modernize them.
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,60,"In the end, it's a film so short on style and verve it feels lifeless; audiences might feel imprisoned in the Château d'If, praying for escape or quick death. Thankfully, one need not tunnel out of a movie theater."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,60,"Revenge may be sweet, but this is one ""Monte Cristo"" that leaves a sour taste."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,50,"More fun than Peter Hyams' ""The Musketeer,"" and somewhat less so than ""The Man in the Iron Mask,"" this is middling Dumas all the way."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,50,To say the film doesn't quite recapture the thrill of the novel is like saying that soda pop doesn't really have the same kick as heroin.
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,50,"This is the time of the year movie studios traditionally dump their mistakes into theaters -- and boy, did Disney make a whopper with The Count of Monte Cristo."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,63,"At its best, TMNT does recall the slangy fun of the series' glory days. But there are too many moments when it feels as stale as one of Mikey's half-eaten pizzas."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,63,"TMNT has a cool, noirish sheen. There's an attention to detail in the visuals and sound design that pushes it up several notches above most kiddie fare. It's not art, dude, but it will do."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,58,This all-CG reboot is missing the goofy excitement of the old TMNT.
TMNT,6.3,54149098,58,"The story -- something to do with an ancient evil returning after 3,000 years -- plays like a multi-episode story arc of the TV series."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,58,Only those already predisposed to love a TMNT movie that at least LOOKS edgy are likely to care.
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,"A tad too conservative and calculated. CGI delivers best on moody sets and a noirish atmosphere achieved by lighting, backgrounds and visual effects. But the characters look like plastic dolls, and the story is recycled sci-fi."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,"Munroe's script denies fans the satisfaction of a decent story or amusing interactions. Rather than waiting for a screenplay that warranted their bigscreen return, TMNT feels like an attempt to exploit the phenomenon further."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,"Writer-director Kevin Munroe parties like it's 1989, grooving on the extreme-sports set pieces and vintage slang to generally cowabusted effect."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,The upshot is that the film is technically superb and quite enjoyable as long as you don't bang your head against the plot.
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,"That's really what TMNT lacks most -- humor. Despite the doll-like cartoonishness of the human figures, the filmmakers seem to expect us to take this animated romp seriously. Too seriously."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,"Silly, but an enjoyable, well-paced fantasy-action story."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,"Fans should be satisfied, but it's hard to imagine anyone else will be much interested in TMNT."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,"The movie is a serviceable way to pass the time: Kids will cheer the bright colors and funny new words (""Kowabunga!"")."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,"With your sharper minds, you'll probably figure it out. I hope so. Hope you'll like the movie too. But here's a bit of advice: Don't bet your allowance on it. Make Daddy pay."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,40,"The turtles themselves may look prettier, but are no smarter; torn irreparably from their countercultural roots, our superheroes on the half shell have been firmly co-opted by the industry their creators once sought to spoof."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,40,"I expected to see the triumphant return of my childhood favorites, yet I feel like this wasn't the answer."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,38,It takes more than an awkward title attempting to sound cool to overcome its mundane plot and silly dialogue.
TMNT,6.3,54149098,38,"Bummer, dudes. Longtime fans who expect the fun lingo and pizza-gobbling Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles of the past may be shocked by director Kevin Munroe's reimagining of the popular kiddie series."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,38,"The movie pretty much exists to sell tie-in products, and it's about as entertaining as watching little kids playing with their toys in the sandbox."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,25,"Without the brute vigilante junk, this 82-minute picture would be approximately 2 minutes long."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,20,It's all probably too slippery for the youngest viewers to grasp and too sketchy for the nostalgia crowd (for whom this revival seems most geared).
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,80,"John Woo's smart thriller Paycheck may not intend to be political, but it's marked as much by its era as post-Watergate thrillers like ""The Parallax View"" or ""Three Days Of The Condor."""
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,70,A nifty science-fiction twist on the old amnesia plot where a guy spends most of a movie trying to remember what he did and why everyone is after him.
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,70,"Quite honestly, if this had been a more violent film, it wouldnt have been nearly as much fun."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,67,"Affleck is in the middle, engaging in derring-do, pitching woo to Uma Thurman and making the whole thing come off as less exciting than it should have been."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,63,Slick and slight.
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,63,"There are chases that feel way too long, and dialogue that feels flat. Affleck and Thurman make a handsome duo, but there's no spark between the actors."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,63,"We're left with the painful reality that Paycheck might get Alfred Hitchcock, but it certainly doesn't know Philip K. Dick."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,60,"Woo's film is in some ways closer to Dick's -- and his own -- pulp roots, and if he lazily quotes himself (and, inexplicably, Aldrich's ""Kiss Me Deadly"") once too often, he at least gets loose, spirited performances from his cast -- Uma's post-""Kill Bill"" gravitas notwithstanding."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,60,"in the end, Paycheck never quite cashes out."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,58,"The amazing thing about John Woo's steely, impersonal adaptation of Philip K. Dick sci-fi story about a tech genius whose memory is erased...is how it vanishes in front of our eyes even as we watch it."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,50,"Unfortunately, after watching Paycheck, you may wish you had the picture's gimmickry at your disposal, so you could erase your own memory of it."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,50,"Woo has never been particularly good at human stuff, and to the extent that Paycheck is, or should be, a love story, it feels forced."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,50,"Maybe Affleck was drawn to this movie because it involves the loss of memory. Who wouldn't want to forget ""Gigli,"" and now this?"
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,50,"The silliness only slows down for a few hokey romantic interludes. But if you like to see stuff crash or blow up, this is your movie."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,50,"Begins with a thought-provoking idea from Philip K. Dick, exploits it for its action and plot potential, but never really develops it."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,50,Surprisingly . . . ept given that it is basically a dumb movie about smart people. This smooth but bland thriller may be the best we could expect from such a collaboration.
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,50,"Paycheck is too smart for a mindless actioneer, and too slick to capture the full moral weight of Dick's dystopia."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,50,"Running mainly on adrenaline and a gimmick, it's different from other holiday movies in that it's not ambitious, earnest or overblown, and it obviously wasn't made with one eye on the Oscars."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,50,"The bogus Seattle setting creates an additional problem for local moviegoers. Because we know Seattle doesn't have a subway, giant FBI building or newspapers called Telegraph or Tribune, we're jarred out of the story so regularly that it leaves us slightly punch-drunk."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,50,Paycheck is one of those movies in which all the ingenuity went into the original idea and none into its execution.
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,50,A fun if dumb movie.
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,50,"Woo's customary action-film pyrotechnics gather more substance than usual from the implausible but inventive plot, drawn from a Philip K. Dick story."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,50,"Longtime fans of John Woo, who have come to accept operatic, lead-slinging death dances as an integral part of the directors powerful aesthetic, will probably be unsatisfied with this neutered variation on his earlier, superior works."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,40,Uninspired star turns from Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman suggest something less than full belief in this quickly forgettable thriller.
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,40,"The sort of noisy nonsense that Woo's earlier action movies made irrelevant, but alas not extinct."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,40,"Affleck is no more convincing as a flesh-and-blood action than as a superbrain, Thurman is cruelly photographed and director Woo appears to be imitating his own worst work."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,38,"With a script that waffles between being hilariously absurd and insultingly stupid, and action scenes that won't cause anyone's pulse to skip a beat, Paycheck is less appealing than a lump of coal in a Christmas stocking."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,38,"The story, adapted by Dean Georgaris, doesn't come within a light year of science-fiction plausibility, and after a while Woo gives up trying to sell it and reverts to the action choreography that made him a master of Hong Kong martial-arts movies."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,38,"Isn't a bad movie, until John Woo remembers that he's John Woo and we remember that Ben Affleck is Ben Affleck."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,38,Paycheck is a bogus journey.
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,30,"Paycheck is a terribly muddled mess, a Hitchcock homage (with generous, obvious nods to The Birds, Strangers on a Train and North by Northwest) by a great filmmaker trying to say a great deal with so very little."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,25,"The title of this limp retread of ""Minority Report"" -- both films are based on stories by Philip K. Dick -- presumably refers to the reason the big names involved did this movie."
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,20,Represents such a professional nadir for each of its principals that you wish better for them in the new year.
Paycheck,6.3,53790451,20,Maybe its time for Woo to finally make that musical he keeps talking about.
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,75,"The battle scenes in Rambo III are explosive, conflagratory tableaux that make for wrenching, frequently terrifying viewing. Always at ground zero in the chaos is Rambo - gloriously, inhumanly impervious to fear and danger - whose character is inhabited by Stallone with messianic intensity."
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,70,"Rambo's self-important, weight-of-the-world manner and his taste for political posturing would make him genuinely silly were they not counterbalanced by Mr. Stallone's startling, energetic physical presence and the film's stabs at self-mocking humor."
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,70,Strays slightly from the formula and therefore loses some of its mindless fun credentials.
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,63,"Though less offensive than its predecessor, Rambo III -- which is dedicated to ""the gallant people of Afghanistan"" -- is still a mindless and uninspired effort."
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,50,"Once again, John Rambo guns amok in the name of American democracy, but he packs less dramatic firepower than last time. Rambo III, a poorly paced, much less involving show of guns and machismo, makes you miss ""Rambo II"" (okay, ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"")."
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,40,"As you might expect, the calculations here are on a much less sophisticated level. And by less sophisticated, I mean like counting on fingers."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,100,Hero is the masterpiece. It employs unparalleled visual splendor to show why men must make war to secure the peace and how warriors may find their true destiny as lovers.
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,100,"Swooningly beautiful, furious and thrilling, Zhang Yimou's Hero is an action movie for the ages."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,100,Breathtaking masterpiece.
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,100,"A walloping entertainment, brimming with the magic-realist action that made Ang Lee's somewhat similar ""Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" a hit."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,100,"Led by director Zhang Yimou and dazzling cinematographer Christopher Doyle, the unseen Hero production team has made what just might be the most artistically sophisticated, most formally beautiful martial arts film the genre has seen."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,100,The result is both thrilling and thoughtful.
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,100,"Hero is a movie that lives up to all the nobility of its title, a gift to movie audiences who cherish the opportunity to be transported to a heretofore unimagined world and absorbed totally into what happens there."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,100,One of the most ravishing spectacles the movies have given us.
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,100,Hero is one of the most beautiful and involving films of the year.
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,100,"The comparisons are inevitable, so let's get them out of the way. Hero is a better film than ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."""
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,100,"It's a story about storytelling, with differing versions of events in which people die by the sword. Filled with Yimou's characteristic symbolism and zest for striking colors, it's a fictional account of the unification of China."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,91,"Yimou plays his images like a visual symphony, and turns a potential costume pageant into an exhilarating national myth."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,91,Perhaps the most beautiful film to hit Portland movie screens this year.
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,90,"Hero is an epic, evocative of another epoch and of landscapes beyond time. It's overwhelming. And yet I miss the animating anger of Zhang's early masterworks, in which penniless young lovers were oppressed by impotent old men."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,90,"You can feel the movie's sensibility and its powerful emotions in every aching image, which leaves you so caught up in these ancient times, you're loath to return to present-day normalcy."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,90,This is a leap into grandeur.
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,89,A terrific piece of work.
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,88,"If you found ""Crouching Tiger"" a stunning bore, you probably won't fall under Hero's spell. But the rest of us, well, we'll be more than happy to savor every moment of its strange, ravishing beauty."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,88,"Its stars - especially the photogenic Leung and Cheung, fresh from Wong Kar Wai's jazzy romance In the Mood for Love - are wonderfully charismatic. And wonderfully athletic."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,88,A visual poem of extraordinary beauty.
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,88,"Hero is elliptical, primal, radically disjointed, and female-empowering. Everything a wu xia should be…and then som"
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,83,I wish 'Hero's emotional heat rose more intensely -- more recklessly. There's something grand but distant and almost fetishistic about the operatic solemnity with which Zhang approaches the Rashomonic story of assassins attempting to kill a king.
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,80,"Hero is not a CTHD clone; its a wonderful movie in its own right, staking its own territory as a dreamlike meditation on motivation and love."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,80,"A dazzlingly lensed, highly stylized meditation on heroism."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,80,"If his (Zhang's) fight scenes don't fully intoxicate, though, his color and compositional rigor compensate for much. See Hero on the biggest screen you can find, and sit close enough for all that spiraling silk to tickle your nostril hairs."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,80,"Here is a film where every frame feels individually designed, with saturated colour and symmetry reflecting the texture and natural wonder of the environment."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,75,"If there's a drawback, it's that the plot is trite. Hero is an exemplary example of visual poetry. The narrative is clearly of secondary concern."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,75,"As gorgeous and contemplative as it is, Hero is a genre picture and needs to deliver the action goods. To that end, there are plenty of clever, lovingly choreographed sequences."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,75,"It's full of passionate performances (except for the wooden Li), sizzling swordplay, bold and dazzling hues, and breathtaking landscapes."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,75,"These people may be really, really dangerous, but they're also really, really polite."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,75,"In the end, the spectacular martial-arts epic seems to signify nothing much more than its own beauty, as brilliant and ephemeral as a fireworks display."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,75,"Not as profound as it is pretty, Hero nevertheless gives us something to ponder beyond Zhang's feat in mounting such a magnificent production."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,75,"The film never musters the intimate feel the gifted director brought to such early films as ""Raise the Red Dragon"" and ""Ju Dou."" You cheer his accomplishment in Hero without ever feeling close to it."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,70,"Brilliant in flashes, thinned out as a whole, the film seems ideal for the DVD revolution, where the greatest hits can be compiled at the touch of a remote."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,70,"Zhang Yimou's impeccably crafted, all-star martial arts extravaganza, is the essence of shallow gravitas."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,70,"Hero keeps its characters stiffly archetypal, like chess pieces sent whizzing through outrageous maneuvers. Unfortunately, this apparent choice of spectacle over intimacy put me at a slight remove."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,70,"Filled with meticulous set pieces, including a showdown between Snow and Moon set among swirls of golden-yellow leaves, Hero is easy on the eyes, but it's too segmented to gather much momentum and too art-directed to convey much urgency."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,70,"Though the specifics of the story may be unfamiliar to Western viewers, its broad outlines and underlying themes are universal, and Christopher Doyle's ravishing cinematography transcends language."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,70,"It's a brilliant movie, fluent, spectacular, breathtaking and basically, uh, wrong."
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,70,"So deliriously chockablock with high-flying, color-coordinated fight scenes that non-aficionados may find it all a bit bewildering--a gorgeous abstraction. It sure is gorgeous, though, and it has a dream cast"
Ying xiong,7.9,53710019,70,A movie just good enough to keep nurturing rooting interest as you watch it.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,100,James Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma restores the wounded heart of the Western and rescues it from the morass of pointless violence.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,100,"The new version is a glorious, thrilling throwback that never sacrifices its solid roots in the western genre despite a sharp modern update that actually improves on the original."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,100,"The finest American Westerns have a characteristic that 3:10 to Yuma shares. In a way that's almost mystical, they suggest a truth beyond the specifics of the tale."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,91,The rousing new Western 3:10 to Yuma has the sweep of an epic and the economy of a stopwatch.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,90,James Mangold directs it with such energy and passion that it's as if he didn't know it's all been done before.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,90,"Mangold has time to build sensational, studied characterizations, brilliant pacing (courtesy Mike McCuster, who also edited the director’s previous effort, the Johnny Cash biopic “Walk the Line”), and blistering action."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,88,"The nerve-racking wait at the Contention hotel is no longer the film's centerpiece, but the deeper characterization gives Bale an opportunity to once again sink his teeth into a complex role, and offers a reminder as to why the notoriously difficult Crowe is sometimes worth the trouble."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,88,"Unlike Glenn Ford, a soft-spoken studio star who was cast against type as Wade 50 years ago, Crowe is a perfect fit. Not because of his bad boy behavior offscreen, but because he can blend charm and menace better than anyone."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,88,"Both actors are among the best, most intuitively creative we have, and whatever transpires offscreen in Crowe’s case, onscreen they only serve their characters. Neither man showboats here, and it’s a thrill to watch them work."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,88,"A riveting remake of a pretty terrific 1957 western about manhood, fatherhood and honor."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,83,"What Alfred Hitchcock once said about thrillers also applies to Westerns: The stronger the bad guy, the better the film. By that measure, 3:10 to Yuma is excellent."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,83,"Mangold delivers a taut modern take on a lesser classic, preserving the ""High Noon"" themes about doing the right thing against all odds, and injecting a more modern pacing and urgency without going overboard. His film isn't Leonard's classic, but it's a solid, genre-respecting Western in its own right."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,83,"A fine and sturdy picture, capable of standing alongside the many such films made when Westerns were one of our chief entertainments."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,80,A largely compelling ride on the strength of a powerful cast led by Russell Crowe and Christian Bale.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,80,"In this movie, Fonda really is iconic. 3:10 to Yuma may be familiar, but, at its best, it has a rapt quality, even an aura of wonder."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,80,James Mangold's remake walks a fine line in retaining many of the original's qualities while smartly shaking things up a bit.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,80,"Period westerns are so unfashionable and costly that they usually require a top-drawer script to get off the ground -- and this one, adapted from an Elmore Leonard story and its 1957 movie version, travels with an arrow's clean arc."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,80,"Who says remakes are always inferior to the original film? And who says the western is dead? Especially when a movie is as entertaining as this one, you begin to think this formerly beloved genre is due for a revival."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,78,"This film is an example of a Western that ought to appeal to a healthy-sized contemporary audience, and is also a remake of the 1957 film of the same name, which is a hallmark of the type of psychological Western."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,75,"This is how a Western today tries to give us more bang for the buck. By working this hard to be a crowd-pleaser, though, it may please fewer crowds."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,75,"The 30-minute finale, which includes a tense stand-off with Ben's gang, is masterfully executed. It's perfectly paced, suspenseful, and ends in a way that's both appropriate and satisfying."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,75,"Maybe this redo didn’t need so many bells and whistles, but Mangold brings it home."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,75,"Mangold has been smart or fortunate in casting, and personalities sustain interest even when the narrative flags."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,75,"Captures a potent sense of the Old West with its multidimensional raw performances and captivating final shootout sequence. But with its emphasis on emotional truths, it transcends the confines of a cowboy movie."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,75,"While the newer version's darker ending lends a more contemporary twist, overall 3:10 to Yuma is reverent to the original – a few more bullets and more spilled blood notwithstanding."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,75,An extremely well-acted and well-directed remake of a 1957 oater.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,75,"In the battle of the leading men, Crowe's character has a slight edge, and the actor really makes the most of it, showing us how boyishly mischievous charm and utter venality can exist without seeming contradiction in the same being. But Bale builds to a pretty impressive boil himself after laying back for about three quarters of the film."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,70,"What this version offers is the chance to watch Russell Crowe and Christian Bale—two of the more charismatic, macho leading men around--duke it out psychologically, while another fine but less well-known intensity artist, Ben Foster, steals"
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,70,"The movie's best performance belongs to Peter Fonda. Tough, terrific, and totally unrecognizable as a bounty hunter, this cantankerous old hippie is so leathery he deserves his own line of rawhide apparel."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,70,"Under Mangold’s sure if uninspired hand, the new Yuma is reasonably exciting and terse, and, like its predecessor, built around a memorable villain of ambiguous villainy."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,70,More likely to be recalled as a moderately satisfying entertainment than remembered as a classic.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,70,"Overall, the picture is accomplished, intelligent and, in places, a little dull. Mangold isn't an economical filmmaker, and parts of 3:10 to Yuma suffer from needless bloat. The new version doesn't use the same kind of blunt, visually arresting shorthand as Daves' original...And yet somehow, maybe just barely, Mangold -- succeeds on his own terms, largely because the actors he's working with here."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,70,"As Ben Wade, gang leader and murderer, he gives an ironic performance, but Crowe’s irony is more intense than other actors’ obsession. He turns the idea of having so few emotions--of being beyond caring--into a bloody joke. He upstages everyone with his laughing eyes."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,67,"The result bears so little resemblance to the original that you have to wonder what happened. It seems more a remake of ""How the West Was Won"" than 3:10 to Yuma."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,63,The acting is its chief strength. Russell Crowe brings a cocky charisma to Ben Wade.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,50,"The strengths of the first ""3:10 To Yuma"" were enhanced by its proportionality -- an intimate story told in 92 minutes. The story is no bigger in the new version, which goes on for 117 minutes. And it's certainly not better."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,50,The remake adds 24 minutes and subtracts most of the suspense.
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,90,"Robocop is as tightly worked as a film can be, not a moment or line wasted."
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,88,A first-rate production full of nonstop action and inventive special effects but what truly makes Robocop spellbinding is a superior script.
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,80,It was this love of mayhem combined with a biting comic attack on neo-fascist corporatism - most notably seen in the TV ads for products like the apocalyptic board game Nuke 'Em - which helped raise Robocop above the common sci-fi herd.
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,80,"With its droll underpinnings, Robocop does for cyborgs and Detroit what ""Blade Runner"" did for androids and L.A."
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,80,Robocop is one weird and entertaining hybrid of camp and sci-fi shoot-'em-up.
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,80,Robocop is a thriller with a difference.
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,75,"Paul Verhoeven, a Dutch director (""Soldier of Orange""), doesn't let the furiously futuristic plot get in the way of the flaming explosions, shattering glass and hurtling bodies."
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,75,Great effects and a nasty undercurrent drive this vehicle.
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,75,"The action is skillfully directed by Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven, and there are many bursts of razor-sharp social satire. But the story amounts to a celebration of brute force in a crudely etched law-and-order context."
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,70,"There's a brooding, agonized quality to the violence that almost seems subversive, as if Verhoeven were both appalled and fascinated by his complicity in the toxic action rot."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,88,"Red 2 not only delivers the action, laughs and thrills of the original — in many ways it surpasses it."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,75,"About halfway through Red 2, in the midst of all the laughs and action, suddenly Anthony Hopkins shows up, and he doesn't care one bit that nobody is going to notice his acting in a movie like this. He's going for the Oscar anyway."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,75,"The best thing about RED 2, like its predecessor, is its lightness of tone. Too many movies with comic-book roots come on too seriously, even when the comics themselves have a loose, fast, jocular wit about them."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,67,"Anthony Hopkins, new to the franchise, is introduced in a prison cell, in stir-crazy shades of Hannibal Lecter. At 53, Catherine Zeta-Jones is nearly too young for this stuff."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,67,"Like its predecessor, it’s a one-joke movie; the difference is that this time around, the joke is better."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,63,"In its long, punishing final act, Red 2 goes beyond its mandate as a lark to pose as a true action caper."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,63,"I did my homework and watched the original ""RED."" It was just as stupid as this movie, yet I liked it a little more."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,63,Red 2 is one of those sequels that's easier to follow if you've seen the original but more entertaining if you haven't.
RED 2,6.6,53262560,63,"The film has its charms but the end result feels like warmed-over James Bond… and not even especially good 007, at that."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,63,"Red 2 goes down easily, from Marvin’s demented moments of relationship advice to Dame Helen’s tender and amusing “Hitchcock” reunion with Sir Anthony. There’s a knowing twinkle in their eyes, and in everybody else’s.
“Yeah, we could’ve done a Bond film,” they seem to wink. “And it would’ve been a bloody fun one, at that.”"
RED 2,6.6,53262560,60,"A fun, frothy return for Frank and his creaky commandos."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,60,"It’s never laugh-out-loud funny or inside-track smart, but in a summer full of bombastic failures, a lack of pretense is enough."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,60,"Not that it isn’t entertaining, but the film's premise is certainly well past its “use by” date, resulting in another passably palatable sequel distinguished by a lack of narrative and stylistic coherence that could potentially underpin a really viable franchise."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,60,"While Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, et al. are still good for a few chuckles as a gang of superannuated government assassins, this globe-trotting action-comedy diversion applies a bigger-is-better philosophy across the board, upping the stakes, the firepower and the travel budget, but keeping real thrills and laughs at a modest trickle."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,58,"It’s nice to see oldsters cavorting in kaboom movies, but a little of this stuff goes a long way."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,58,"Overall, this is an action-comedy that should be as full of laughs as it is explosions (So. Many. Explosions.), but there’s little joy other than letting Mirren be (super) sexy and Malkovich deliver a few good lines."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,54,Every double-cross and ticking clock is familiar in the worst ways.
RED 2,6.6,53262560,50,"No movie with this much ass-kicking should feel so lifeless. Nothing in Red 2 is actively offensive, but for the most part, it’s hard to really care for anything that’s happening to these characters."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,50,"What pops more than the gunfire are the line readings, where Ms. Parker, especially, but also Mr. Malkovich and Ms. Mirren, can give personality to standard action repartee."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,50,"Willis appears to have finally grown bored of his own shtick, and Malkovich spends most of the movie looking humiliated."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,50,Red 2 is much more of a mixed bag than it should have been.
RED 2,6.6,53262560,50,"Red 2 is not just a bad movie, it’s bad karma. And the target audience of adult moviegoers who respect the names in its once-vital cast have a bull’s-eye on their collective cranium."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,50,"There is a fine line between silly dumb fun and out-and-out stupidity, and “Red 2” crosses it one time too many."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,50,My favorite thing in the movie is the way co-star and Korean action icon Byung Hun Lee uses his feet of fury to hoist a paint can and send it flying.
RED 2,6.6,53262560,50,"It’s all supremely silly stuff, and amusingly so, as long as you don’t stop to think about all those blameless officers and agents cut down in the line of mindless entertainment."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,50,"A sequel that has some snappy interplay, typically courtesy of Malkovich, but mostly feels like a cast working to manufacture what came naturally the first time."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,50,"Red 2, disappointing in so many ways, isn't torture to watch, in part because Mirren has even more to do than she did in the first installment."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,40,"Dean Parisot, who made the delightful Galaxy Quest, has a funnier sensibility than the first movie’s director, Robert Schwentke, but he’s still defeated by a script that’s over-complicated and under-sophisticated."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,40,"Like the first one, it's played for laughs in-between bouts of mayhem; most of the gags are off-target, though Mirren's Nancy Mitfordesque assassin gets a pretty good kill ratio."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,40,Returning screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber have penned a surplus of minor melees and major set-pieces.
RED 2,6.6,53262560,40,You can color me unimpressed.
RED 2,6.6,53262560,40,"Any movie that gives Helen Mirren a chance to shoot really big guns, wear an ermine astrakhan and channel Bette Davis as Queen Elizabeth can't be all bad, and Red 2 isn't, though it comes close."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,40,"As in the first film, the seasoned-pro cast provides the few fleeting pleasures to be found."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,37,The bigger surprise is just how clunky and unsatisfying this follow-up feels.
RED 2,6.6,53262560,30,"The focus is much more on Sarah, Frank, and their repetitive, ugly dynamic than on the giddy elements that made the first film trashy fun."
RED 2,6.6,53262560,25,How many Oscar winners does it take to save the world? Red 2 gathers together a collection of lauded thespians – from A(nthony Hopkins) to (Catherine) Z(eta-Jones) – and leaves them to float on a sea of action-flick clichés.
RED 2,6.6,53262560,25,How bad could the boneyard be compared to sitting through this execrable piece of non-entertainment? Better dead than RED 2.

Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,60,"This Trinity may be the least of the three--sound familiar, Matrix faithful?--but it's the closest in style and attitude to a pulpy comic book, an art form that doesn't need to be lofty, perfect or even sensible to tickle a dork's fancy."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,58,"Blunt-witted, visually pedestrian, and overly long, with too many scenes of Blade and his cohorts standing around in darkened corridors, waiting for their enemies to show up. The action, however, is as throat-grabbing as you want it to be."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,50,"Director Goyer, who wrote all three Blade films, deserves credit for sticking with the character, but aside from the effectively staged action sequences Trinity is cheap-looking and laughably inept."

Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,50,The story is a comic-book tale at its most basic level.
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,50,"One of the prime laws of the multiplex states that any action or horror movie series will devolve into ritualized violence, self-mocking camp, and egregious silliness by part three. Blade: Trinity is right on schedule."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,50,Big and dumb and loud and entirely past its prime.
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,42,"Has a surprising number of problems: dire scripting, sloppy plotting and coffee-jittery editing, for starters. But its biggest problem is that Blade himself takes a back seat to a host of new and mostly uninteresting characters."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,40,"A choppy, forgetful, suspense-free romp that substitutes campy humor for chills."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,40,"By and large, the jokes fall flat, and the entire film often seems as fatigued as its star."

Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,38,"A mess. It lacks the sharp narrative line and crisp comic-book clarity of the earlier films, and descends too easily into shapeless fight scenes that are chopped into so many cuts that they lack all form or rhythm."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,30,There's nothing beneath the flashy editing and self-consciously cool production design but a soulless adrenaline machine that's never scary and rarely engrossing.
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,30,"The movie is loud, dark, bumpy and not even a little fun. You emerge into daylight bruised and battered, suffering a case of movie abuse."

Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,5.5,52210049,80,"""Star Trek V"" is pretty much of a mess - a movie that betrays all the signs of having gone into production at a point where the script doctoring should have begun in earnest. There is no clear line from the beginning of the movie to the end, not much danger, no characters to really care about, little suspense, uninteresting or incomprehensible villains, and a great deal of small talk and pointless dead ends. Of all of the ""Star Trek"" movies, this is the worst."
Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,5.5,52210049,63,"On the whole, Star Trek V is a highly forgettable motion picture, regardless of whether you're looking at it from the perspective of a Trek lover or a movie-goer."

Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,5.5,52210049,63,"""Star Trek V"" is a shambles, a space plodessy, a snoozola of astronomic proportions. The story is uneventful, the effects warmed over from ""Star Wars."""

The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,70,Lavish in its approach -- it attempts some rather extravagant battle scenes -- yet it still seems modest in its goals: It's more interested in being a Saturday-afternoon entertainment than a blockbuster.
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,67,"The plot is negligible, but that's fine since it's really only a way to get from one set-piece to another."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,63,"The special effects are effective, though not terribly special. While director Minkoff pays homage to past masters of the genre, the past masters were better at this game than he."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,63,"Although veteran choreographer Yuen Woo-Ping ( Kill Bill, The Matrix) handles the wire action, the camera work is merely okay and the sequences are on the familiar side. Still, it's fun to see Chan resurrect his loopy, staggering ""drunken master"" fighting style."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,63,It's good-natured myth-making cut into kid-size pieces.

The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,60,"Taken as a whole, though, it's an amiable lost-and-found of epic-adventure tropes. As I still illogically treasure ""Willow,"" many a 10-year-old who sees Forbidden Kingdom will remember it fondly in spite of its flaws."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,60,"The wisecracking Chan and the stoic Li play off their on-screen images with good humor, and if they don't have the agility they once did, it's still a joy to watch them make the most of Yuen Woo-ping's impressive choreography."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,60,"A dance of combat and humor saves a contrivance from drowning. Or, rather, Chan and Li elevate it enough to make it into a good time."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,60,"The missing link between '00s wushu, '80s kids' fantasy and '70s chop-socky, this manages to be thoroughly entertaining - and the face-off between Chan and Li is worth the entrance price alone."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,58,"Minkoff lets the fight scenes go on for a while, which is nice, and all the best bits are in the middle, when Jackie and Jet spend a lot of time playing off each other."

The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,50,"It's perhaps best suited for genre vets who can be satisfied with spot-the-reference games and Chan and Li's chemistry, or for undiscriminating kids who'll enjoy the ""Karate Kid"" vibe. But it's less a culmination of Li and Chan's careers than a passable footnote to better things."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,50,"At best, The Forbidden Kingdom counts as an amiable time-waster for kids, but much more should be expected from the momentous union of two kung-fu titans."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,50,"Pairing Jackie Chan and Jet Li would seem like a slam dunk, but this big-budget martial arts drama, which borrows liberally from ""The Wizard of Oz,"" is something of a disappointment."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,50,"There's nothing really wrong with all this in theory, but the overall doofiness of the execution is finally too much to overcome. The filmmakers come off like their protagonist, wide-eyed tourists in an exotic realm. If you've been looking for a martial arts film to take granny and the kids to, this might be the one, but a Jackie Chan-Jet Li collaboration deserves better than that."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,50,"Feels a bit too much like six hours of movie packed into 113 minutes - imagine if New Line had made Peter Jackson cram the entirety of ""Lord of the Rings"" into one film."

Underworld,7,51970690,75,"At heart, this is an old-fashioned monster flick decked out with Hollywood's full battery of high-tech visual effects. It's as goofy as it is gory -- stay away if you don't like in-your-face mayhem."
Underworld,7,51970690,75,"It's Shakespearean in its political machinations and closer to ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Starship Troopers"" than to ""Dracula"" or ""The Howling."""
Underworld,7,51970690,75,"However much Underworld recycles elements from other films, it carries us into a well-constructed, convincingly scary world worth visiting."
Underworld,7,51970690,75,"The filmmakers' decision to go with prosthetic enhancements rather than CGI gives the snouts, fangs and snapping jaws a refreshingly tactile look."
Underworld,7,51970690,67,It is the perfectly cast Beckinsale who lifts Underworld out and away from the films many moments of silly gravitas and steers it into a truly interesting take on the whole vampires 'n' werewolves genre.
Underworld,7,51970690,63,"Riddled with ammunition for what Alfred Hitchcock called the ""Plausibles""--those poor-sport moviegoers who insist on pointing out a movie's inconsistencies instead of simply enjoying the ride"
Underworld,7,51970690,63,"An example of a vampire movie for the new century -- stylish, gothic, gory, and loud."
Underworld,7,51970690,63,"As murky and derivative-looking as the film is, it moves with an authority that pummels you into submission."
Underworld,7,51970690,63,"Has one other thing in common with ""The Matrix Reloaded"" -- too much story, too many angles."
Underworld,7,51970690,60,"Visually it's wild fun, since fledgling feature director Len Wiseman started off in production design, and creature designer Patrick Tatopoulos's diverse credits span from ""Godzilla"" to ""Stuart Little."" Yet with Underworld's guilty pleasures come copious clinkers, from its nuts-and-bolts narrative foundation to Wiseman's inability to direct actors beyond cartoonish interaction."
Underworld,7,51970690,60,"The funny thing about all this is that a half-hour into Underworld I couldn't wait for it to be over. When it really was over, I couldn't wait for the next installment. Go figure."
Underworld,7,51970690,50,Takes itself so seriously that it never has fun with its shopworn genre elements.
Underworld,7,51970690,50,"Alas, as is often the case with lower-end genre movies, the story cooked up by Wiseman and his friends, actor Kevin Grevioux and the film's screenwriter, Danny McBride, is decidedly less important than the look of the film and its influences."
Underworld,7,51970690,50,"It's so impossible to care about the characters in the movie that I didn't care if the vampires or werewolves won. I might not have cared in a better movie, either, but I might have been willing to pretend."
Underworld,7,51970690,50,"Though it sometimes feels as if it's four hours long, Underworld has going for it an intriguing fantasy premise, an eventful plot and a look that is diverting, if finally a bit monotonous."
Underworld,7,51970690,50,"A loud and relentlessly overstated B-movie, and yet not entirely stupid."
Underworld,7,51970690,50,"All of this is accomplished with buckets of blood, but almost no sense of flesh: It's hard to recall a more sexless vampire flick."
Underworld,7,51970690,50,A slick disappointment -- though there's much unintentional humor to be enjoyed.
Underworld,7,51970690,50,"By the end, I was starting to ponder questions like, If a vampire mates with a lycan-vamp hybrid, which parent will have to convert?"
Underworld,7,51970690,40,"Beautiful in its dark, contrasting blues and blacks, Underworld is nonetheless a remarkably humorless movie, and not even the adroitly hammy Bill Nighy, as the vampire king, can leaven the overwrought seriousness of it all."
Underworld,7,51970690,40,Beckinsale delivers even if Underworld doesn't quite manage to follow through on its initial promise.
Underworld,7,51970690,40,"Achieves only loudness, aggressive confusion and one of the silliest head-splittings in film history."
Underworld,7,51970690,40,"So clotted with back story that the Romeo and Juliet-style romance between a warrior vampire and a reluctant werewolf never has a chance to breath, Len Wiseman's revisionist horror tale is all look and no bite."
Underworld,7,51970690,40,"This is the silliest horror movie I've seen in years, though some of the special effects are pretty good."
Underworld,7,51970690,38,"A hollow, relentless mess."
Underworld,7,51970690,30,Plays less like a novel re-imagining of a classic if campy narrative than a drearily self-conscious exercise in Know Your Film References.
Underworld,7,51970690,30,There's too much pretension in this film. Lots of intense stares into the camera. Lots of uncomfortably hip clothes. Lots of pompous names for themselves.
Underworld,7,51970690,30,125 minutes is a long time to stare at a movie that's basically in bleached blue-and-white with occasional splotches of brick red. The palette reinforces the monotony of the storyline.
Underworld,7,51970690,30,"Not since ""Battlefield Earth"" pitted overacting, nine-foot-tall Psychlos against puny man-animals has there been an interspecies match-up this perversely uninteresting."
Underworld,7,51970690,25,"Neither side is worth rooting for in this ridiculous blood feud, which features some of the year's most laughable dialogue."
Underworld,7,51970690,25,"Could use script transfusion, or at least a few quarts of levity."
Underworld,7,51970690,25,"""Your incompetence is most taxing,"" says the chief vampire (Bill Nighy). A line that pretty much nails this rusty Blade."

Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,80,"Directed by the team of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, the new film brings all the cartoonish insanity of the pair's Crank saga to the -- let's face it -- cartoonishly insane concept of the Ghost Rider, a burning skeleton in leather who rides an equally fiery motorcycle. It's a match made in, er, hell."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,63,"A goofy, gonzo thrill ride, “Vengeance” is a bad movie sequel so bad it’s good, a bad movie that’s almost a great bad movie."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,60,"This doesn't lack for crazy charm, particularly when Nicolas Cage (in his go-for-broke Bad Lieutenant mode) and Ciaran Hinds (playing the devil) try to out-weird each other with broad, even cartoonish performances."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,60,"The film, though, has some redeeming qualities, including the presence of Idris Elba as the obligatory good guy, who encourages Johnny to get Danny into the protective custody of a religious order."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,50,"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance offers Cage plenty of opportunities to tap his inner circus geek, to twitch, cackle and flail without shame, going full tilt batwing crazy. Not since he danced in a pagan bear suit in The Wicker Man has Cage appeared this unconcerned about what the audience will think."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,50,"The smugness of the film grows wearying long before the end. Just because the people on and behind the camera are willing to acknowledge what we're watching is ridiculous crap doesn't really change the fact that, well, it is."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,50,"Spirit of Vengeance is so focused and, as a result, so impoverished that you actually feel bad for Cage. The actor tries to bring the weird (though at this point one wonders if he can even do anything else) but the film more often than not leaves him high and dry, saddling him with standard-issue action hero lines and boilerplate action set-pieces."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,50,"Cage-ophiles will find some delectable freakouts in Blaze's transformation - or near transformation - scenes. Otherwise, the committee-penned script combines yokel-friendly haw-haw irreverence (non-sequitur cutaways to the Rider pissing in a flamethrower pattern) and sweaty monologues about ""controlling the Rider"" (the character is basically a mean drunk's superhero)."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,50,"So it's a half-certainty, half-shock that Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is both good and bad, a sequel that's hungry for thrills but bereft of the cohesiveness - and budget - to be a full meal."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,40,"The picture is still much too rickety, slapdash and surprisingly dull to qualify as a good barrel-bottom pleasure."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,40,"With his (Cage) over-the-top delivery and operatically intense facial expressions, there's no way anyone could accuse him of phoning this one in."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,40,"Alas, unlike the duo's Crank films - also about a hero on the verge of explosion - Spirit of Vengeance lacks a solid gimmick to unify their transgressive gambits."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,40,"The first ""Ghost Rider"" film, directed by Mark Steven Johnson, was sort of a fizzy goof, the kind of movie where you don't expect much and then think, ""Hey, that was actually kind of fun."" Spirit of Vengeance, though, is undone by increased expectations, as promising more only makes it feel they are somehow delivering less."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,40,"A water-treading sequel offering just enough kooky color to keep less-discerning funnybook fans occupied, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance nudges its obscure hero's mythology forward a bit without seeming to care much how it gets there."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,40,"Like ""Ghost Rider: Low Voltage,"" this is a surprisingly underpowered excursion into Marvel's mad world by Neveldine and Taylor. More purgatory than hellfire."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,33,"The charismatic Idris Elba debuts in a key role as an alcoholic priest who recruits Cage's unique services. Yet instead of elevating the franchise, Ghost Rider: Spirit Of Vengeance ends up squandering even more potential."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,33,"Most of the movie's action-horror set pieces play like lame Gwar music video outtakes, and Cage's signature mix of irony and off-the-rails mugging only works when you can see the actor's face. In Ghost Rider form, his character is just a skeletal automaton with neither a tongue nor a cheek to put it in."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,30,"This time out, the action is in 3-D, which amounts to a few shots of flaming motorcycle parts comin' at ya, but little else."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,25,"For acting to be this bad in movie not directed by Michael Bay or George Lucas, it has to be intentional."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,25,The only part of this movie anyone's ever going to remember is the pair of scenes in which Ghost Rider pees flame.
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,12,"To question where things went wrong feels somehow strange, as the project seems to have been ill-conceived from the very start."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,0,One look at the dreadful mess that is Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance will turn your whisper into a primal Cage scream: MAKE THIS MOVIE STOP!
Exit Wounds,5.6,51758599,67,"In its low grade way, this blithely brutal cops and drugs thriller is an efficient hot wire entertainment."
Exit Wounds,5.6,51758599,60,"Silver, manages the deft balance of making Seagal seem both genuinely courageous and charmingly blockheaded."
Exit Wounds,5.6,51758599,50,"In Seagal's movies, the interesting stuff never derives from what happens, but rather from how it happens. Exit Wounds is certainly one of his best efforts, although the distinction is a dubious one at best."
Exit Wounds,5.6,51758599,50,"It's a pastiche of pulpy elements culled from all the ""Dirty Harry"" movies you can think of."
Exit Wounds,5.6,51758599,40,"The small reward is the cool, confident presence of DMX, who shows signs of being a great leading man. But only in a much smarter, more original movie."
Exit Wounds,5.6,51758599,38,"Viewers who sit through Exit Wounds should at least do themselves the favor of staying for the end credits, which feature some truly funny off-color banter between Anderson and Arnold on the latter's ostensible talkshow."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,90,"It's a fine, tough little movie, technically assured and brutally efficient, with a simple story that ventures into some profound existential territory without making a big fuss about it."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,88,Sit through the entire credits. There's one more shot still to come. Not that you wouldn't be content without it.
The Grey,6.8,51580136,83,"Genre movies are often mere excuses for shows of gore and tricked-up suspense, and while The Grey should satisfy anyone who seeks only that there's something more profound and pure at its heart, making it a genuinely entertaining thriller that puts a chill through you in more ways than one."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,80,"I pretty much loved this movie from start to finish - risible implausibilities, insufficiently explained premise and all. An admirably spare survival thriller, The Grey (nice title!) abounds in qualities that are rare in movies of its type. It's quiet, contemplative, and almost haiku-like in its simplicity."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,80,"What is surprising is how poetic the movie is, partly thanks to its high-lonesome sound design and the desolate beauty of its visuals, but mostly because of its star, Liam Neeson."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,80,The gristle inside this movie is one of the things that save it from being simply a series of challenges.
The Grey,6.8,51580136,80,"Like Anthony Mann's ""The Naked Spur"" (1953) or ""Man of the West"" (1958), the movie draws on the terrifying beauty of the natural world and generates tension from the volatile dynamics of a carefully observed group."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,78,The film is an intelligent study of the will to live. It's so strong that even a suicidal man rises to the occasion.
The Grey,6.8,51580136,75,"There's an almost poetic quality to the way things develop, with characters becoming increasingly introspective."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,75,"Forsaken in a cruel wilderness, a man looks to God and pleads for help. Receiving no answer, he says, ""F- -k, I'll do it myself."""
The Grey,6.8,51580136,75,"The setting and fatalistic musings of The Grey invite comparison to Sean Penn's stirring 2007 ad­ven­ture ""Into the Wild""; in its more metaphysical moments, told in impressionistic flashbacks, it recalls last year's ""The Tree of Life."""
The Grey,6.8,51580136,75,"A terrifically exciting, deeply unsettling survivalist epic."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,75,"Call The Grey ""Deliverance"" Lite, with snow, and wolves. And call it a solid January surprise."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,75,"The Grey avoids smug clichés, takes you to places you least expect and settles for no comfortable solutions, while it explores the dark shadows of the male psyche and finds more emotional fragility there than you find in the usual phony macho myths from Hollywood."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,75,"There's little in Joe Carnahan's previous films, marked by their frenetic, fanboy-friendly overindulgences, to predict the cold blast of The Grey, an old-fashioned, neatly arrayed survival story that almost reads like a reaction to the excesses of his past work."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,70,"Mr. Carnahan has till now been pigeonholed, and rightly, by comedy shoot-'em-ups like ""Smokin' Aces"" and ""The A-Team."" But here he is with The Grey - certainly an adventure film but one with a spiritual ingredient that is both surprising and fiercely resonant."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,70,"True to its grim prospectus, The Grey dwells in haunted machismo to the very end."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,70,"Don't be mistaken -- this isn't an artsy thriller. It is still, at heart, men vs. wolves, and the wolves definitely have the home-court advantage."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,70,"The Grey, a man's-man of a genre picture that will satisfy the action audience while reminding more discerning viewers what they saw in director Joe Carnahan's decade-old breakthrough, ""Narc."""
The Grey,6.8,51580136,65,"The movie might not be a vengeance-driven wolf-man cage fight, but in subverting those escapist expectations, it sinks its teeth far deeper and more memorably."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,63,"The film sustains some suspense and brooding atmosphere for its first half, but eventually the clichés of character and dialogue drag it struggling to ground."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,63,"The Grey, whose clipped title, grim swagger, and lost-in-the-outback themes conjure up visions of that Alec Baldwin/Anthony Hopkins classic, ""The Edge,"" devolves into a predictable man-against-nature, and man-against-fellow man, affair."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,63,"At times, the animatronic effects used to create the wolves are too obvious, and the one-by-one kill-off plotline employed in so many horror films gives The Grey a plodding predictability. At nearly two hours, it's also too long."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,60,"Moment to moment, the film is gripping and beautiful to behold (props to cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi for the mesmerizingly grainy, achromatic visuals). But caveat emptor to those expecting a hinterlands gloss on ""Taken"" with rapacious curs in place of nefarious Albanians."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,58,"Neeson brings gravitas to the table, acting as a legitimizing counterweight to the overwrought dialogue and flesh-tearing lupine hysteria. But in a scenario this persistently ludicrous, he can only do so much."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,58,"You see the pattern here? Winter-release slot + travel budget + Liam Neeson = slightly preposterous, routinely violent, apparently lucrative action movie in which the Irish-born star signals inner emotional conflict with his handsomely mashed boxer's face while settling outer physical conflict with his boxer's fists."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,50,"Neeson's gravity elevates the action, and there's a fine, prickly performance by an actor new to me, Frank Grillo, as the asshole of the group. But The Grey, despite moments of sublimity, is as predictable as a funeral. When Ottway angrily calls out to God, the nonanswer is sadly redundant."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,50,The computer-generated wolves have more personality than any of the dull characters in The Grey.
The Grey,6.8,51580136,50,"It's cheap the way The Grey wants to be both a Liam Neeson ""Quit Taking My Stuff'' movie and an existential thriller about survival."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,50,The picture's dialogue-heavy stretches and ambiguous finale could leave ticketbuyers impatient for less chatter and more chomping.
The Grey,6.8,51580136,40,"There's too much Jack London, and, as they systematically pick off the stragglers, too many CGI wolves go unpunched."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,40,"This is admirably ambitious, but Carnahan's not nearly good enough a writer or director to pull it off: the results are portentous, muddled and not nearly as entertaining as Neeson's usual face-punching antics."
The Grey,6.8,51580136,25,A handsome but gabby take on the standard survivalist thriller that's more concerned with lofty metaphysics than which poor blockhead is about to bite it next.
The Grey,6.8,51580136,25,Carnahan didn't make a movie unfit for mankind but it certainly isn't worth mankind's money.
The Grey,6.8,51580136,25,"Neeson is always compelling, even in a movie as ridiculous as The Grey."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,80,"Timothy Dalton's monogamous, deadpan 007 brings a more nuanced interpretation to the central character, whose relationships evolve in ways rarely seen in the earlier films."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,80,"Confused plot and digressive globe trotting notwithstanding, the best Bond in years."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,80,"007's latest, The Living Daylights, a snazzy spy thriller, is all the more alluring for its new conservatism. It's right up there with the early Bonds, though not in the league with Goldfinger. But oh, what a difference."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,80,"You may not like Timothy Dalton as Bond, but the fact is they could put a trained seal in the role and the movies would be basically the same. And by those standards, this one is pretty good."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,75,"Director John Glen is an old hand at James Bond films, having worked on three other 007 movies. He knows this popular spy well and does him great service in this well-paced film."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,75,"In The Living Daylights, Dalton establishes his claim to the role; in the films that will follow, he'll have the chance to dig deeper."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,70,"Mr. Dalton, the latest successor to the role of James Bond, is well equipped for his new responsibilities."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,70,"With a hint of that my-way problem-solving approach, The Living Daylights freshens the Bond series’ cornball formula elements while reprising details that had made director John Glen’s debut, For Your Eyes Only, such a superior outing."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,70,Dalton shows a serious side that's been missing from the role since Sean Connery's earliest 007 days.
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,70,"After the fizzle of the later Roger Moore Bonds, The Living Daylights brings in a new 007 in Timothy Dalton, who manages the Connery trick of seeming suave and tough at the same time, and tried to get away from the weak comedy in favour of proper international intrigue."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,60,"Dalton has training in classical theater; he has pedigree, looks, class. But as Bond he is – face it – dull as dirt. Too much spoofing is bad (see Moore), none is deadly (see Dalton)."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,50,"I'll be among the first to admit that Timothy Dalton is a fine actor. But giving a solid performance has little to do with being a good James Bond, and, as accomplished as Dalton is, he's a failure as 007 in The Living Daylights."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,50,"Timothy Dalton stars as the 1987 model James Bond in this 15th entry in the series, with the usual assortment of dope smugglers, KGB operatives, and criminal psychos providing a few anxious moments at the welcoming party. Expect the expected."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,50,"Without a great Bond girl, a great villain or a hero with a sense of humor, The Living Daylights belongs somewhere on the lower rungs of the Bond ladder. But there are some nice stunts."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,50,"Bond is impersonated by 007 newcomer Timothy Dalton, who does little that's identifiable as acting, although he looks the part. Come back, Sean, all is forgiven!"
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,42,"I feel just rotten about this, but I'm afraid I've outgrown James."
Goldfinger,7.7,51081062,100,"Of all the Bonds, Goldfinger is the best, and can stand as a surrogate for the others. If it is not a great film, it is a great entertainment, and contains all the elements of the Bond formula that would work again and again."
Goldfinger,7.7,51081062,100,"Not just my favourite Bond movie, but the standard by which all other Bond movies must be judged. It has Sean Connery, of course, and the best theme song, incorporating Shirley Bassey and lashings of John Barry brass...And it has the best villain."
Goldfinger,7.7,51081062,100,"Larger than life, faintly ridiculous, completely cool, Goldfinger is the quintessential James Bond movie."
Goldfinger,7.7,51081062,100,"It's phenomenal! A rare case in film history that a series projecting the same character, with the same star, improves as it goes along. The James Bond movies do. The first, ""Dr. No,"" was good; the second, ""From Russia With Love,"" was better; the best and the wildest is Goldfinger, a fun galore thriller that is one of the brightest lights of the holiday offerings on screens of De Mille and Coronet Theatres."
Goldfinger,7.7,51081062,100,"Goldfinger contains more crowd-pleasing moments than any other Bond film, including Oddjob's flying bowler, a laser beam that almost emasculates Bond, the lavishly accessorized Aston Martin DB5, and the bizarre murder of Goldfinger's secretary (Shirley Eaton): she's gilded to death. It also features Shirley Bassey's terrific rendition of the Leslie Bricusse-Anthony Newley title song."
Goldfinger,7.7,51081062,90,There's not the least sign of staleness in this third sample of the Bond 007 formula. Some liberties have been taken with Ian Fleming's original novel but without diluting its flavor.
Goldfinger,7.7,51081062,90,"This 1964 entry is the most enjoyable of the James Bond thrillers starring Sean Connery—perhaps because it's the most comic and cartoony in look as well as conception. Still, it's every bit as imperialist and misogynistic as the other screen adventures based on Ian Fleming's books."
Goldfinger,7.7,51081062,90,"A bit much? Yes, but it's meant to be. Like Doctor No and From Russia with Love, the two previous Bond bombshells, this picture is a thriller exuberantly travestied. No doubt Goldfinger's formula for box-office gold contains entirely too much brass, but who cares? In scene after scene Director Guy Hamilton has contrived some hilariously horrible sight gags."
Goldfinger,7.7,51081062,88,"Goldfinger is studded with moments that have since become deeply embedded in the Bond mythos. John Barry's opening song (sung by Shirley Bassey) is among the series' best. Snippets of dialogue have attained an almost-legendary status, such as the exchange when Goldfinger is about to emasculate 007 with a laser. ""Do you expect me to talk?"" asks Bond. The response is succinct: ""No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"""
Goldfinger,7.7,51081062,80,"It holds the attention of the audience from brazen start to fantastic finish – well, not quite to the silly end, perhaps, but then we can’t have everything."
Goldfinger,7.7,51081062,60,"Any kid growing up in the early ’60s will remember this one for several reasons: Birley Shassey’s screamer of a theme; Bond’s shocking use of a beautiful girl as a human shield; bullion-obsessed baddie Auric Goldfinger’s top hat-wielding henchman, Oddjob; Honor Blackman’s risquely monikered Pussy Galore; and, above all, Bond’s stupendous, gadget-infested silver Aston Martin DB5, the car that spurred a thousand Corgi purchases."
Goldfinger,7.7,51081062,50,"What they give us in Goldfinger is an excess of  science-fiction fun, a mess of mechanical melodrama, and a minimum of bedroom farce...It is good fun, all right, fast and furious, racing hither and yon about the world as Double-Oh Seven pursues the intrigues of a mysterious financier named Goldfinger."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,100,"Mel Gibson is always good for a surprise, and his latest is that Apocalypto is a remarkable film. Set in the waning days of the Mayan civilization, the picture provides a trip to a place one's never been before, offering hitherto unseen sights of exceptional vividness and power."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,100,"For those of us who prefer to judge Gibson solely in terms of his art, the movie is a virtuosic piece of action cinema -- particularly in its second half...And while there has been no shortage of recent films that decry the horrors of war and man's inhumanity to his fellow man, I know of none other quite this sickeningly powerful."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,100,"The production design is superb, and the actors deliver their dialogue in subtitled Yucatecan Maya, but despite all the anthropological drag, this is really just a crackerjack Saturday-afternoon serial."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,91,"For all its excesses, it's an absorbing, disturbing, savagely beautiful ""trip"" movie, and an extraordinary -- perhaps even outrageous -- personal vision of the one A-list filmmaker who truly deserves the adjective ""maverick."""
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,90,"Gibson may not be much of a deep thinker, but he's a heck of a storyteller. Apocalypto turns out to be not a case of Montezuma's revenge but of Gibson's: It's something entirely unexpected, a sinewy, taut poem of action."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,88,Gibson has made a film of blunt provocation and bruising beauty.
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,88,"Barbarously beautiful and gut-wrenchingly (literally) violent, it's a mesmerizing vision of the past refracted through the dark obsessions of the present."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,88,"Awe-inspiring and harrowing, vile and beautiful, as wild and mesmerizing as the Mexican jungle in which it is filmed and one of the most relentlessly thrilling films of the year."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,88,"The heart of the matter - and the viscera - is the action, and one man's determination to survive. Apocalypto is primal."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,88,"The best thing I can say about Apocalypto is that, despite belonging to an overpopulated genre, it's unlike any other movie to reach theaters this year and, because it is as visual an experience as it is visceral, it is best seen on a large screen."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,83,"The whole film is too reliant on action-movie cuts and zooms, plus James Horner's insistent score, but it's beautifully rendered and convincingly exciting."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,80,The guy knows how to make a heart-pounding movie; he just happens to be a cinematic sadist.
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,80,"The film is mostly successful in transporting the viewer to another age: the costumes, the body markings, the fierce Mayan masks, all feel right. And keeping the dialogue in subtitles was a smart move. Even better are the faces, which never fail to fascinate. But for all the anthropological research that went into the movie, what is Apocalypto trying to say?"
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,80,"Apocalypto turns into the best ""Rambo"" movie ever made. The worrisome part is that Gibson doesn't think he's making a boneheaded action picture. For him, torture and vengeance are the way of the world. This is Gibsonian metaphysics."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,80,"That is the thing about Gibson, fool that he is in other ways: he has learned how to tell a tale, and to raise a pulse in the telling. You have to admire that basic gift, uncommon as it is in Hollywood these days."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,80,"Apocalypto is a dazzling achievement. Not only does it showcase a civilization little seen on the silver screen, the film (which opens with a quote from Will Duant) also advances larger questions about the natural and unnatural life cycles of civilizations."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,78,"There's so much dark material jammed into this complicated, conflicted, challenging, and charismatic man's (Gibson) own noggin that sometimes he knows not, I think, what he's done. Here, behold, Mel Gibson has made the weirdest, most violent movie of the year."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,75,"Say what you will about Gibson, but he's a genuine filmmaker, and Apocalypto gallops along the thin line between the deluded and the inspired with such conviction that you're yanked into its wake."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,75,"It's possible for a despicable heart and mind to make great art. And if Gibson hasn't quite done that with Apocalypto, he's nevertheless made an impressive and engrossing film. If you choose out of hand to miss it, which is your right, you'll be missing something."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,75,"Say what you want about Mel Gibson, but that sadomasochistic anti-Semite knows how to shoot a movie."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,70,Apocalypto exists solely as an action-adventure and a deft cinematic demonstration of man's capacity for cruelty. This is the true passion of Mel.
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,63,"A lotta woe to sit through, with not much to think about and only one matter to address. After the two hours-plus have sped by with brutal alacrity, all that's left is for the survivors of the bloodbath to hose down and suss out a ""new beginning."" I'm still searching for mine, but you might have better luck."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,63,"Gibson is a primitive all right, but so were Cecil B. DeMille and D.W. Griffith, and somehow we survived their idiocies."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,60,"Neither Mr. Gibson’s fans nor his detractors are likely to accuse him of excessive subtlety, and the effectiveness of Apocalypto is inseparable from its crudity. But the blunt characterizations and the emphatic emotional cues are also evidence of the director’s skill."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,60,"Dextrous with the action-adventure elements but clumsy in its handling of the central message, Apocalypto is a strange but largely entertaining mix of action, bloodletting, chin-rubbing and arthouse trimmings."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,60,"It's difficult to imagine the target audience for this film. Gangbangers, perhaps?"
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,58,"With ""Braveheart,"" ""Passion"" and now Apocalypto, Gibson clearly has established his priorities as a director. History is gore, plus a few hearthside family interludes. The trick is instilling the audience with enough rageful bloodlust to make the story work."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,50,"Numerous good things can be said about Apocalypto, the director's foray into the decaying Mayan civilization of the early 1500s, but every last one of them is overshadowed by Gibson's well-established penchant for depictions of stupendous amounts of violence."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,50,"I could go on about the beautifully detailed production design, the fresh performances from unknown and often nonprofessional actors, blabbety blah. But praising the movie's craftsmanship seems less urgent than communicating the overwhelming experience of watching it: the clammy, claustrophobic dread of being trapped in a torture chamber."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,50,"Gibson sure knows how to shoot a sequence, but he also doesn't know when to stop with the blood, gore and maiming."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,50,"Yet Apocalypto has to be respected for the sheer audacity of it, for the commitment and ambition behind it, and for its presentation of a complete other world. It is the furthest thing from a cynical or casual piece of work. It's crazy, and it moves."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,50,"But even those who succumb to his primitive, survivalist vision may resent the way he presents every kind of atrocity at least twice without illuminating any of the exotic details once."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,42,"Not just a walk in the park with Mel and the guys (in this case a large cast of mainly Mexican Indians speaking present- day Yucatec), this lavishly punishing picture is the third panel in Gibson's ""Ordeal"" triptych. The Martyrdom of the Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ have nothing on The Misadventures of the Jaguar Paw."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,40,"A relentlessly gruesome, visually impressive and ultimately not very interesting movie with some pretensions to seriousness."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,40,"The movie is so impressionistic, it obfuscates any sense of history. We expect at least a hint at the causes of the Mayan Empire's demise, but instead we get Mesoamerican Rambo."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,38,"It's ""Braveheart"" without historical significance and ""Passion"" without spirituality, though it dabbles in both, and it represents as brazen an act of career suicide as I can recall from a star director. If he were a first-timer, he'd never work again."
The Net,5.9,50727965,83,"This stuff is so concocted I had no business caring about it. But I did, because of Bullock."
The Net,5.9,50727965,75,"The Net is an efficient, workmanlike thriller that, at its best, does a canny job of exploiting the more fanciful edges of computer-age dread."
The Net,5.9,50727965,75,The Net is a scary film that could have been terrifying but for something slightly earnest and plodding in director Irwin Winkler's attack.
The Net,5.9,50727965,75,"It's exciting and satisfying, even if the chief villain isn't terribly original and the chase scenes are overlong. Bullock is plucky and believable as an average person who must marshal her strength and smarts to get her life back."
The Net,5.9,50727965,75,"This paranoid fantasy is so resonant that it makes The Net an enjoyably creepy thriller, even though Irwin Winkler belongs to the nothing-is-too-obvious school of directing."
The Net,5.9,50727965,70,"The Net starts off strong but finishes weak, and if not for the presence of actress Sandra Bullock, who graces nearly every scene, this movie might have been a snoozer."
The Net,5.9,50727965,63,"A thoroughly conventional exercise in pop paranoia with trendy appurtenances, The Net has little to offer outside of Bullock's moderately appealing presence."
The Net,5.9,50727965,63,The Net entertains but is unlikely to hang around on the cerebral hard disk for too long.
The Net,5.9,50727965,63,"Riddled with more coincidences and implausibilities than Hitchcock permitted himself in his entire career, The Net still gets by as a reasonably suspenseful, very au courant thriller."
The Net,5.9,50727965,60,"Irwin Winkler's The Net, which should have worked a lot better than it does, is a glossy, intricately plotted, mostly implausible suspense movie about a woman on the run."
The Net,5.9,50727965,60,"That anyone manages to care remotely about what's going on despite all this is a tribute to Bullock's appeal. She remains a disarmingly winning performer, though here she's saddled with some clunky, cliched bits of behavior."
The Net,5.9,50727965,60,Despite Angela's skills - and Bullock's charms - director Irwin Winkler's film is so pedestrian that his movie has all the thrills of a school crossing.
The Net,5.9,50727965,50,"This summer Bullock is in the driver's seat of The Net, a sort of chase movie on the information highway from veteran producer-turned-director Irwin Winkler, and not only is the film a comedown, it's a far less flattering showcase for her talents as well."
The Net,5.9,50727965,50,"The movie's suspense derives from figuring out how wide the evil net has been cast. But in terms of suspense, this Net is full of holes."
The Net,5.9,50727965,50,"The problem is that producer-turned-director Irwin Winkler (Night and the City, Guilty by Suspicion) simply has no idea what he's doing. I take that back. He knows what a producer ought to know: how to latch onto a hot topic and a hot star. Winkler also appears to have picked up enough from the directors he has worked with to give his film a certain second-hand slickness."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,88,"The Crow imbues its comic brutalism with emotion and satire. Too raw and pulpy, it probably shouldn't be regarded as a memorial to Brandon Lee. But as an obsessive rock 'n' roll comic book movie shocker of loony intensity, it stands, or flies, by itself."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,88,"It is a stunning work of visual style - the best version of a comic book universe I've seen - and Brandon Lee clearly demonstrates in it that he might have become an action star, had he lived."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,88,"If he had to die so soon, this movie is the best and most appropriate sendoff Lee could have hoped for."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,80,"Style over content, sure, but what style."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,80,"A seamless, pulsating, dazzlingly visual revenge fantasy that stands as one of the most effective live-actioners ever derived from a comic strip."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,75,"The Crow, the death-haunted, mega-violent, pulpy, vigorous final film of Brandon Lee, may not qualify as much of a monument to a lost life -- what film could? -- but it's a hell of a movie."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,75,"If the arrival of The Crow - a visually dazzling and hyperkinetic action movie - is an occasion to mourn the loss of Lee, it is also ample reason to celebrate the protean gifts of its director, Alex Proyas."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,75,The vision of director Alex Proyas lifts this film above its sad history.
The Crow,7.6,50693162,70,"It is a dark, lurid revenge fantasy and not the breakthrough, star-making movie some people have claimed. But it is a genre film of a high order, stylish and smooth."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,67,"Brandon Lee's swan song is a kinetic, pounding, adrenalized feast for the senses, if not the psyche. Bursting with startling images, eclectic staging, and gorgeous neo-gothic set design."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,60,"Lee has phenomenal presence, and his movements are so balletically powerful that his rampages seem like waking nightmares. Lee keeps you watching The Crow when you'd rather look away."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,60,The bottom line is that The Crow is a somewhat-better-than-average exploitation flick that has received an extra shot of hype from the untimely and dramatic demise of its star performer.
The Crow,7.6,50693162,58,"Lee's performance is by far the best thing about The Crow. Unfortunately, he's just good enough to make you wish that the movie had had a whisper of storytelling invention to go along with its showy visual design."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,50,"It succeeds in bringing O'Barr's comic-book vision to life, but there's little else going on behind the graphic razzle-dazzle and the moody, ominous soundtrack."
Resident Evil: Extinction,6.3,50648679,70,"This is wall-to-wall mayhem that dashes from one stylish, splattery, nonsensical set-piece to the next, while the star attacks her silly role with the carnivorous brio of an ocelot clawing a side of ham."
Resident Evil: Extinction,6.3,50648679,63,"Equal parts ""Mad Max"" and ""Day of the Dead,"" this third and supposedly final entry in the Resident Evil franchise is no less derivative than its predecessors but moves along at a brisk clip."
Resident Evil: Extinction,6.3,50648679,60,"Unfortunately, the new pic never really achieves maximum velocity as a full-throttle action-adventure opus, despite game efforts by returning star Milla Jovovich, still a lithe and lethal dynamo when it comes to butt-kicking, zombie-slicing derring-do."
Resident Evil: Extinction,6.3,50648679,60,"While I could probably spend an entire weekend watching Milla twirl her kukris, it's obvious from the rather lazy pacing that Anderson is growing increasingly self-indulgent with his creation."
Resident Evil: Extinction,6.3,50648679,60,"The actress, wielding a pair of swords like a chef from Benihana, remains a striking action heroine, though she's more convincing visually -- those taut thighs are weapons unto themselves -- than vocally."
Resident Evil: Extinction,6.3,50648679,42,The title gives one hope.
Resident Evil: Extinction,6.3,50648679,42,How about Resident Evil: Game Over?
Resident Evil: Extinction,6.3,50648679,40,"Almost all of it has to do with watching the occasionally nude Jovovich look absolutely smashing in duster and sidearms, but sometimes, let's face it, that's not enough."
Resident Evil: Extinction,6.3,50648679,40,"Better than the silly second instalment and boasting an effectively creepy empty world setting, it’s nevertheless scuppered by a lack of coherence."
Resident Evil: Extinction,6.3,50648679,38,"If it weren't for retro-gartered Milla Jovovich, I don't know why anyone would want to survive the virus that is turning humans into zombies and destroying the Earth in Resident Evil: Extinction."
Resident Evil: Extinction,6.3,50648679,38,This version 3.0 needs an upgrade.
Resident Evil: Extinction,6.3,50648679,12,"Shoot ’em up, run ’em over, blast ’em with flame-throwers, who cares? These creatures are only there to go splat."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,75,"Mighty Joe Young is not meek and harmless; it's a full-blooded action picture, all right, but with a certain warmth and humor instead of a scorched-earth approach. You feel good at the end, instead of merely relieved."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,75,"Joe is a masterpiece of special effects wizardry, looking more real than any giant primate ever to walk across the silver screen. By combining animatronics, computer-generated images, and a man in a costume, Mighty Joe Young creates a compelling illusion."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,75,Mighty Joe Young is a mighty fun movie. The trick? They didn't try to out-monster those bloated King Kong and Godzilla franchises. But it's still a hoot of an adventure about an overgrown ape having trouble adjusting to life in California.
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,75,"Mighty Joe Young is wholesome, well-crafted family fare like Hollywood used to make."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,75,"Mighty Joe Young may be the season's most appealing family bet. Certainly, it has an appealing cast."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,70,"It's all a little silly, and silly in a way that's less fun than the original—due in part to an obvious subplot involving a poacher played by a hammy Peter Firth—but its kid-friendly B-movie charm and the peerless Mr. Young make it worthwhile, undemanding entertainment."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,70,"Neat as Joe looks, you do wish that someone had bothered to give him a personality."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,67,"Mighty Joe Young, directed by Ron Underwood from a screenplay by Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner, is saddled with dialogue so wooden that Mr. Paxton and Ms. Theron almost seem animatronic themselves. Little children won't notice. In Joe, they can identify with the biggest, cuddliest simian toy a 6-year-old could ever hope to own."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,60,"Mighty Joe Young is a mighty big movie about a mighty big gorilla. And a lot of it is mighty bad -- unless you're a devotee of high tech and low camp, elephantine effects and mouse-sized stories, politically correct nostalgia and/or Charlize Theron and Bill Paxton in jungle outfits."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,50,"Joe himself is an amazing creation, less personable, to be sure, than the original lovelorn King Kong, but a far more fully realized character than any of the flesh and blood humans by whom he's surrounded."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,50,"Paxton, as always, is thoroughly engaging, and Theron is coming into her own as an actress, but the bottom line here is that the film lacks the original's goofy good humor. Less effects and more humanity are in order before this remake can even get within spitting distance of the original."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,50,"This rather basic story is really just a place to hang the action scenes, which should have been the movie's glory. But those scenes turn out to be the worst things about Mighty Joe Young, in which the action is edited, MTV-style, for maximum incoherence."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,50,"Those under 10 may love Joe, but adults will find him less appealing. Theron almost saves the day, until she flounders under the weight of poor dialogue, dull direction and a role that seems to value her make-up over her acting."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,83,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit though, gets the international-espionage ingredients almost exactly right."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,80,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is half silliness, half swagger, but Branagh's arms-akimbo impudence as a director makes it work. He takes it all seriously, but with a wink."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,75,"The movie finds its feet, and unrolls as a pretty suspenseful, largely engaging, and hardly ever too-over-the-top spy thriller."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,75,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit provides the best motion picture adventure for the title character since his introduction in ""The Hunt for Red October."""
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,75,"Even with its thrifty set pieces and smaller ambitions, this attempt to reboot the series based on Tom Clancy characters does the most important thing right: It almost always feels like a Jack Ryan movie."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,75,"In keeping his actors on his sober-yet-buoyant plane, Kenneth Branagh presents a convincing romance that doesn't stall the film's brisk clip."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,75,"Soundly structured, smart and fast, with a plausible central scenario, several gripping moments and well-wrought dialogue."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,70,A reboot of an A-level spy series seems too pretty-good to be true. Shadow Recruit occupies this weekend’s movie screens as familiarly and reassuringly as a Walther PPK fits in the hand of James Bond.
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,70,"A competently made, moderately diverting variation on a genre standard."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,70,"Crisp, efficient and appreciably modest in scale...this conspicuous attempt to breathe new life into a long-dormant action franchise gets at least a few things right, chiefly the shrewd casting of Chris Pine."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,70,"Branagh did a nice job of directing ""Thor,"" but all he can do here is try to energize the recycled pulp of the script."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,67,"Too much of the action in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit takes place on laptops, thumb drives, and video monitors."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,63,"Slick, loud, assured, overplotted (way overplotted), fairly diverting, and pretty much empty."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,63,"Though directed with great precision by Branagh, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is saddled with a boilerplate script."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,63,Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit has no personality of its own. It's a product constructed out of spare parts and assembled with computerized precision. It's hard to care when Jack turns operational and becomes a CIA robocop. The movie feels untouched by human hands.
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,63,"Pine, who has been so good and so instrumental in J.J. Abrams’ Star Trek series as Captain Kirk, turns out to be a decent Ryan."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,63,"Branagh & Co. keep up appearances with a thriller that works mainly because all of its parts — locations, fights and plot twists — are well worn from all the thrillers they’ve been in before."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,63,The film is slow in getting started and once it's underway it's only intermittently involving. It's also occasionally far-fetched.
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,63,"A solid outing for a re-Bourne hero that could, with a few key tweaks, generate another round of vehicles for the Clancy cash cow."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,60,"In stripping Jack Ryan back to basics it’s lost some sophistication, but reinvigorated an action hero who’s unlike any other on offer and who absolutely earns his second — or rather fourth — shot."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,60,"The movie itself isn’t dull. It’s moderately stylish, moderately suspenseful, fun in patches. It hits its marks. But the setup lacks urgency."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,60,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is a well-made movie, well-acted (Costner and Branagh seem to be having an especially good time) and a pleasant diversion. They’ll probably make several more. But it doesn’t exactly put the “thrill” in action thriller."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,60,"Branagh, taking advantage of his experience helming 2011’s “Thor,” shows an allegiance to the genre he’s working in; both as director as co-star, he pours on the menace."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,60,"The plot’s a bit complex for what amounts to a lot of running around — the movie can’t help but evoke the Bourne series along with a high-gloss hint of Skyfall, not wholly unpleasantly."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,60,"By my rough calculation, the real Jack Ryan should be approximately 103. Preposterous but moderately engaging, Jack Ryan has outlived his welcome, and there’s no end in sight."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,50,"There is no shaking the feeling that Branagh and his cast are a kind of an espionage film B team, capable of mild diversion but nothing more."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,50,"Branagh, who proved his action bona fides with “Thor,” does an inarguably competent job of choreographing a modestly intelligent espionage thriller, even if it’s impossible to identify anything new he’s bringing to an already groaning table."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,50,The movie eventually evokes the sense that Branagh is better at directing in front of the camera than from behind it; its best moments are typically the ones that feature Branagh’s Viktor Cherevin on-screen.
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,50,"There’s promising raw material here, particularly in the early scenes. But the film’s second half seems determined to snuff out the promise of its first, making it hard to wish for this incarnation of the character, or any, to have more big-screen adventures."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,50,An average franchise re-launch.
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,50,"Efficient, if ultimately rote, political thriller."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,50,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit refashions the character (this time played by Chris Pine) into a man of immediate action, and in doing so drains him of anything that made him a relatable human being."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,42,"This is moviemaking in a modular mode, an inspiration-free action adventure — with cheesy cinematography — that fills its modest running time by fitting together familiar elements into something reliably, even insistently, not new."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,40,"The appeal of the Jack Ryan character, at least on the page, was that he was always the smartest guy in the room. In Shadow Recruit, that doesn’t seem to be much of an accomplishment, because the movie around him is so dumb."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,38,"Branagh might as well have opened a can and dumped it on a plate, the ridges of a factory-line production still perfectly hatched on a gelatinous cylinder of crud."
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,75,Marks Chan's full arrival as an actor. Take away the violence - - and there's plenty of it for those who crave Chan's physical pyrotechnics -- and he's still an immense pleasure to watch onscreen.
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,63,The jokes are as fresh as rotten eggs and the direction stoops to the occasion.
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,60,Chan is still able to project the boyishness and insecurity of the new kid on the block. But even those aren't enough to make Tuxedo a black-tie affair.
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,58,"Chan needs a foil, and Hewitt, while perky, doesn't project nearly enough comedy weight; she's too slight and tailored for his style."
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,50,"A breakthrough for karate comedy king Chan, but not necessarily the kind we've all been waiting and hoping for. It's an ultra-digitized DreamWorks show crammed with elaborate special effects, the kind that physical-stunt specialist Chan has always avoided."
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,50,"You know you're in trouble when 50% of the running length is devoted to plot exposition, and the movie still doesn't make any sense."
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,50,It's a fun gimmick -- the sartorial equivalent of those red shoes in the fairy tale that made an ordinary girl dance like Terpsichore -- if not an altogether fun movie.
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,50,This ill-fitting Tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack.
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,42,"Feather-light and proudly goofy, this Jackie Chan action comedy appears to be aimed squarely at under-12s."
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,42,"May have been tailored just for Mr. Chan, but it still feels like off-the-rack garb. And by now, Mr. Chan deserves much better than a hand-me-down suit that smells like a rental."
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,40,"This bad idea is then underlined by pallid direction from tyro helmer and TV ad vet Kevin Donovan, a virtually incomprehensible plot line and a less-than-satisfying co-starring turn from Jennifer Love Hewitt."
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,40,Jackie Chan is thoroughly wasted in a bad suit and a witless comedy.
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,40,"The movie is silly beyond comprehension, and even if it weren't silly, it would still be beyond comprehension."
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,40,"The material in this spy spoof is, pardon the pun, awfully frayed."
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,38,"The only possible surprise in The Tuxedo would be an extended demonstration of what was once Chan's trademark, the daffily choreographed kineticism forbidden of late by either his own age or the scruples of story editors."
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,38,"A frenetic, busy, expensive machine that looks good but runs on autopilot."
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,30,This movie is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States.
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,30,"The film is ultimately more labored than inspired. A cameo by James Brown is amusing, but it can't keep The Tuxedo from earning the distinction of being Chan's worst Hollywood film to date."
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,30,"It's a comic-book idea that might have been fun. But it's beyond the reach of first-time feature director Kevin Donovan, who squanders his main asset, Jackie Chan, and fumbles the vital action sequences."
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,30,"Who writes this stuff, anyway? Does this not sound like utter gibberish? Surely, this film did not actually get made, did it? Yes, it did. I have seen it. But you, oh, fortunate one, don't have to. Consider yourself lucky."
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,25,"Jackie Chan finally has met his match, an opponent so deadly that none of his considerable talent or charm can fight it -- a bad movie"
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,25,Inept script delivers a series of juvenile gags.
The Tuxedo,5.4,50547998,25,"Most indicative of The Tuxedo's mediocrity, however, is the absence of the always entertaining action outtakes that traditionally roll under the end credits of Chan films; here it's all dialogue flubs barely fit for Dick Clark."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,70,"I was at least able to follow the plot (which is not to say it wasn't as ludicrous as any Bond film -- just that I could follow it). But most of all this movie has camp value -- it's fun to sit there and make fun of every last detail, and that redeems it quite a bit."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,70,"Hard as it is to justify Bond films on intellectual grounds, there's something invigorating -- and strangely reassuring -- about this sort of picture. It is comforting to feel that should a psychopath threaten the stability of the world, our hero will be ready to wipe the grin off his face and shove him into San Francisco Bay."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,67,"Beyond Walken and Jones’ considerable contributions, A View to a Kill also contains a robust assortment of action sequences."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,63,"Even though Moore sleepwalks his way through the part, making it apparent that he should have departed two films ago, and Tanya Roberts can't act to save her life (although she certainly can scream), we're back to a more conventional, straightforward Bond than the convoluted mess of the previous movie."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,60,"Christopher Walken sleepwalks his way through playing smarmy Nazi geneticist Zorin, where you would think he would have a ball hamming it up as a Bond villain. Indeed, it is a rare moment when Grace Jones makes the biggest impression as an Amazonian (naturally) henchman called May Day."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,50,"This jokey tone couldn’t be more different from the relative self-seriousness of helmer John Glen’s first 007 directing effort, For Your Eyes Only, and frankly, I yearn for more of that class."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,50,"With Sean Connery as Agent 007, James Bond was a human-scale figure, an exceedingly cool guy to be sure, but a guy nonetheless. With Roger Moore as Bond, we are simply watching a lightweight actor stroll through a role."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,50,"A View to a Kill plods along dutifully, observing the rules of the series with dull consistency."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,50,"As lavishly escapist as they are, the latest James Bond films have become strenuous to watch, now that the business of maintaining Bond's casual savoir-faire looks like such a monumental chore."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,40,"As for Bond’s glib wit, which has been running down lately, the screenwriters haven’t solved that problem. Some of his double entendres are older than Moore and one of them had to be used twice."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,40,"Directed by John Glen (For Your Eyes Only), this movie has all the standard Bond components--beautiful women, picturesque locales, thrilling chases--but the time-tested formula is more than a little threadbare here. Moreover, Walken doesn't have the lines, the strength, the presence, or the dastardliness required to be a top-notch Bond adversary."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,40,"Just follows the numbers, plodding from one unimaginative set piece to the next. Even the tony cast of villains—Christopher Walken, Patrick Bauchau, and Grace Jones—can't add any flavor to the grindingly predictable proceedings."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,40,"What's good? A mesmeric, bottle-blond Christopher Walken as Max Zorin, hellbent on global domination as a product of Nazi experiments, Grace Jones' zowie star at his henchman, and Duran Duran's title song. Otherwise, I'm out."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,40,"If there is such a thing as a pulse in movies, there are sections of this one where a defibrillator would come in handy. This is not due to a lack of action scenes but those included are strung together with long, slow stretches."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,38,"There is some magnificent stunt work, which only underscores how inadequate Moore has become. Moore isn't just long in the tooth -- he's got tusks, and what looks like an eye job has given him the pie-eyed blankness of a zombie. He's not believable anymore in the action sequences, even less so in the romantic scenes."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,38,"Bond struck camp long ago, so it would seem pointless to complain about the dilution of Fleming's cruel stud into a smirking dinner-jacket with a crude line in double entendres. But the problem here is that the elements which act as consolation in late Bondage are missing."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,80,"Sound silly? It is. Very. But it's also highly enjoyable, incredibly slick and a damn sight more entertaining than numerous other bombastic actioners. Bogosian makes for a splendidly deranged villain."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,80,This is Seagal's best movie since Out for Justice.
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,75,"I mention all of these tiny logical quibbles because I was amused by them. I was also amused by the film. It isn't as good as the original ""Under Siege,"" but it moves quickly, has great stunts and special effects, and is a lot of fun."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,75,"Seagal is a solid, whispering presence, but he is particularly well served by a special-effects team that provides him with one exciting visual adventure after another. Along with ""Species,"" this is a perfect summer action film experience."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,75,A solidly enjoyable formula thriller.
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,75,"This sequel is much better than the original ""Under Siege""...The real coup here is the discovery that when you eliminate dialogue, and thus eliminate Seagal's efforts to act in that rather high voice of his, the movie takes on a surprising gravity. When Seagal doesn't talk, he verges on the dignified. It's kind of scary."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,75,"Under Siege 2 isn't going to convince anyone that Seagal is Brando, though he often sounds a bit like him. But, taken strictly as an action sequel, the film is a lively show. It's a formula follow-up with formula dialogue and formula action but the director, Geoff Murphy, does extremely well within the sequel's narrow limits."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,70,It's fists and feet that do the talking in Under Siege 2 and they prove eloquent enough.
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,70,"Bogosian provides some much-needed comic relief to the slogging tale. He turns in solid work, as does Everett McGill as his head strongman, but they and others are saddled with pedestrian dialogue and motivation."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,63,"We'll bet you our measly paycheck that UNDER SIEGE 3 is set on an airplane -- although, given the precipitous downward trajectory of Seagal's career, a moped or a pair of in-line skates isn't out of the question."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,50,"Although Under Siege 2 isn't credible for a single moment, its director, Geoff Murphy, has done a smoothly efficient job of coordinating the action sequences."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,50,"Murphy, who started directing movies in his native Australia, does a good job of locomoting Under Siege 2 at a lively, muscular clip."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,50,"I have come to the conclusion that it's impossible for a Steven Segal movie to be anything better than mediocre, and this particular travesty may be his worst yet. The title Under Siege is supposed to represent the situation faced by Segal's character, but it's equally appropriate in describing the experience of the poor viewer who sits through this film."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,50,It is so bad and illogical that even devoted loyalists should find their faith tested. The subtitle Dark Territory doesn't even begin to describe how inchoate and blemished this storytelling is.
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,70,"If there's one thing going for Last Action Hero, it's the construction of it all. Even if this intermixing of kid fantasy and adult shoot'em-up, Hollywood insider jokes and cheap Arnold puns, doesn't completely bowl you over, it's clever and intriguing."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,63,"For all of its sensational stunts and flashes of wit, however, Last Action Hero plays more like a bright idea than like a movie that was thought through. It doesn't evoke the mystery of the barrier between audience and screen the way Woody Allen did, and a lot of the time it simply seems to be standing around commenting on itself."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,63,"Last Action Hero is something of a mess, but a frequently enjoyable one. It tries to be too many things to too many different kinds of audiences, the result being that it will probably confuse, and perhaps even alienate, the hard-core action fans."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,63,"The movie isn't mindless; it just has a mind that's a bit junky and muddled. And to their credit, Arnold and his collaborators haven't played it safe. Last Action Hero is a stretch. Unfortunately, it's a stretch that proves the star wasn't that elastic to begin with."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,60,"The performances of both Schwarzenegger and O'Brien are labored, the pacing uneven, and maybe only half the gags work, but there's a certain amount of creative energy and audacity mixed in with all the confusion."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,60,"This is an attempt to be both a high-octane actionfest and a satire on such films, the result of which is the weirdest concoction: the metaphysical blockbuster. No wonder it tanked."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,60,"The film tries so very hard to be The Movie of Summer '93 that it almost makes you sick for what could have been, what should have been, and, in the end, what it is: soulless sound and fury -- action in a vacuum."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,60,"Last Action Hero is sporadically entertaining, but it could have been a whole lot more. Trimmed down and better edited, this film might have been a top-notch satire. As it is, however, it gets caught someplace in between action and comedy, and never really comes across as a solid example of either."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,50,"Hero claims to be a gentle, playful parody of the action/adventure genre, but comes off as a mercenary attempt to cash in on summer movie-going habits."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,50,"Last Action Hero makes such a strenuous show of winking at the audience (and itself) that it seems to be celebrating nothing so much as its own awfulness. In a sense, the movie's incipient commercial failure completes it aesthetically."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,75,"Thankfully, much of Red Tails is spent in the skies, where fighter planes swoop and zoom in thrilling dogfights with incendiary direct hits. Executive producer George Lucas apparently gave Hemingway the keys to his CGI kingdom, creating marvelously designed in-flight action and a sappy, snappy salute to the Tuskegee Airmen."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,75,"Overreaching fits of melodrama, occasionally stilted dialogue, and performances by Gooding Jr. and Howard that are mostly a series of serious faces can't keep the shiny Red Tails from taking flight."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,75,"A well-acted, well-directed (by TV veteran Anthony Hemingway) popcorn movie with great aerial battles and solid dramatic scenes that hold your attention for two good hours."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,70,"Perhaps the movie's most surprising feat? Somehow, the darned thing mostly works, probably because its heart is in the right place."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,67,"Kudos to the makers Red Tails for paying homage to a remarkable group of men and their genuinely heroic deeds, and a hat-tip as well for the idea that the best way to tell the story was the old-fashioned way.  But would that the film's old-school aura felt knowingly retro rather than dutifully rote."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,67,"As long as it stays in the air, Red Tails is a compelling sky-war pageant of a movie. On the ground, it's a far shakier experience: dutiful and prosaic, with thinly scripted episodes that don't add up to a satisfying story."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,63,"Sadly, the result is a disappointment. Sure, the aerial battles are technically adept and occasionally exhilarating, but it's almost painful to sit through some of the ""drama"" that occurs on the ground."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,63,"David Oyelowo stands out as the daredevil Joe ""Lightning"" Little, the unit's best flier. With his bravery and bravado, he's the film's most complex character."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,63,"There isn't a real, flesh-and-blood figure in the bunch. Everything about Red Tails - the breaking down of racial barriers, the military achievements, the courage and sacrifice - is diminished in the process."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,63,Red Tails is entertaining. Audiences are likely to enjoy it. The scenes of aerial combat are skillfully done and exciting.
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,60,"Such a story is made to be colored in jumbo crayon, and at first you might long for a more nuanced approach, but this film was produced in the 1940's serial style that's made Lucas Films enormous."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,60,"In the end Red Tails is mostly about the coolness of flying. Its heart is in the clouds, instead of with the men at the controls."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,58,"When a great movie subject results in a middling movie, the loss is double."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,50,You leave Red Tails thinking of what might have been instead of what is – a missed opportunity.
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,50,"Red Tails is both a stirring and simplistic tribute to the men that not only shattered the U.S. Army Air Corps' racial barrier but also saved the lives of many a white, B-17 crew member, all while downing countless numbers of Hitler's formidable, jet-propelled Luftwaffe."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,50,"Where Spielberg has made WWII a venue for his sanctimonious side, a platform to convince viewers that war is indeed hell, Lucas is still in a state of pre-adolescent fascination with the conflict."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,50,"The movie is so desperate to be palatable, to appeal to everybody that it doesn't taste like anything."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,50,"Every character here is so squeaky-clean, and the prejudice as depicted is so toothless and easily overcome, that the film feels like a gingerly fantasy version of what, in real life, was an exceptional example of resilient trail-blazing."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,50,"Red Tails squanders a great subject, reducing the real-life struggles and fierce heroics of the Tuskegee Airmen to rickety cliche."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,42,"The aerial sequences look an awful lot like X-wing-versus-TIE-fighter battles and the effects have the same not-quite-solid feel of the Star Wars prequels. When the heroes crash, they go up in blazes of digital glory that seem just as artificial as the plotting that brought them to their fates."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,40,"For all the occasional grace of its high-flying derring-do, Red Tails barely feels like a movie. It's an uncertain hodgepodge of impulses and desires that never coheres enough to even crash and burn."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,40,To say that this live-action comic book lives up to Mr. Lucas's description is not a wholehearted endorsement. Are teenage boys as naïve today as they were 60 or more years ago? And much of the dialogue is groaningly clunky. But so it was back then.
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,40,"One could argue that the target audience - black teenagers, Mr. Lucas has said - might be most receptive to a film that conveys history through contemporary entertainment. But this isn't contemporary entertainment, it's antiquated kitsch reprocessed by the producer's nostalgia for the movies of his boyhood. The story has been stripped of historical context - don't black teenagers and everyone else deserve hard facts? - and internal logic."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,40,"Alas, it was George Lucas who became captivated by the Tuskegee Airmen and has, after many years as devoted producer, managed to turn their story into a feature film that falls much closer to the goofy ""Hogan's Heroes"" in the spectrum of World War II-focused productions than ""Saving Private Ryan."""
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,40,"Apart from the occasional thrill provided by CG-enhanced aerial dogfights, this stuffy history lesson about the groundbreaking African-American fighter pilot division never quite takes off, weighed down by wooden characters and leaden screenwriting."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,40,"George Lucas produced this candy-coated, fictionalized drama, and while its cast is first-rate and its flying sequences sharp, the movie is as glazed and wide-eyed as a 70-year-old comic book."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,40,"George Lucas served as executive producer for this effects-heavy action film about the Tuskegee Airmen, and it feels as synthetic and dull as ""The Phantom Menace."""
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,40,So narratively old-fashioned it creaks.
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,38,"Virtue aside, however, Red Tails is a lousy film. Not wincingly bad, mind you, just mediocre."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,38,"The war-movie cliches are as abundant as the antiaircraft fire, and the dialogue as wooden as a balsa glider. The leading characters are issued one personality trait apiece, and some don't even get that. Cuba Gooding Jr., for example, plays Maj. Emanuelle Stance as a man who smokes a pipe."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,30,"Remember that scene from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" when a swastika-stamped Nazi crate explodes for no good reason (beyond the fact that the Ark hates Nazis)? Red Tails is like that, only less awesome, and considerably longer."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,25,What's missing is any hint of realism. There's no grit to it anywhere.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,88,"A dizzying lowlife saga that’s fast, smart, wicked, sort of ambitious and blazingly ironic. It’s as unpredictable as a Lindsay Lohan drive to the grocery store, as overstuffed as the pictures on Anthony Weiner’s Twitter feed and as hilarious as me on the bench press."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,75,"In telling a true story about hapless thugs who are the embodiment of Michael Bay fans, the director has made the most fiendishly enjoyable movie of his career."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,75,It's funny as hell at times with a twisted sense of humor that one typically expects from the likes of the Coen Brothers and Quentin Tarantino.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,75,"This is easily Bay’s best movie, the work of a filmmaker with a cracked sense of humor that he is able to share with the audience."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,75,"Even though Pain & Gain does indeed mine laughs from some very violent acts, there is nothing in this movie that glamorizes those three meatheads. Kudos to Bay and his screenwriters for making sure we’re laughing at them, not with them."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,75,"With Pain & Gain, his surprising true-crime comedy, Bay has finally decided to lighten up a bit."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,70,Pain & Gain gives you a rush while at the same time making you queasy about how you’re getting off.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,70,Michael Bay sends a clear message to those of us who've been making fun of him: He's been in on the joke the whole time.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,70,"It's like a giant sculpture that is so strange and off-putting, it's instantly, intriguingly post-modern. Swept up in the film's pile-driving self-assurance, even Bay-haters may absorb the pain to enjoy the gain."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,63,"As ambitious and vibrant as it is ugly and scattershot, Pain & Gain is the most charming Michael Bay movie in a long while."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,63,An outrageous based-on-real-life tale that's perfectly suited to director Michael Bay's insanely overblown stylistic and thematic temperament.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,63,"It’s just too much — too much graphic violence, too many plot wrinkles, too much stupidity, too many supporting players to track...For a movie as physically fit as this one wants to be, Pain & Gain is carrying way too much extra weight."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,The movie needed some more detachment – and brevity – but Wahlberg shows once again he has the comedy chops.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,"The ever-present air of madcap, goofball insanity carries it through. A seriously guilty pleasure."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,"Michael Bay goes back to a Bad Boys budget and a big boys’ rating, for a true-life crime story that’s inconsistent and frenetic, but also funny and wilfully outrageous."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,"Like all of Bay’s work, it’s over-the-top, brash and exhausting to watch. But like the lifestyle its characters aspire to, there’s an allure too."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,Wahlberg and Johnson are the saving graces of an in-your-face movie.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,It all leaves you pondering whether you have just seen a monumentally stupid movie or a brilliant movie about the nature and consequences of stupidity.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"A day and half after walking out with a sensation, primarily, of physical relief—at two hours and nine minutes, Pain & Gain makes for a long, loud, relentlessly assaultive sit—I find that my thumb is wavering at half-mast. I’m still not sure whether to mildly like or mildly hate this movie."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,Nobody in it seems to possess a nervous system.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,The script’s occasional gestures toward making this an allegory of the failed American dream are extremely unconvincing in the context of a movie that revels in the excesses of macho culture while laughing at the hapless and stupid who can’t get it right.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"That sense of extreme, excess, over-the-top everything is there from start to finish. And isn't that what Bay fans count on even at cut-rate prices?"
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"A badly constructed, blood-spattered caper that comes unglued early on."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"Yep, it's all fun and games until someone gets brutalized repeatedly. Before you can avert your eyes, it's Katie, bar the door and break out the chain saws."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,Bay blankets the film in a tone of smug self-awareness that obscures everything but its bald hypocrisy.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"There’s a certain kinetic charm to the first half of the movie, a freewheeling silliness to these outsized characters that makes you curious to see just how wrong things will go. But as the weightlifters’ plot spirals out of control, so does the movie’s."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"Yes, the canon invoked for this film is that of the Three Stooges, but it’s still not as magnificently berserk as they can be. Set your expectations carefully for this one."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"Bay can be a master of exuberant chaos, but here the violence mostly lands with a sickening thud, which is fitting, one supposes, but also ultimately numbing."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"The movie's best performance — and worst defamation — belongs to Tony Shalhoub, playing the first victim as a conniving, egotistical jerk who deserves to be kidnapped, maimed and ruined financially."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,42,"This is a tragedy, not a comedy."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,40,"When the story runs off the rails and crashes headfirst into a too-perfect ending, it's because Bay was led astray by the same things that got the Sun Gym Gang into this mess in the first place: superficiality, ambition, and the belief that reality just isn't good enough."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,40,"It's Bay World. And after an hour of Pain & Gain, it felt more like ""Pain & Pain."""
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,38,Pain & Gain fails at being an entertaining and ridiculously fun Michael Bay movie and curdles into something much more tone deaf and obnoxious.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,33,"The whole thing is played for laughs that almost never come. To be sure, the film has its moments, but they’re few and far between."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,25,"Bay seems to have been gunning for something along the lines of ""Blood Simple"" or ""A Simple Plan,"" but Pain & Gain is just plain simple."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,25,"Pain & Gain, a jokey but fatally tone-deaf true-crime caper, plays like “Fargo” for idiots."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,25,"Any pretensions of satire, moral ambiguity, or social commentary get lost in a hurricane of empty, mindless spectacle."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,25,"It would be kind to call this satire; what it comes off as is a pummeling, testosterone-fueled sensory assault that the film then makes minor variations on for two very long hours."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,20,The story is told in a hammer-on-anvil manner that evinces no gift for social satire or sharp cultural insight.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,20,"In between scenes of the muscleheads torturing their victim, Bay indulges his taste for treating women as sluts and grisly brutality as a nifty excuse for a cheap laugh. Pain and Gain is personal all right. You leave these characters with the distinct impression that they're Bay's kind of people."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,12,"Michael Bay's absurdist comedy is all pain, no gain and an utter monstrosity. It may be the most unpleasant movie I've ever seen, and I'm not forgetting ""Freaks,"" which Pain & Gain resembles, come to think of it."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,75,I guess you have to be in the mood for a goofball picture like this. I guess I was.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,75,I'm pleased to report the new Land of the Lost movie keenly understands that what was once scary is now ridiculous.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,70,"Land of the Lost is an enjoyable regression to Saturday mornings gone by, as junky and sweet as a strawberry Pop-Tart."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,63,Scrambled space-time comedy that's as light and silly as it is erratic.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,50,"Land of the Lost has stray amusing tidbits, but overall it leaves you feeling splattered."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,50,"It ends up sagging into a pleasantly undistinguished pudding. The big news is that Matt Lauer, playing himself, can act. A little. Hardly at all, really. But he’s a jolly good sport, and quite handy with a fire extinguisher."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,50,It's hard to know just who the intended audience is: The movie is too surreal and bawdy for young kids and too silly for anyone older than 25.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,50,Not exactly a hundred million dollars' worth of classic comedy.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,50,"It's cheap-looking (dinosaurs and other beasts here look like CGI loaners from Spielberg), deeply mediocre and predictable."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,50,The result is eight times as strange and exponentially more potty-mouthed than the original series.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,50,"If director Brad Silberling had taken this cast to their natural extremes, he might have delivered a raucously funny sci-fi comedy -- think ""Anchorman"" meets ""Jurassic Park."" Instead, Land of the Lost is an utter misfire -- not bad enough to hate, not good enough to remember."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,40,"Ferrell's latest excursion into delusions of manhood is director Brad Silberling's Land of the Lost, an action comedy with the sloppy construction and saving grace notes of the star's other movies."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,40,"The only marginally interesting, if unsurprising, thing about the pricey movie spinoff of the junky children's television show Land of the Lost is that a lot of money has been spent on yet another cultural throwaway."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,40,Land of the Lost isn't a terrible movie. It's merely a perplexing one: Who is this thing for?
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,40,"Like its characters, the film keeps getting lost too, stumbling as it struggles to keep kids and adults from squirming in their seats."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,40,"Humdrum adaptation that should, given the ripe nature of its source material, have been much better."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,38,"A turd of T-Rex proportions, Land of the Lost makes one remember last summer's ""Speed Racer"" fondly."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,38,The whole thing feels at least three summers too stale.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,38,"Genially terrible, Lost is lazy, sloppy multiplex filler, good for a few solid giggles and not much more."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,38,"Ferrell may well shoulder the blame for Land of the Lost, even if he doesn't deserve it. He did, however, willingly participate in this coarse, sloppy big-screen version of the old Saturday-morning time-warp adventure."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,38,Will Ferrell and Danny McBride can find the dumb fun in anything. Too bad that Land of the Lost is so much less than anything.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,33,"It doesn't help that neither Ferrell nor McBride bring their best material, with McBride offering yet another variation on an angry redneck, and Ferrell falling back on Ron Burgundy-like bluster and nonsense exclamations."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,33,It's all so resolutely uninspired that even the kids in the audience may want to duck out.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,30,The result is a movie with an exceedingly narrow target audience that should test Will Ferrell's appeal among boys maybe ages 12-14 -- about the only demo likely able to endure this laborious mess.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,30,"Lame sketch comedy, an uninspired performance from Will Ferrell and an overall failure of the imagination turn Brad Silberling's Land of the Lost into a lethargic meander through a wilderness of misfiring gags."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,30,Summertime junk food.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,25,"There is also a sense that the filmmakers weren't quite certain if they wanted to make a fun, kid-friendly adventure or a bawdy adult-skewed comedy. Walking the tightrope doesn't work."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,25,Land of the Lost is one of those films so caught up in its concept it has forgotten its audience.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,20,"It's all noise and flash and chaos, but it lacks virtually everything that made the original television series so memorable."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,20,"This lumbering, ha-ha-look-what-we-remade action-comedy is a high-concept disaster."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,12,"Will Ferrell's terminally stupid, sloppy, campy and cheesy -- and thoroughly unexciting and unfunny -- experiment in ""family entertainment."""
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,0,"This dramatically, thematically and artistically bankrupt comic fantasy cost something in the neighborhood of $100 million to make and isn't worth the celluloid it's printed on."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,90,"Deft filmmaking that allows the special effects to help, not be, the story combines with an actual script to make Volcano a smart, self-aware, and most of all fun disaster movie."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,80,"But a great sense of pace is a wonderful thing, and director Jackson and his crew (who made good use of hand-held and Steadicam shots and reportedly averaged an impressive 30 to 40 camera setups a day) move so quickly from shot to shot and location to location that viewers have a limited time to dwell on the film's predictable implausibilities."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,75,"In fact, this is one of the best pure disaster movies ever made (not that it has much competition). Congratulations to director Mick Jackson for a job well done."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,70,"Watching this film is a little bit like getting mauled and tickled at the same time. The filmmakers have given the whole shebang a hefty levity, and that's not easy to accomplish in a full-scale disaster movie."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,70,The secret of Volcano's success as a better-than-average disasterama is its nonstop pace.
Volcano,5.5,49323468,70,"A furiously paced popcorn picture whose outrageous implausibility is somewhat amusing, Volcano delivers enough spectacular action to get it off to a hot B.O. start, although like the lava in the picture, it may not flow quite as far as anticipated."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,67,"I had a pretty good time at Volcano. The reason I didn't have a better time is that the characters aren't just schlocky, they're boring."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,60,"Unfortunately, Volcano is also faithful to Hollywood's legendary lack of originality."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,60,"In Volcano, the thrills are so well wrought that they eventually lose their novelty and become numbing."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,60,"But for anyone willing to swallow a large pinch of salt there is much to enjoy in the film's numerous nail-munching, white-knuckle set-pieces variously employing firetruck ladders, subway trains and a finale so ridiculous that it just... might... work."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,60,"The fun is in the mayhem, and there's plenty of it."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,50,"A flatulent blast of superheated air from the seething bowels of Hollywood, features all the usual idiocies -- implausibility on an epic scale, bogus ""human interest"" elements, plot developments that offer all the surprises of a Bob Dole speech."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,50,"With its fake-looking technology and empty characters, Volcano eventually becomes as obvious as its what-if premise."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,50,Congratulations to director Mick Jackson and writers Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray for liberating themselves from the tedious demands of believability.
Volcano,5.5,49323468,50,"You hope against hope that the lava flowing through the city will wipe out Los Angeles and everyone in it, if only to prevent them from making more movies like this."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,50,"This disaster film has action from the get-go; but its awesome special effects hide a laughably corny plot, and for a picture about terror from the depths, its characters are ridiculously shallow."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,50,"Here, the volcanic villain behaves like a smart terrorist, taking over almost immediately and holding a collection of excellent actors (Tommy Lee Jones, Anne Heche, Don Cheadle) hostage for two hours of ""real time."""
Volcano,5.5,49323468,50,"In a few sound bites, we get the picture and the picture's motto: the smug and selfish coast is an order of disaster-flick toast waiting to burn."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,40,"While disaster yarns aren't known for subtlety, there are limits, and Volcano giddily goes beyond them."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,38,This is a surprisingly cheesy disaster epic.
Volcano,5.5,49323468,30,"Crucial to the nature of the disaster film -- and something that Irwin Allen knew so very well -- is that films of this sort depend on an emotional hook, a peg of normalcy to hang the chaos from. Volcano offers no such hook, and as a result it plays like some La Brea dinosaur risen from the tar, all effects and no heart."
Volcano,5.5,49323468,30,"Volcano is just another $100 million genre movie, and a pretty lousy one, to boot."
Cobra,5.7,49042224,70,"Cobra is a sleek, extremely violent and exciting police thriller."
Cobra,5.7,49042224,63,"Whereas Clint Eastwood simply would have squinted at Robinson,
Stallone takes a more violent approach. Maybe that's the difference between
actors--Eastwood can be droll; Stallone more often crosses the border to
primeval."
Cobra,5.7,49042224,30,"A disturbing movie from many points of view: disturbing for the violence it portrays, the ideas it represents and the large number of people who will undoubtedly go to see it and cheer on its dangerous hero."
Cobra,5.7,49042224,30,"There is not nearly enough violence. No one is eviscerated. The villains, all mumblers to a man, are not punished by having their tongues cut out. The body count is only somewhere in the high eighties - and most of these are simply gunned down with a deplorable lack of invention. Very little is done by way of eye-gouging, limb-crushing or tooth-extraction."
Cobra,5.7,49042224,30,"It's fast-paced and full of gaudy action, yet it's thoroughly unsatisfying, largely because it's so lazy: once Stallone (also the screenwriter) and director George Pan Cosmatos have sketched out the standard genre archetypes, they leave it at that, not bothering to fill in the niceties of characterization, plausibility, motivation, and suspense."
Cobra,5.7,49042224,25,"Cobra's pretentious emptiness, its dumbness, its two-faced morality make it a movie that begs to be laughed off."
Cobra,5.7,49042224,10,Every aspect of this film is reprehensible. Stallone's character is an empty hulk; the few attempts to provide us with little insights into his character are downright laughable.
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,88,Movies like this embrace goofiness with an almost sensual pleasure.
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,60,"Speed 2 is a well-above-average armrest-gripper with little in it to upset the children excepting, perhaps, Dafoe's lengthy white teeth, and the fact that UB40 provide onboard cabaret."
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,50,"Despite huge resources at Mr. De Bont's disposal and the fact that both he and Ms. Bullock have achieved stellar status since ''Speed'' screeched onto movie screens, the sequel is still a B-movie at heart."
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,50,"It's all idiotic but energetic, directed by Jan De Bont in his usual techno-action style."
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,50,"The last half-hour is a decent enough ride, with Dafoe controlling the ship by Powerbook and product placement, while Bullock and Patric demonstrate the triumph of American gumption over high tech, the better to save all hands on deck."
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,50,"Nathanson's script has a disheartening let's get on with it air, and the film feels like marathon training..."
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,50,"Lacking the manipulative structure of ""Speed,"" which shrewdly interspersed rousing set pieces throughout the story, Speed 2 is vastly uneven, trying in its second hour to recoup energy and compensate the audience for all the exposition of the initial reels."
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,40,"Not nearly as clever at taxing the audience's knuckles as its forerunner, Speed 2 still manages to stay above board long enough to merit a look-see, if only to relish the once-in-a-lifetime pleasure of Mr. Dafoe and his pet leeches."
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,38,Speed 2 can be numbered among the worst second chapters ever made.
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,38,Yet Speed 2 is as slow-moving as a garbage scow. Those blinking lights might as well be emanating from a vital-signs monitor. The story is dead in the water.
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,33,"Though it displays enough perils to put a dent in future cruise ship sales, the film has a makeshift, slapdash quality that is the opposite of its predecessor."
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,30,"The screenwriters, Randall McCormick and Jeff Nathanson, and the director, Jan de Bont, have no interest in providing their actors with stuff to act."
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,30,This is my idea of a nightmare.
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,25,"And De Bont's effects are wildly over the top, devoid of the stylish cuts and intriguing angles that enriched the original. In fact, there's so little panache in his destructive action that it begins to seem like a weird act of self-destruction."
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,25,"The 1994 ""Speed,"" which starred Bullock and Keanu Reeves, was hardly ""King Lear"" on a bus, but it was an entertaining ride. But this movie is nothing but pain to sit through."
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,10,"""Speed"" made millions on mindless, empty thrills; this laborious sequel is just as mindless and empty but lacks the thrills."
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,10,"First, the good news: Unlike most action film sequels, Speed 2: Cruise Control is not a mere retread of the original. Now the bad news: Better it had been."
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,10,Speed 2 is such an inept piece of direction that it's anybody's guess whether De Bont understands how to convey where two characters are in spatial relation to each other or in relation to the action.
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,0,"This may be hard to believe, but there's not a single moment of drama or tension in any of the action sequences. And the film is made up almost entirely of action."
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,0,"The kinetics aren't that good, the twaddle is off the charts and the characters seem written by monkeys on amphetamines with crayons."
Speed 2: Cruise Control,3.8,48608066,0,"But like De Bont's awful ""Twister"", Speed 2: Cruise Control somehow manages to fail in every way."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,75,"Theron proves the master of operatic hissy fits, Blunt lets the pain show beneath the glacial cool, Chastain brings her usual Juilliard-schooled commitment to the occasion, and Hemsworth is Hemsworthian, if oft-times incomprehensible, delivering his lines in a gorse-y whorl of vowels and consonants."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,67,"It’s all pretty silly, but it compensates for a lack of emotional weight with star power."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,60,"It’s a welcome surprise: sharper and funnier than its doom-laden predecessor, with a fantasy setting immersive enough to distract from the narrative’s various chips and cracks."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,60,"With a wraparound narrative that never really strikes a balance between past and present, all that axe-flinging, ice-casting action makes a modest impact."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,58,"Winter's War isn't tedious. Amiably bad movies seldom are. Theron and Blunt look fabulous doing silly, screechy things in Colleen Atwood's costumes. Chastain makes Sara a formidable match in battle and bed with Eric, who becomes less important as these wonder women converge."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,58,"In spite of all of its myriad shortfalls, this film succeeds as well as it does because it does not shy away from this truth, and because it gives us a romances that feel so true between people we would like to see succeed."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,58,It’s the movie equivalent of a cake that’s all frosting.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,55,"If all else fails, at least it’s a movie smart enough to know that, frankly, you can’t beat Charlize Theron, covered in gold, shooting lethal spiky tentacles out of her midriff."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"By cramming far too much material into 114 minutes, The Huntsman: Winter’s War feels rushed and incomplete. It doesn’t help that the screenplay is at times awful, forcing accomplished actors to recite excruciatingly bad dialogue while maintaining a straight face."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"Unlike the smarter ""Maleficent,"" a revisionist Sleeping Beauty created by the same producers, what The Huntsman series lacks is any intriguing psychology."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"Every time Charlize Theron is on screen, the movie gets crazy campy, and therefore at least somewhat interesting."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,The mishmash of filmmaking makes it clear this was a movie made by committee — and clearly that committee was composed of folks who were not all on the same page when it came to spinning what could have been a much more engaging piece of fantasy storytelling.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"While the funny, action-packed sequences are the best parts, they are indicative of the film’s main problems: an inability to focus and an overly complicated plot."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,Pretty uninspired material for a dream-teaming of actresses who currently rate among the edgiest of them all.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"From scene to scene, there are some beautiful images in the fantasy world where this is set, but frustratingly, it never adds up to something that comes to life. This feels like terrific production design and costuming in search of a story worth telling."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"If judged by fluid effects work, Atwood’s stunning costumes, and the fun of watching Theron and Blunt reach new heights of arch camp, The Huntsman: Winter’s War is a triumph. By any other measure, though, it’s a far more qualified prospect"
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"It’s passably entertaining, and like the last one breathtakingly crafted, especially Colleen Atwood’s microscopically detailed costumes."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,42,"There’s very little in The Huntsman: Winter's War itself that is actively bad. Compared to some of its blockbuster rivals, it’s reasonably watchable, never offensive, and mostly coherent."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,It’s all too much without ever turning into much at all.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"This unintentionally fractured ends up one big mess. It's a pretty mess, mind you -- which is fitting in a way, given the sordid affair that birthed it -- but a mess all the same."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"The actors are all game, but the job’s beneath them – Hemsworth, a pro, and a real champ at faking enthusiasm for this dud; Theron, still doing camp but this time with no tempering complexity or empathy; Blunt, stuck playing a frost-bitten Mommie Dearest."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"The film borrows plenty, but it brings nothing new."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,There’s almost nothing in this movie that hasn’t been seen elsewhere before. And done a whole lot better.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"Visual inventiveness and spectacular casting can’t quite salvage a muddled fantasy epic that, if it were a magic mirror, would be held together with gaffer tape."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"In many ways this is an adult Frozen with Gothic sensibilities by way of The Lord Of The Rings, making for a derivative pastiche of the past two decades' cinematic fantasy offerings."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"All told, ‘Winter’s War’ is not the fairest sequel, but it’s not so terrible that it deserves to be taken out to the forest and finished off."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,38,The Huntsman is a flabby mess — yet another sequel with no reason to exist.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,38,"It’s a dunderheaded follow-up, for sure, but it’s at least buoyed by Chris Hemsworth’s charisma and the few times where Winter’s War embraces complete camp."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,38,"If you liked “Frozen” but wish it had been angrier, The Huntsman: Winter’s War is for you."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,38,"The overriding despair of Winter's War's imagery calls into question who, exactly, the film is for."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,33,"The film's narrative is both plodding and predictable, and after the third or fourth battle sequence that leans so heavily on loud, thudding noises and swirling leather topcoats that it's impossible to see who is actually hitting who (and, moreover, why), audiences may be in danger of remembering just which ""reimagined"" fairy tale they're watching on screen."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,30,"There’s only one reason to see The Huntsman: Winter’s War: Gowns! Insane, off-the-hook gowns."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,30,"A convoluted narrative yields not a single, palpable moment of drama."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,30,The film absolutely delivers on the scenery-chewing front. And yet the movie is still hollow and joyless.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,30,"The sheer abundance of on-screen ornamentation isn’t quite enough to make The Huntsman: Winter’s War a beautiful film.... Still, it’s one that has been exhaustively designed by many hands — which only further shows up its inelegant patchwork in the writing department."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,25,This incoherent screenplay seems to have been written by a roomful of the gorilla-like trolls who show up in the movie at one point.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,25,A resoundingly unlovable movie that almost resists being watched.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,25,"Nothing can match seeing Theron and Blunt try to out-camp each other, providing the only glimmer of entertainment in a film dedicated to being ponderous. No one sings ""Let It Go,"" but my advice to audiences is to do just that before mistakenly buying a ticket."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,25,"The mirror effects are still striking, Theron, Blunt, Hemsworth and Chastain still fairy-tale beautiful. But The Huntsman: Winter’s War, is the very picture of a movie that should have never been made. It never, for one second, gives us a reason to think otherwise."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,20,It really is a nuclear war of dullness.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,10,"Its badness is not extreme, but exemplary: It’s everything wrong with Hollywood today stuffed into a little less than two hours."
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,90,"Watching Moore battle the heavy odds may be formulaic fun, but it's genuine fun, and the formula is classic."
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,90,A very entertaining get-tough fantasy with political and feminist underpinnings.
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,88,"The training sequences are as they have to be: incredible rigors, survived by O'Neil. They are good cinema because Ridley Scott, the director, brings a documentary attention to them, and because Demi Moore, having bitten off a great deal here, proves she can chew it."
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,88,"Down in the mud with the guys, Moore finds the heart of her character and a career beyond vanity and hype. She's never looked better."
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,80,"With a strongly visual director, Ridley Scott (""Blade Runner,"" ""Alien"", the film really shows what's involved at this level of combat training."
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,75,"Director Scott, flashy, fluid and at his best in the steely-blue claustrophic battle-training scenes, immerses the viewer in the process."
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,75,Guts-and-green-beret saga.
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,70,"People who dismiss Moore and G.I. Jane out of hand are wrong, because she makes a memorably tough heroine and the movie is solid fun, even, in places, quite intelligent."
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,70,"Mr. Scott's affinity for the visceral and strenuous, from ''Alien'' to ''Blade Runner'' to ''White Squall,'' is much more central here than the renegade feminism of his ''Thelma and Louise.'' With punishing intensity, he plunges his audience into the maelstrom of the training program."
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,70,Were women put on earth to be warriors? Demi Moore certainly was. The role of Jordan fits her as snugly as a new layer of muscle.
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,67,"It's the kind of high energy, fast-paced film where you can guiltlessly root for the heroine to persevere -- but that's all it succeeds at."
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,63,The most refreshing performance is by Mortensen.
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,63,"This hot-button picture isn't especially well thought-out, but it might be crafty and manipulative enough to rile up audiences."
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,60,Bancroft and Mortensen take home the acting awards -- the pleasure they take in what they're doing really makes the film come alive.
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,60,"As a vehicle for Moore's acting abilities (and Mortensen's, for that matter), G.I. Jane is terrific. But as the end-of-summer blockbuster it's doubtless intended to be, it's pretty much a washout."
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,50,"If you're looking for a film that addresses a woman's place in a combat unit, keep waiting. If you want a film where a woman can get big muscles and shoot guns and have her husband still love her, here you are."
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,50,"G.I. Jane is liberated, all right--from good acting and a good story."
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,40,"In spite of a catalogue of downsides, including clunky dialogue, fuzzy morals and preposterous story lines, G.I. Jane does offer a perverse level of enjoyment."
G.I. Jane,5.9,48169156,40,Virtually unendurable.
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,100,"A ridiculously entertaining, perfectly paced, ultra-violent cinematic rush that kicks the places other movies struggle to reach."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,100,"It brings together several popular strains of contemporary moviemaking and combines them into one big, shameless, audacious, compulsively watchable, irresistibly likable piece of pure entertainment."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,90,"Equal parts audacious dark comedy, wish-fulfillment fantasy and over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek action-adventure."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,90,"Kick-Ass moves with such bloody assurance that you'd be forgiven for not seeing how smart it is. But smart it is. Smart, important and deadly."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,88,"The best superhero movie since ""The Dark Knight"" (and far less serious in tone or approach), Kick-Ass earns its name in every way."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,88,"Maybe I enjoyed the similarly themed Kick-Ass because it took me back to that innocent time. Or maybe it's because this is the most brazenly funny bloodbath unleashed on the public since ""Pulp Fiction."""
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,88,"Kick-Ass has punk energy, ace action moves, and a winning sense of absurdist fun."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,88,"A brutally funny deconstruction, a hybrid of “Watchmen” and “Superbad” filtered through John Woo. It’s a boisterously original piece of entertainment . . . that isn’t for everyone. Note the rating, which should be triple-R, as in Really, Remarkably R."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,83,"An enjoyably supercharged and ultraviolent teen-rebel comic-book fantasy that might be described -- in spirit, at least -- as reality-based."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,83,Director Matthew Vaughn has provided an imperfect but still wickedly hilarious take on Mark Millar's deconstruction of superhero mythos.
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,80,"A clever movie premise based on an obscure comic book has been turned into, okay we’ll say it, a fanboy’s kick-ass wet dream of a movie that could be a surprise Spring smash."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,80,"Its balancing act between innocence and gore perfectly matches the expectations of genre fans, who should embrace the movie."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,80,"For those of us who find somber superhero movies faintly ridiculous, Kick-Ass is a one-film justice league."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,80,"It's also perfectly content to be an insanely violent, funny take on an established genre. And in that respect, Kick-Ass lives up to its name."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,80,"This shrewd mixture of slick comic-book mayhem, unmistakable sweetness and ear-splitting profanity is poised to be a popular culture phenomenon because of its exact sense of the fantasies of the young male fanboy population."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,80,"With Kick-Ass, there are more cheap thrills, gory explosions and superheroes than a movie geek's YouTube mash-up."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,75,"Kick-Ass is a rabid puppy of a movie, energetically bounding off the screen and into your lap, where it proceeds to chew off your face."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,75,Kick-Ass reminds you of the great pleasures and thrills of superhero comics -- then turns everything you ever learned from comic books upside down.
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,75,"Irresponsible, morally murky, and batshit insane--in other words, Kick-Ass might be the most fun two hours you’ll spend in a movie theater. It delivers the darkly comic laughs (the movie is clearly not taking itself too seriously, so you should do likewise) as well as the jaw-dropping action, but Kick-Ass’s real accomplishment is bringing back the winkingly crazy Nic Cage we used to know and love."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,75,"Kick-Ass should delight fans of the original comics and garden-variety action junkies as well. Suggested subtitle: ""Iron Man, You Just Got Served."""
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,75,It's irreverently entertaining.
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,75,"The movie belongs to Moretz, whose sensational performance will be talked about for years. Her scenes with Cage, who wears a Batsuit and uses a voice borrowed from Adam West, are a hoot."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,75,Kick-Ass is some kind of twisted fun.
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,70,"Kick-Ass is a compendium of all sleazy things, and it sings like a siren to our inner Tarantinos."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,70,A particularly timely story about civic-mindedness and the pursuit of fame. Along with a lot of potty-mouthed ass-kicking action.
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,70,Ms. Moretz is by far the best thing about the film: she holds the screen as gracefully as she executes a running back flip.
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,63,"Fusing teen comedy, bad-boy raunch, Tarantino-style gonzo mayhem, and tossing in a bloodthirsty little girl vigilante who swears like Steve Buscemi in a Coen brothers movie, the film has its moments of high-flying, low-down style. It’s also nowhere near as subversive as it thinks it is."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,60,"Grungily stylish and often funny, at least for a while, though all of the caveats and contradictions that apply to Tarantino films apply here: One man's--or boy's--stylization is another's profane, unrelenting and tedious brutality."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,58,"Vaughn opts for comic-book bigness—big fights, big laugh lines, big explosions—but without a Spider-Man or Batman at the front of the action, Kick-Ass’s heroes and villains look smaller-than-life in a larger-than-life world."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,50,"Never as shocking as it thinks it is, as funny as it should be, or as engaged in cultural critique as it could be, Kick-Ass is half-assed."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,50,"An awkward blend of ultra-realistic violence, boundaries-bending satire and low comedy."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,50,"Vaughn did a cracking good caper film with a pre-007 Daniel Craig called ""Layer Cake"" six years ago, but Kick-Ass has little of that film's heady panache and instead batters you about the face and neck with wildly over-the-top fountains of gore, bone-cracking slow-motion, and, yes, Cage, who dials his acting down a few notches from the kicky Herzogian mindf---ery of ""Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans."""
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,50,"Since Kick-Ass' whole premise is that comic-book violence, when enacted in real life, has real consequences, it seems a strange choice to layer Tarantino-style splatter onto the Y.A.-novel setting and play the whole thing for laughs."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,50,"The standard defense of such material is that we are watching “cartoon violence,” but, when filmmakers nudge a child into viewing savagery as slapstick, are we not allowing them to do what we condemn in the pornographer--that is, to coarsen and inflame?"
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,38,"It may well be a hit, but me, I'm waiting for  ""Iron Man 2."""
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,33,Critics who come out against Kick-Ass are leaving themselves open to that worst of contemporary accusations: a failure to be cool. But pretending that Kick-Ass is just another good-time comic book blowout is the greater failure.
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,25,"Will I seem hopelessly square if I find Kick-Ass morally reprehensible and will I appear to have missed the point? Let’s say you’re a big fan of the original comic book, and you think the move does it justice. You know what? You inhabit a world I am so very not interested in."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,20,"Kick-Ass - based on a graphic novel - thinks it's so brave and bold. But it's more like the title character, a dweeb who just thinks he's tough."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,100,"Visually astonishing and touchingly told, Kubo is utterly wonderful."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,100,"If you want to expose your children to a work of art with real soul, you could do a lot worse than Kubo and the Two Strings."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,100,"Kubo works because it is so direct, so honest about the emotional story it’s telling. Knight may have epic ambitions, but he keeps the stakes very personal."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,100,"The action is gorgeously fluid, the idiosyncratic 3-D visual conceits (including floating eyeballs undersea) are startling, and the story and its metaphors resolve in unexpected and moving ways."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,100,"""Kubo"" is both extraordinarily original and extraordinarily complex."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,100,"From its opening image — of a distraught woman battling massive ocean waves on a moonlit night — to its surprisingly ambiguous final shot — of what, I won't say — Kubo and the Two Strings sears itself into your brain."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,100,"Staggeringly beautiful and immensely true, the best animated film of 2016 — one of the year’s best films of any kind, really."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,100,"Representing a dazzling artistic leap forward for LAIKA, the stop-motion animation studio’s fourth feature — and first full-blown fantasy — is an eye-popping delight that deftly blends colorful folklore with gorgeous, origami-informed visuals to immersive effect."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,91,"A simple story told well can still be effective if the emotional resonance underneath it comes through. In Kubo, it absolutely does, thanks to the uniformly excellent voice performances."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,91,"Kubo and the Two Strings feels like a miracle, evoking joy, surprise and wonder in its audience."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,91,"A visually stunning, richly imagined oasis in a sea of candy-colored safety, and one of the first truly original movies of the year so far."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,90,"Displaying the mastery of visuals and storytelling of a more established veteran, Laika president Travis Knight has gone beyond merely crafting a confident directorial debut; he’s made the studio’s best film to date."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,90,"It recognizes that our most cherished legends are an endless source of consolation in times of suffering and loss, as well as a vital repository of cultural and generational memory. If that message sounds trite or familiar, it has rarely been driven home with this much conviction and intensity of feeling."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,90,The story is captivating from the very first moments.
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,90,"With such awe-inspiring artistry, designed so as to never distract from the material it serves, Kubo and the Two Strings stands as the sort of film that feels richer with each successive viewing, from the paper-folded Laika logo at the beginning (an early taste of the stunning origami sequences to follow) to the emotional resonance of its final shot."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,89,"Visually inventive and offering up a complex view of family interaction, Kubo and the Two Strings is another feather in the cap for Laika, and a marvel to behold."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,88,The best animated feature (at least thus far) of 2016.
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,88,"It is definitely the summer for talking animals taking over the cinema, but Kubo manages to rise above the rest of its peers with a wondrous coming-of-age tale full of ancient soul."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,88,"One of the most impressive elements of Kubo and the Two Strings — besides its dazzling stop-motion animation, its powerful performances and its transporting score — is the amount of credit it gives its audience, particularly its younger viewers."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,88,"The movie is genuinely creative, genuinely outside-the-box, and often genuinely scary; parents of toddlers and nightmare-prone children are herewith warned."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,88,"As Kubo warns, early on, don’t blink — you might miss something. Something that — and what a treat this is — you’ve never seen before."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,88,"An imaginative, scary and wonderfully rendered stop-motion fright."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,83,"This is Laika’s least droll, least ghoulish feature so far; the plotting is even more dreamlike than ""Coraline."""
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,83,"It’s not a flawless movie, but there’s real magic in it, and that’s more important, and no less rare, than perfection."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,80,"The film doesn’t quite cut loose to hit emotional high notes, but Regina Spektor’s velvety cover of “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” poignantly completes a sweet, generous film."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,80,The first and last things to be said in this limited space about Kubo and the Two Strings are that it’s a showcase for some of the most startlingly beautiful animation in recent — and not so recent — memory.
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,80,"The tale is layered and lovely, although talk about the real self, eternity and death will stun the adults in the audience."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,80,It’s a beautifully animated tale (keep your eyes on the way Kubo’s hair moves) that balances story with comedy and moments of effective (if light) horror.
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,75,The stunning visuals and beautifully conceived milieu distract the viewer from the fact that the quest structure of the story is McGuffin-like and the conclusion emotionally muddled.
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,75,"Despite a traditional-seeming quest for a suit of armor and a sword, the film’s intrinsic message is all about the transformative powers of music and love. It’s a movie the whole family can rock out to."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,75,"I cannot stress enough how truly stunning the brilliant visuals are in this movie. Laika has again crafted a world that is such an original vision, one that will live on as a new classic in the world of animation."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,75,"Steeped in the mythology and fables of Japanese history, it’s another fantastical adventure from the studio with innovation and awe at every turn, despite a story that could benefit from having more specificity and focus."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,75,It offers a powerful metaphor for the manner in which we carry the memories of our departed inside ourselves.
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,65,"If only there was as much thought put into the characters as there was the visuals. For all of his convoluted backstory, Kubo is a remarkably unconflicted character, and barely faces a moment of internal turmoil throughout the entire film."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,63,"The characters feel underdeveloped, to the point where it’s sometimes difficult to remain invested in their triumphs and failures."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,58,"Kubo and the Two Strings is lovely to behold, if viewers manage to keep their eyes open. It's an animated doozy and drowser at once, an uncomfortable mix of Miyazaki-style imagination and generic dullness."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,50,"What Laika achieves is an effective mixture of hyper-real and hyper-stylized, a combination that keeps “Kubo” appealing to the eye for audiences of all ages. If the film’s plotting and dialogue had measured up, “Kubo” might have been a masterpiece."
Kubo and the Two Strings,7.8,48023088,40,"Little kids will be bored, as there are only a few scenes with any action, and of those, only one, featuring an enormous skeleton with swords sticking out of its skull, has any oomph."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,88,"Once in the jungle they have all sorts of harrowing adventures, and I enjoyed it that real things were happening, that we were not simply looking at shoot-outs and chases, but at intriguing and daring enterprise."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,80,"Surprisingly airy, jungle-set adventure, boisterously winking at Huston, Peckinpah and the same Saturday-morning serials that birthed Indiana Jones. R.J. Stewart and James Vanderbilt's tongue-in-cheek script, a hybridization of ""Midnight Run"" and ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" provides lots of amusing byplay for its two mismatched stars."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,80,"There've been dozens of shotgun movies, most of them directed by Sam Peckinpah (""The Wild Bunch,"" ""The Getaway"") but Berg is inventive...All this, and Christopher Walken too? What more could a fella ask for?"
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,75,"The Rundown is actually a lot of fun, mostly because The Rock, simply by standing there and being The Rock, cancels out Scott entirely."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,75,"Has what we usually want to see in movies like this: bravura action, tongue-in-cheek humor, but most of all attitude."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,75,"Quite a bit of fun. In fact, in its own good-natured, silly way, it works better than most of the year's other adventure-gutbusters."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,75,"Offers everything a good movie of this sort should: plenty of suspenseful action, a few good laughs, and a share of obligatory ""reluctant buddy"" bonding."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,75,"An action-adventure flick that could turn into this generation's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."""
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,75,"The screenplay is laced with wit and sharp dialogue, and the supporting cast more than makes up for Johnson's inexperience and occasional stiffness."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,75,"The action sequences are novel, the performances are slightly askew, and the camera work is vigorous and mostly effective."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,75,"Surprisingly clever, high-energy adventure (director Peter Berg should be proud)."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,70,"Those not in the smackdown frame of mind will find an overabundance of head-butts, body slams and pounding aural effects -- this is a definite contender for loudest film of the year -- but also will discover instances of innovative, spectacular stuntwork and, though the comic interplay often falls flat, a story with heart."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,70,"The Rock and Scott work up some nice comic chemistry, but its the dependably warped Walken who steals the most scenes. The frenetically edited fight sequences will satisfy the blood lust of the target audience."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,70,Cements the Rock's status as a contempo action hero with a bigscreen future.
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,70,"Johnson, who was computer-generated in ""Mummy"" and only looked it in ""Scorpion King,"" keeps it engaging, displaying a comedic knack first revealed during his Saturday Night Live appearance in 2000; he has the timing of a Rolex, even when playing straight man to American Pie's Stifler."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,70,"Turns out he's infinitely more likable than Vin Diesel, who carries his sense of stardom through every movie like an insufferable Atlas. In fact, Dwayne Johnson is a gentleman, the kind of Rock who puts you in a very easy place."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,70,"It's fun, albeit a little messy, under the frequently punchy direction of Peter Berg."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,67,"Doesn't break any new ground, but it doesn't leave you wishing you had stayed home, either. Considering the state of action movies today, that's something."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,63,Comes on like a runaway Humvee.
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,63,"An amiable action-comedy, amiable enough that the laughs come in a steady drizzle if not a torrent, and that the action is something blissfully less than the usual full-out assault on our battered senses."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,63,"Aggressively adolescent. It hearkens back to the time in a young man's life when humping monkeys were funny, when a promise didn't count if your fingers were crossed, when debating pointless hypothetical questions held a fascination, and when professional wrestling offered endless, senseless entertainment."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,60,"Is he (Rock) the next big thing? After seeing The Rundown, one of the most joyfully silly genre films in recent history, he has my vote."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,60,"For a mountain of muscle [The Rock]'s a surprisingly charming screen presence. And his low-key appeal helps nudge Peter Berg's derivative but good-natured light action picture in the direction of breezy entertainment, rather than painfully noisy macho posturing."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,60,"This is basically a 10th-tier rehash of the Indiana Jones genre, laced with moments that are actually clever and exciting. Dawson is alluring, Scott is smug and bratty, Walken is terrific, and The Rock is, well, The Rock."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,50,"For much of the film, Berg is content to act like a Michael Bay wannabe, orchestrating large action set pieces that get increasingly tiresome and WWE-like as individuals get mindlessly slammed into the dust."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,50,"Peter Berg directs the action sequences cleverly at first. Then he starts to behave as though a hornet flew down his pants at the instant he aimed the camera. He's not much of a dialogue director, but there's not much dialogue."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,50,Somehow the star emerges from this mess smelling like pure testosterone. You can't stop the Rock.
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,50,"The director, Peter Berg (""Very Bad Things""), keeps the predictable story line on course without developing a truly compelling momentum in the action sequences or finding anything fresh in the interaction of the stock characters."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,50,The Rock has a flair for action and comedy; he's a real movie star.
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,50,"By nature, the character (Rock) is as gentle and affable as this Amazonian adventure is -- a yarn complete with an oddball robber baron, pro football linemen, Type-A monkeys and hallucinogenic fruit."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,50,"Add Christopher Walken, giving one of his patented demented performances as a Kurtz-esque mining tycoon deep in the Amazon jungle, along with some vague Hollywood politics about labor exploitation, and The Rundown is far too cheerful and good-hearted to be terrible."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,50,"The Rock deserves better than The Rundown, a brisk, good- hearted but predictable and uninspired - not to mention bone-crunchingly violent - action comedy."
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,50,"The result rises to the level of mediocrity thanks largely to the magnetic presence of The Rock, who's made a smooth transition from professional wrestling to leading-man status with this and ""The Scorpion King."""
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,50,To call this action gambit formulaic is to sell it short: The Rundown runs down more formulas than a month's worth of complimentary premium cable service.
The Rundown,6.7,47726342,30,"Like rocky road ice cream, The Rundown is chunky stuff, full of calories and easy to take in small doses. Also like rocky road, its bound to attract flies if you leave it lying around, and, more to the point, too much of it is likely to make you gag."
New Jack City,6.6,47624253,88,"The movie isn't a comic book that's been assembled out of the spare parts from other crime movies; it's an original, in-depth look at this world, written and directed with concern—apparently after a lot of research and inside information."
New Jack City,6.6,47624253,88,"The ""Godfather"" films transcended their mobster genre; New Jack City doesn't, but it's a great genre film, edgy, vibrant and full of urgent color."
New Jack City,6.6,47624253,80,"The film's flamboyant portrait of Nino may be stereotypical, but Mr. Snipes makes it chilling."
New Jack City,6.6,47624253,75,"Filmmakers pull off a provocative, pulsating update on gangster pics with this action-laden epic about the rise and fall of an inner city crack dealer. Strongest element is the anger and disgust directed squarely at drug dealers."
New Jack City,6.6,47624253,75,"Despite its preachiness, we all know New Jack City is making the right statement on drugs, racism, the system, etc. But the fact is it's not very good."
New Jack City,6.6,47624253,75,The movie has no sense of temptation and no real taste for revolt-it's a good little film that knows its place. Van Peebles' direction has a by-the-numbers competence but no discernible personality.
New Jack City,6.6,47624253,70,"Bad as the overall design remains, individual scenes keep sparking alive, partly because the dialogue, or delivery, seems fresh, and improvisatory; partly because Van Peebles, in his directorial debut, figures out unusual or athletic camera designs for every scene. It's obvious he has talent, equally obvious there's no way this story can work right, no matter how strenuous the staging."
New Jack City,6.6,47624253,60,"It’s got some talented actors and a certain jagged inner-city atmosphere, yet this first feature directed by Mario Van Peebles (son of the veteran black director Melvin Van Peebles) is little more than a sketchy exploitation melodrama."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,75,Into the Storm is as straightforward a disaster film as you're likely to find.
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,75,It's hard to imagine any movie ever topping this one's depiction of killer tornadoes laying waste to the Midwest.
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,75,"The found-footage disaster flick Into the Storm is “Twister’’ for dummies, but by no means is that an insult. The new film is enormous fun if you’re in the right mood."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,67,"Into the Storm captures the magnificence of tornadoes, their awful beauty when they set down, the devastation they wreak, and the enormity of their consequences. The film features a rich array of well-developed characters – including the storm itself – which makes it ever more involving as it unfolds."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,63,"Bring on the bread and circuses. Into the Storm features laughable dialogue, far-fetched situations, and generic characters played by actors who almost look like more famous stars. I still had a blast; and if you lower your resistance, you may too."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,63,"Not all of it makes sense, but for disaster movie fans, Into the Storm has enough destruction to go around."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,60,"Its story line and performances are no more than serviceable, but those terrible twisters are state of the art."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,60,"To give the film its full due, the people who made it — the writer, John Swetnam, and the director, Steven Quale — got wind of a genuine trend and ran with it. Everyone on screen is busy filming everyone else. It's a shakier-camera version of ""The Blair Witch Project"" in the era of YouTube."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,58,"The film barely services the main characters and their arcs, so there's really no room for the sort of delicate etching needed to make supporting characters live and breathe. The film is at its best when it embraces the goofy nature of disaster films in general, and when it gives the audience the red meat it craves so desperately."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,58,"Into The Storm is an uncanny valley disaster movie — not as consciously cheesy and cheap as something like ""Sharknado 2,"" but built around a similar equation of unreality and gratification."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,50,"The structure and impressive effects of Into the Storm could keep viewers entertained on a rainy weekend evening but it’s the shallow, non-existent characterizations that keep it from working."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,50,"This film is actually less menacing than marveling, though a disturbing opening scene in a storm-tossed van could fit right into Mr. Quale’s earlier work."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,50,"One-dimensional characters play second fiddle to the main event. Given the large cast of faceless players, it's hard to care when a few get sucked into oblivion."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,50,"If we don’t care a whit about the characters and their respective dilemmas, a multiple-vortex tornado ripping through a used car lot is just a multiple-vortex tornado ripping through a used car lot."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,50,"Into the Storm plays like a special-effects demonstration in search of a movie, but you have to give it to the filmmakers: They take no half-measures."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,50,"There are many instances of questionable logic in Into the Storm, but the most persistent is the film's unexplained assumption that tornado-hunting is a growth industry."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,50,"As impressive as the effects can be, as effective as the blend of TV news helicopter POV shots, security camera footage, cell-phone video and storm chaser images mimicked here turn out, the human stories are given short shrift in this “spend our budget on effects” action picture."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,50,"As clumsy as Quale is with the sequences of people shouting exposition back and forth, or delivering teary Blair Witch-style goodbyes into a camera that would have died long before its operators, he handles the CGI action with breathless intensity."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,40,"When you're pining for Bill Paxton and the relative emotional realism of Twister, you know you're in trouble."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,40,"Its destructive setpieces may loose the odd popcorn kernel on to the multiplex carpet, but it's really just an effects reel: the weather – cloudy wisps turning to massive, fiery hellblasts – is considerably better developed than its quarry. Stick with Twister."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,40,"Too cartoonish to be cathartic, and too ghoulish to be honest fun, Into the Storm is mostly a somewhat uncomfortable sit enlivened by occasional hilariousness."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,40,Into the Storm is at once one of the dumbest films you'll see this year and one of the scariest.
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,40,"Once Quale and writer John Swetnam get their generic setup out of the way, they can loosen up and treat the tornadoes like the villains they are. The effectively simulated storms, with their massive wreckage, start to feel like monsters stalking the heroes."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,40,"The script by John Swetnam is rudimentary, with only the most minimal and pallid stabs at characterization... Nevertheless, once the funnel clouds begin swirling, Quale and his special effects team achieve some remarkably authentic and frightening moments."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,38,"Hollywood's latest entry in that tried-and-true genre, the disaster movie, is . . . well, it's like . . . a totally gnarly roller-coaster ride!"
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,38,"Nobody watches a disaster movie starring digital tornadoes expecting Oscar Wilde. But Into the Storm, directed with bland efficiency by Steven Quayle of ""Final Destination 5,"" reminds us that unless a movie establishes certain base-line levels of human interest, it runs the not-unentertaining risk of coming out squarely in favor of its own bad weather."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,37,"For all the movie’s grandiose annihilation, there also is action so absurd and emotion so saccharine that the likelihood of involuntary laughter is high."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,30,"At the climax of Into the Storm, colossal tornadoes make noise, blow things up, and go around in circles; that's pretty much all the film does, too."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,30,"Into the Storm can make it rain like nobody’s business, but when it tries to be smart, it comes out all wet."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,25,"If the film had been trimmed to 45 minutes of crazed storm-chasing and storm-fleeing, it might've been worth a matinee ticket. But as is, it's the sort of lazy late-summer idiocy you'd be wise to huddle beneath an overpass to avoid."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,25,"Many movies require us to turn off our brains, and many rely on clichés and/or coincidences. It takes a special kind of shamelessness to do both, and Into the Storm has that in spades."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,25,"Even within the spinning cylinder of mediocrity that is Into The Storm, there are some minor pleasures to be had. Those are mostly found in Walsh, who is probably best known for comedic supporting turns, but makes the most with what is nearly a leading man part here."
Hard to Kill,5.8,47410000,70,"Mr. Seagal is effective for both his novelty value and his ability to be both literally and figuratively disarming. And the film itself is a lively one for its genre, ambitious enough to do more than simply string fight scenes together."
Hard to Kill,5.8,47410000,63,"Director Bruce Malmuth keeps the pace taut, the shots tight."
Hard to Kill,5.8,47410000,63,"As it is, Hard to Kill has just enough going for it between the explosions and bone-crunching fight scenes to qualify as two hours of solid, high-decibel action entertainment."
Hard to Kill,5.8,47410000,60,"It ain’t pretty, but it gets the action fans off."
Hard to Kill,5.8,47410000,60,One for fans only.
Hard to Kill,5.8,47410000,50,"While Seagal is spraying bullets, breaking bones and throwing interchangeable bad guys through windows, this has a certain mindless appeal. But Malmuth's flaccid direction lacks the vicious muscularity and authentic edge of Seagal's previous feature."
Hard to Kill,5.8,47410000,40,"At this point, revenge thrillers have become so standardized that these films are really all the same film — a Mixmaster blend of Death Wish, Dirty Harry, Enter the Dragon, and Rambo. A star with a personality would only gum up the works."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,88,"A gargantuan epic, a historical adventure-drama of overwhelming visual grandeur."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,88,"Bloom finally comes into his own as a man here, somberly thoughtful and melancholic. The elfin archer of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the trivial boy-toy of ""Troy"" have been forgotten."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,88,"Better than ""Gladiator"" -- deeper, more thoughtful, more about human motivation and less about action."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,83,"Its concept is gutsy, its script is literate and intelligent, its visuals and cinematic craftsmanship are mouth-dropping, and its vision of the insanity of various religions vying to dominate the real estate of the Holy Land comes through with great power."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,80,"Genuinely spectacular and historically quite respectable, Ridley Scott's latest epic is at its strongest in conveying the savagery spawned by fanaticism."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,80,Fulfills the requirements of grand-scale moviemaking while serving as a timely reminder that in the conflict between Christianity and Islam it was the Christians who picked the first fight.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,80,"In its depiction of a fleeting, but nevertheless factual, peace in the Middle East, Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven may seem a more quixotic Hollywood fantasy than all six Star Wars movies lumped together."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,80,"Scott and company have gotten so accomplished at re-creating history that the results have a welcome offhanded quality, making them spectacular without seeming to be showing off."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,80,"Full of astonishments, not the least of which are its ideas."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,78,"The story's parallels with the present are sometimes inescapable, as when Saladin's fireballs catapulted at Balian's castle strike an eerie resemblance to the ""shock and awe"" of the U.S.-led coalition's initial assault on Iraq."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,75,"Kingdom of Heaven may have problems, but it delivers."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,75,"Odd as it is to say, Kingdom of Heaven loses its momentum the more Balian gets religion."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,75,"A rousing, politically correct, Muslim-sympathetic, $140 million take on the Crusades."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,75,"Scott's cast is like a grand orchestra with various performers filling the roles of instruments: Thewlis a wise, ironic oboe; Neeson a stout cello; Norton a slightly battered flute. As it happens, the piece they're playing is a piano concerto and the keyboard -- that is, Bloom -- isn't big enough to match."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,75,Screenwriter William Monahan has fashioned an intelligent and highly topical epic. Director Ridley Scott has brought it home with banners flying.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,70,The battle skirmishes here mix sudden violence with slow-motion artistry. The attractive cast can sell an obsession or articulate a conundrum with equal fervor.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,70,"So, if you want to see this loud but rather ordinary epic, don't expect its tricked-up cultural and theological messages to carry much water. For entertainment value, it's hard to beat the climactic siege of Jerusalem, a Ridley Scott-perfect half-hour that matches anything in ""Troy"" or ""Gladiator"" for sheer, bloody, helmet-bashing mayhem."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,70,Thoughtful and impressively mounted.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,70,"Massoud plays Saladin magnetically, and his arrival only illustrates how many opportunities Kingdom misses. Another, better movie would have made him the focus."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,67,"Scott, working from a script by William Monahan, is so busy balancing our sympathies, making sure no one gets offended, that he has made a pageant of war that would have gotten a thumbs-up from Eleanor Roosevelt."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,63,"But if the film disappoints on an intellectual level, at least it doesn't skimp on pageantry. This is, without question, one of the most beautifully crafted, visually thrilling war pictures ever made -- a painterly spectacle that leaves you looking for Caravaggio's name in the end credits."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,63,"It's hard to say with assurance whether the flaw is in Bloom's performance or in Monahan's politically correct conception of Balian, precociously secular for a Crusader."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,63,"Although Scott seems to be making a point about both parties' ongoing feud for Jerusalem , the movie seems more like a classic Western than a contemporary political allegory."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,63,"For all its scale, grandeur, historical context and political brass, ""Kingdom"" is no more compelling a period drama than last year's ""Alexander."""
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,63,What sucks the wind out of the movie's sails is the vacuum at its core.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,60,"A frustratingly thin epic. You're left wanting more exposition, more character development, the tidying up of loose ends."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,60,"One imagined that a movie about the Crusades would be gallant and mad; one feared that it might stoke some antiquated prejudice. But who could have dreamed that it would produce this rambling, hollow show about a boy?"
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,60,"The movie does what any self-respecting politician would do: sidestep the issues, soft-pedal mortal costs, talk a fat game, and divert your attention away from history with exercises in spectacle and power."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,60,A handful of nifty battle scenes and some decent performances aren't quite enough to make Kingdom memorable.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,60,"Fails to rouse any passion. A potentially great subject is frittered away, though this being a Scott movie, there's style to spare."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,Bottom line: Kingdom of Heaven is the most exciting action-adventure yarn so far this year. Just don't expect anything deeper.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,"Scott's ravishing visual style, characterized by a fetishistic attention to surface detail and unrelenting beauty, can work wonders with big subjects, but this is also a director who needs actors powerful enough to shoulder narrative and emotional extremes."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,"Dramatically, even a persuasive supporting cast gets Heaven only so far."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,"I'd have a lot more respect for Scott if he were actually the virtuoso he pretends to be. ""Gladiator"" had lousy, disjunctive action, and Kingdom of Heaven is even more maladroit."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,"Ultimately, despite striving mightily to give everyone a fair shake, the film kindled the ire of conservative Christians and Muslims anyway."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,"A mostly lumbering, occasionally rousing epic that walks a bizarre line between historical fact and Hollywood wishful thinking."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,The movie espouses a kind of Unitarian ecumenical egalitarianism that has about as much to do with medieval times as quantum physics. No one should be offended except -- of course -- those who like movies that excite the mind as well as the pulse.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,40,This is muddled and oppressive storytelling (the script is by William Monahan) dotted with elaborate but weightless battle sequences.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,40,To introduce an archetype like this to western audiences -- as the world weathers culturally and religiously demonizing times -- may have been worth this whole flawed movie. Too bad the story didn't just start with him.
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,85,Who cares if the story is occasionally impenetrable or if some gags land with a thud when the thrills and the eye candy keep coming at such a breathless pace? Jupiter Ascending doesn’t break the new ground that the Wachowskis have managed in the past...but the film never slacks in its efforts to wow us.
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,83,"Fast, frequently teetering on the cusp of the ridiculous, and eye-poppingly pretty, Jupiter Ascending is a wicked slice of entertainment, and a heck of an antidote to the typical February box-office blahs."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,80,"Both visually and in the action stakes, Jupiter Ascending could give pretty much any space movie a run for its money."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,75,"A film very much of its moment, in ways both good and bad. But the important thing is that its virtues are extraordinary, while its flaws are easy to forget because they’re so common."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,75,"It is, in other words, just a few musical numbers and a whiff of marijuana smoke short of being the Thomas Pynchon book of big-budget, effects-driven movie sci-fi."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,70,"The movie's a fascinating mess, grand and gaudy, often hilarious."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,63,A beautiful muddle.
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,63,"Jupiter Ascending feels like a truncated, Cliffs Notes version of something that might have worked a lot better as a mini-series. Two hours is too short for this tale and the end result suffers greatly because of that restriction."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,60,"It’s all very chaotic and entertaining, like a bizarre cult sci-fi TV show that somehow survived a threat of mid-season cancellation."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,60,"This is one mad mess from start to finish... But the sheer ambition is impossible to ignore, and the sense of fun is infectious: you may fear for your sanity during Jupiter Ascending, but you’ll come out smiling."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,58,"Jupiter Ascending’s early cleverness dries up quickly, especially when Kunis is offscreen, leaving us with just another incoherent sci-fi spectacle."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"It has the kind of jumbled, pseudo-spectacular, overdecorated digital design that the eye and mind can’t really take in. Individual shots can be gorgeous, but there are just too damn many of them, and the overall experience is the visual equivalent of eating an entire wedding cake."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"As for Kunis, she gets to wear some out-of-this-world couture, and gets to make her entrance at a marriage ceremony on a floating dais, kind of like Katy Perry at the Super Bowl."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"I enjoyed this movie more than the last two films from the Wachowskis, the interminable ""Cloud Atlas"" and ""Speed Racer."" On the other hand, ""The Matrix"" it's not."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"With its nods to the original “Star Trek” and David Lynch’s proto-steampunk hallucination “Dune,” it seduces the eye with filigreed flourishes even as the mind reels from some of the mildewy storytelling."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"Jupiter Ascending is best during its purely visual moments, of which there are many... All of which makes it a shame that the only sense the Wachowskis can count on is their visual one."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"An instant candidate for the so-bad-it’s-sort-of-great hall of fame, Jupiter Ascending is totally bonkers, a sort of black-velvet-Elvis mash-up of “Star Wars’’ and every other sci-fi/fantasy movie of the past half-century right up to “The Hunger Games.”"
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"The movie doesn't really work, but the jet boots would be the envy of Iron Man, and they allow our hero, unwisely named Caine Wise, to speedskate through the air, leaving pretty little trails of light over downtown Chicago."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"Though it strives mightily to compete in every category, it’s not as funny as Guardians, as awe-inspiring as Interstellar, as thrilling as Edge Of Tomorrow, or as provocative as Under The Skin."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"It's blandly, often listlessly bad, check-the-blockbuster-boxes bad, just-out-of-film-school-and-shopping-a-tentpole-screenplay bad."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,40,"Cinema-goers desperately need a fresh, unusual and franchise-free blockbuster to rally behind, but Jupiter Ascending isn’t it."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,40,The Wachowskis never lack for ambition. It's in the execution where they run into trouble.
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,40,"Like too much filmed space opera, this is wonderfully imaginative when it comes to costume, art direction, special effects, spaceships and incidental alien creatures but stuck with old-hat character types and a resolutely unspecial storyline. It’s frequently entertaining, but as much for its terrible moments as its inspired touches."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,40,"Even with all its familiar action tropes, less-than-fresh special effects and loopy plotting, the most depressing element in the Wachowski siblings' latest sci-fi mash is that, as they conceive it, human society has been around for more than a billion years but is still presided over by a rivalrous British-style royal family that treacherously behaves as if it were the 1550s."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,40,"While the Wachowskis have always put their greatest emphasis on aesthetics, they allow the visual impulse to get the best of them here, investing so much attention in creating unique fashions, technology, architecture and design that they’ve blinded themselves to the huge logical gaps in their own story."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,38,"Dazzling to behold yet puny of imagination, the movie takes the “Star Wars” formula — hero myths nicked from Joseph Campbell, cutting-edge visual effects, comic-strip dialogue, goofy-looking aliens — and reduces it to generic Big Box shelf product."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,38,"The sci-fi film's reported $175 million budget must have gone largely into loopy production design, wild costumes, outlandish hairstyles and colorful make-up. It certainly didn't go into developing a coherent script or coaching believable performances."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,38,"The film is ntermittently inventive in its visual and physical effects, but its politics are unthinking and obvious, a cheap anti-authoritarian tantrum imbedded in an intergalactic action-melodrama."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,38,"Channing Tatum is a lot of things, but he’s not a stoic Superman like the role he plays here, which is made more laughable by prosthetic pointy ears."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,38,An excruciatingly empty chunk of eye candy that spends over two hours trying to convince us they’re not ripping off “Dune.”
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,37,It seems that Andy and Lana Wachowski have never lost that childlike ability to dream. But they also haven’t mastered the grown-up power to rein it in. The story they tell in Jupiter Ascending could probably occupy an entire television season. There’s way too much here for one movie to hold.
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,30,"While the totality of Jupiter Ascending is just too much for its own massive narrative heft to support, kudos to the Wachowskis for beating back against mainstream Hollywood by casting actors of all races and genders in key roles, something they’ve been doing since their 1996 debut ""Bound."""
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,25,"The most frustrating thing about the movie (as with “Cloud Atlas”) is that it could’ve been memorable, had the Wachowskis turned their vision over to more talented storytellers."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,25,"This kind of pandering FX padding, unnurtured by humor or heart, is what shifts Jupiter Ascending from a shambles to a fiasco. In an effort to win back audiences by lowering their standards and their daring, the Wachowskis wind up where you never expected to find them creatively: on the ropes."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,25,The creators of Jupiter Ascending spent $175 million on special effects and 25 cents on a story. Audiences do not get their money's worth.
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,25,"Sadly, Jupiter Ascending turns out to be the exact opposite: the worst movie the Wachowskis have ever made."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,20,"Talk about lost in space. The whacked-out outer-space melodrama Jupiter Ascending has embedded in its genes the DNA of “Barbarella” and “Flash Gordon,” some dust from “Dune” and even a bit of Michael Jackson’s Disneyland short “Captain Eo.”"
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,16,"There is an emptiness that lingers around Jupiter Ascending. From the lack of original thought in its conception to the expensive excess in its execution, the directors' usual bag of tricks can't manage to fill the void."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,0,"Heaping derision on such a woeful debut may be tantamount to shooting fossils in a tar pit. Yet this lumbering industrial enterprise, which was written and directed by the Wachowski siblings, Andy and Lana, is bad enough to be granted landmark status."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,0,There’s no defending Jupiter Ascending. There’s no explaining Jupiter Ascending. There’s no way Jupiter Ascending isn’t making an appearance on my list of the Worst Films of 2015.
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,75,"The performances of Travis Fimmel, Toby Kebbell and Paula Patton as the warrior Lothar, the orc hero Durotan and the half-orc/half-woman Garona, all awakening to the evil forces around them, are meaty enough to hold attention."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,75,"Warcraft wins by not trying to be the second coming of a 10-hour cinematic trip through Mordor with Hobbits and jewelry. Rather, it’s a simpler, yet still wholly entertaining tale of magic and larger-than-life soldiers in a battle for survival."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,62,"It's a knock-down, drag-out fight between storytelling, franchise-making, and fan service, and some casualties were inevitable. But even a messy fight for nuance is better than an apathetic sell-out."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,60,"Tasked with brokering a peace between event-sized thrills, gaming lore and high fantasy, Jones embraces Warcraft’s world with laudable commitment: but when it comes to charging it with life, sheer bulk gets the better of him."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,60,"The movie is character-driven every step of the way. That’s why, even if the world created by Jones and his talented design collaborators, both old-school physical and cutting-edge digital, isn’t seamlessly believable so much as staggeringly crafted, it casts a spell."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,58,"Warcraft errs in how much it asks the audience to juggle, and as a result, the things that the film does well (and I think there are many) are muffled somewhat."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,50,Warcraft provides the shell of a great fantasy adventure saga but never effectively goes beyond that. This is much more like the bad fantasy of the 1980s and 1990s than the better brand we have recently become accustomed to.
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,50,The dialogue is so earnest that its lack of humor becomes a source of humor in itself. The acting is so primal that you’ll swear a porn sequence is about to break out.
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,50,"There are stretches of tedium in this lumpy and derivative mythology, to be sure. But there are also immersive IMAX 3-D backdrops, striking ambiguities and irresistible moments of straight-faced lunacy. The line between hack work and labor of love may be perilously thin, but you can sense the difference in the way Jones earnestly, wholeheartedly embraces the magic that powers this realm."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,50,"Probably the best way to experience Warcraft, a generally amusing and sometimes visually arresting absurdity, is stoned. If watching the big screen through a cannabis cloud isn’t your idea of a good movie time, though, I suggest that you do what I did and just go with the incoherent flow."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,50,"No, Warcraft isn’t a ridiculous mess; it holds together on its own musclebound terms. It neither tries to be jokey nor undercuts itself by being unintentionally funny. And it offers a bit more complexity than some other nonstop action flicks adapted from video games. It’s a real movie, just not a good one."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,50,"Proceed with caution to ""Warcraft,"" but there is entertainment to be found here. It's certainly more absorbing than the lazily assembled ""Alice Through the Looking Glass,"" because Jones' exertion and drive behind the film is palpable, if a bit sweaty."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,50,"In spite of these deficiencies — the narrative wildness, the static characters, the impenetrable lore — Warcraft is still not entirely a failure, most of all because of its charming, almost admirable level of goofy conviction."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,50,"Warcraft may provide grand, thunderous spectacle as it transforms human actors into hulking Orcs, but when trying to perform the alchemy of transmuting genre archetypes into characters with soul, the magic fizzles out."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,40,"You may not particularly enjoy Warcraft, but you kind of have to admire the audacity of its existence."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,40,It aims to match the mythic gravitas of “The Lord of the Rings” — even throwing in a nod to the Book of Exodus for good measure — and the results fall paint-by-numbers flat.
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,40,"The ambition is laudible, but it's to little end. At once empty and impenetrable, this brings to mind a mix of John Carter and Dungeons And Dragons, regrettably in both themes and level of enjoyment."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,40,"The total absence of originality here is notable, but it needn’t have been a problem: with a tighter plot, a touch of humour and some peppier, less slab-fisted action scenes this might actually have worked – a kind of Guardians of the Galaxy meets Lord of the Rings."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,40,"The pristine setting never meshes with Jones’s efforts to give emotional reality to his army of characters, who cannot escape their tropes: leader, hero, warrior woman, mystic."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,40,"Director Duncan Jones, a self-professed Warcraft fan, has clearly put a lot of love and care into fleshing out a story, but it’s questionable whether it was ever really merited. There’s a terminal flimsiness, as if this virtually-derived world hasn’t quite assumed three dimensions."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,40,"The film takes a long time to build dramatic momentum and gets interrupted by what seem like unnecessary plot points; some of them, perhaps, geared towards potential sequels."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,38,"Just because you can come up with names such as Azeroth, Durotan, Orgrim, and Grommash Hellscream doesn't mean you're J.R.R. Tolkien, people."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,38,"There’s nary an honorable death that resonates, although we do get some creative visual perspectives on enthusiastically digitized brutality. But wasn’t the game good for that already?"
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,38,"This loud, bombastic, often incoherent mishmash of magical-themed storytelling simply was not worth whatever effort went into it. While there are some acceptable action sequences, it’s the screenplay — complicated by some less than inspired performances — that dooms “Warcraft” at every point along the way."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,38,The Warcraft hardcore can rejoice. Everyone else can move along. There’s not much to see here.
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,33,"Jones slaves to make something of the material, and to his credit, or rather his profoundly large cast and crew’s credit, the craft is certainly visible in Warcraft. It feels rude not to compliment the hard work of the makeup, costume, production design, and visual effects teams."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,33,"Definitively establishing that “state-of-the-art” and “chintzy” are not mutually exclusive qualities, Warcraft is a perplexing multiplex boondoggle: Rarely is so much time, money, and cutting-edge technology expended on a spectacle so devoid of wonder."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,30,"In short, Warcraft is the most wearying kind of bad movie, a dull and sad one that's less engaging a watch than just seeing the studio's millions run bill by bill through a shredder for two hours."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,30,"This is not ""Lord of the Rings."" It's barely ""Dungeons & Dragons."""
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,30,"So good at making the most outlandish elements of his first two films seem completely credible, Jones can’t find a way to get this cartoony spectacle to soar. His heartfelt approach to the material only underlines the silliness."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,25,"If you’ve loved the game, you might appreciate the visuals cooked up for this fantasy universe. I was bored out of my skull, pretty much start to finish, from the “Lord of the Rings” opening to the Old Testament/Moses Afloat finale."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,25,"Paula Patton, playing a half-orc, half-human female warrior, is the most sympathetic character and actually gives something approaching a fully fledged performance, but for the rest of it … ugliness as far as the eye can see."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,25,"What's onscreen is a godawful mess, leaving the actors to suck wind while the film collapses around them. If you've never played the game, you might as well watch the movie stoned."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,25,"It’s soulless, incoherent, Renaissance Faire hooey. And since the latest iteration of game series that inspired it, World of Warcraft, already peaked years ago, even the timing is off."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,25,"Watching this bloated mélange of derivative fantasy tropes unfold is akin to being forced to follow the efforts of a particularly ham-fisted gamer, with the viewer being jerked back and forth across countless busy CGI landscapes by a plot that's utterly predictable when it isn't confusing."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,12,"I’m also hoping that the game is more emotionally engaging — or at least, you know, fun — than the movie I just saw. Because that thing was a dour mess."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,12,"It’s all so plodding and grim, echoed by the blandly percussive score by Ramin Djawadi."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,10,"Imagine “Battlefield Earth” without the verve and you get this sludgy, tedious fantasy adventure, a fun-starved dud that’s not even unintentionally hilarious."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,0,"Longtime World of Warcraft players should and likely will storm the cineplex gates, burn the castle down, and salt the earth (and screenwriters) from whence this abomination sprung. Me, I’m going to chill out and download 1982’s top-notch ""The Sword and the Sorcerer."""
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,0,"This is truly a depressing experience. It’s rare to feel such pity for a major studio movie, but watching Warcraft bend over backwards to set up a sequel is like watching a desperate paramedic apply CPR to someone who’s clearly been dead for hours."
Airport 1975,5.6,47285152,63,"Airport 1975 is good, exciting, corny escapism and the kind of movie you would not want to watch as an in-flight film."
Airport 1975,5.6,47285152,63,"The movie does offer its share of thrills and cheesy, unsophisticated fun. Just don't watch it if you're planning any air travel soon."
Airport 1975,5.6,47285152,60,Jack Smight’s direction has the refreshing pace of a filmmaker who knows his plot can crash unless he hurries.
Airport 1975,5.6,47285152,60,"A ridiculous sequel, bad enough to be enjoyable, what with its jumbo jet crammed full of Hollywood celebs - Gloria Swanson, Myrna Loy, Sid Caesar, even Linda Blair (as a teenager being rushed to a kidney transplant) who looks like she is going to vomit over two nuns."
Airport 1975,5.6,47285152,50,"This film, with a whole new cast of miscasts, is even more mindless than its predecessor."
Airport 1975,5.6,47285152,50,"A silly, jumbo-size sequel to the original film adaptation of Arthur Hailey's Airport."
Airport 1975,5.6,47285152,42,"Where to begin with this accidental comic classic, which gives its direct descendant—the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker parody Airplane!, effectively the nail-in-the-coffin of the ’70s disaster movie cycle—some very real competition in the guffaw department?"
First Blood,7.7,47212904,80,"There's the fact that First Blood is a first-rate, taught action thriller."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,80,"First Blood is not the Rambo movie we initially think of when the character is mentioned. No, it’s much better than that."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,80,"Until the last twenty or thirty minutes, however, First Blood is a very good movie, well-paced, and well-acted not only by Stallone (who invests an unlikely character with great authority) but also by Crenna and Brian Dennehy, as the police chief."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,75,"Boasting some of the best use of rugged landscape since the westerns of Anthony Mann, First Blood is an effective, if outlandish, picture that exists merely for its big-screen thrills."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,75,"The darker tone, somber subtext, and generally non-exploitative violence allow viewers to enjoy the film not only as an action/thriller but as something with a degree of intelligence and substance."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,75,"The director, Ted Kotcheff, does a good job with the violence and suspense, working well with the wide-screen format, and he seems fully aware of the dark, subversive implications of the material, even if the screenplay doesn't allow him to resolve them successfully."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,75,"It's a film with a number of strengths, not the least of them its fierce, agile, hollow-eyed hero."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,70,"As a Stallone vehicle this is sleek, slick and not unexciting, but crassly castrates the David Morrell novel on which it is based."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,70,"Director Ted Kotcheff has all sorts of trouble with this mess, aside from credibility. Supposedly, the real villain here is society itself, which invented a debacle like Vietnam and must now deal with its lingering tragedies. But First Blood cops out completely on that one, not even trying to find a solution to Stallone's problems."
Killers,5.4,47059963,55,"It’s so ineffectual and unfocused that after it’s over, you’re not even sure you watched a movie."
Killers,5.4,47059963,40,"Somehow Kutcher and Heigl and Tom Selleck and Catherine O'Hara (as her parents) are all fun to watch a fair amount of the time, without the movie they're in being any good at all."
Killers,5.4,47059963,40,"Kutcher is surprisingly anticharismatic as a star. A smarmy grin and looking good while shirtless does not equal screen presence, dude."
Killers,5.4,47059963,38,There’s nobody delivering the laughs in this arid action comedy.
Killers,5.4,47059963,38,"Killers is dead on arrival: miscast, horribly paced and murderously uninvolving."
Killers,5.4,47059963,30,"Bob DeRosa and Ted Griffin wrote the script, whose plummeting one-liners leave no actor unscathed."
Killers,5.4,47059963,30,Take what pleasure you can from the two stars. They look great; it's just the state of romantic comedy that looks terminal.
Killers,5.4,47059963,30,Dreary romcom-with-guns.
Killers,5.4,47059963,25,The steady drip-drip-drip of nothings like this are killing us all.
Killers,5.4,47059963,25,"Killers isn’t an entertainment, it’s a high-speed spat."
Killers,5.4,47059963,25,"Just as I was beginning to hope that she’d (Heigl) find a part that called for intelligence and sophistication and backbone, she plays another uptight naif."
Killers,5.4,47059963,25,Haven't we seen the oh-my-gosh-my-spouse-is-secretly-an-assassin-but-you-know-a-nice-one routine once too often?
Killers,5.4,47059963,25,"At a certain point, it actually becomes embarrassing to watch Heigl and Kutcher play at being in love."
Killers,5.4,47059963,25,"So here’s an idea: Maybe filmmakers should shoot what Ashton’s up to off-camera, because not many laughs are making it to the screen."
Killers,5.4,47059963,20,"An action comedy that nearly renders the term an oxymoron, Killers is devoid of suspense and laughs."
Killers,5.4,47059963,20,"Robert Luketic's bland action comedy focuses on the uninteresting relationship between its two bland main characters, and that's the deadliest thing in sight."
Killers,5.4,47059963,20,"After this bomb, Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher may qualify as two of the most attractive and prematurely washed-up screen actors Hollywood has ever produced."
Killers,5.4,47059963,20,"Only the underplaying Selleck gets out of this with any dignity, while O’Hara is totally wasted as Jen’s one-note tippling mom."
Killers,5.4,47059963,16,"Everybody's cyber-pal Ashton Kutcher is perfect casting for Killers, since the screenplay is shallow as a Tweet and the movie appears to have been shot with a Nikon point-and-click camera he plugs on  TV."
Killers,5.4,47059963,10,"Bullets fly and jokes land with a thud in Killers, a deadly dull hubby's-a-hit man farce that alternately resembles a knockoff of 2005's ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" and a rehash of ""Knight & Day"" avant la lettre ."
Killers,5.4,47059963,10,"Unless you’re trapped on an airplane or enjoying movie night at the penitentiary, you have no excuse for watching Killers. A brain-deadening collision of high concept and low standards."
Killers,5.4,47059963,10,"Is it some monstrosity of awfulness, as its lack of advance screening suggested? No, that would imply at least a spark of some kind. This is just an empty summer hodgepodge of stale romantic comedy exchanges, witlessness and lackluster action."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,80,"Shooter is a generically titled studio action picture that turns out to be a surprisingly deft satire about Americans' loss of faith in their government following the 2000 election, the 9/11 attacks, and the ensuing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,75,"Shooter does what any good thriller should accomplish - it thrills. It's fast-paced, energetic, and doesn't follow a path that seems pre-ordained from the beginning."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,75,"Wahlberg acquits himself well, and the supporting cast -- which includes pioneering rocker Levon Helm in a scene-stealing cameo as an aging gun buff who knows a thing or two about cover-ups, Ned Beatty as a corrupt politician, and a Strangelovian Rade Serbedzija -- is so strong you almost wish the film were longer so they could have more screen time."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,75,"The movie's politics may miss their mark, but its thrills are dead-on."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,75,"Unravels a bit heading toward its finale, as buildings explode and characters are forced to explain themselves and their nefarious motives. But the payoff at the end - at once kind of radical and gratuitous - delivers a wallop."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,70,"It's a story that can be transplanted from genre to genre, because we never grow tired of it, which is to say that it fits snugly into the paranoid drift of American movies, and the value we place on one honest man with a gun."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,70,"If the movie only lavished as much thought and care on its characters as it does on each intricate set piece, Shooter might have been a classic."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,70,"Carrying Shooter through its difficulties is, finally, not its crisp action sequences and definitely not the torture. It's Wahlberg's performance, which is the film's most old-fashioned element, and its best."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,70,"This maximalist approach can tax the nerves, though it has the benefit of keeping you on alert. It’s also pretty enjoyable. Mr. Fuqua, who happens to be surprisingly good with actors, does have a knack for chaos."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,70,"Wahlberg could be the actor that action movies have been looking for since Sly, Arnold, Harrison, Bruce, Jackie and Jean-Claude -- all in their 50s or 60s -- got too old to execute the leg lifts necessary to kick bad guys in the butt."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,67,"The timing couldn't be better for a thriller that focuses on assassination, international war scandals and U.S. agencies of enormous influence and wildly varying competence."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,63,"Suspended over a deep gully of disbelief, where logic takes more bullets than the bad guys, Shooter still makes the grade as hard-ass action escapism."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,63,"It does move along at a nice clip, and delivers exactly what belligerent action fans on both sides of the political aisle want -- a wholly admirable figure blowing up a lot of bad s---."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,63,"The paranoia is as thick and luscious as that Reddi-wip, and it's served from both left and right."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,63,A stylish but essentially businesslike smash-and-crasher.
Double Target,7.2,47003582,63,"Like most modern action films, Shooter is too explicit, more interested in mayhem than motive."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,60,"An immediately involving yarn of an ace Marine sharpshooter set up to take the fall for an attempted presidential assassination, picture saddles itself with stereotypical villains, hokey contrivances and too-expedient crisis solutions."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,60,The picture might be entertaining if it didn't take itself so seriously.
Double Target,7.2,47003582,58,"The film has about five endings, each sillier than the next. Before it's over, the business end of that sniper rifle looks kind of inviting."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"A screwy assassination thriller for these murky times, it takes half its pages from Soldier of Fortune and the other half from links provided by conspiracytheories-zapoppin.org."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"Despite gripping chase sequences and a few awe-inspiring fiery explosions, gaping holes in the convoluted plot make Shooter heavier on style than substance."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"The story is often ridiculous, but director Antoine Fuqua provides plenty of fun distractions."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"Starts out OK, but then almost seems to be intentionally going for humor."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"If this were a more serious film, its cynicism about the U.S. government would put it in a league with ""The Manchurian Candidate."" But it is simply an Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick with bantamweight Wahlberg doing the heavy lifting for the preoccupied Governator."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"An intermittently preposterous, drawn-out but sometimes entertaining story about an unstoppable ex-Marine."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"Though much of the action in Shooter is beautifully photographed, the movie's force is as a blunt instrument of metaphor. Shooter is a video-game-fantasy version of the 2006 midterm elections, a howl of rage at the hypocrisy of the Bush presidency and the Iraq war."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"This is the first big-studio action picture with some of the disgusted, bloody nihilism of the post-Vietnam era."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,A virtual textbook of action clichés.
Double Target,7.2,47003582,42,"The ultimate crime of this paranoid enemy-of-the-state pulp, directed with more style than brains by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day), is how dull it is."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,42,"Fuqua keeps the action moving efficiently, but he doesn't know when to stop piling it on, and eventually, Wahlberg's army of one becomes more a comic-book vigilante than a righteously disgruntled patriot."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,40,"Sylvester Stallone is filming a new episode of his ""Rambo"" action series, but Mark Wahlberg has beaten him to the punch with Shooter, a preposterous gut buster that follows the formula so closely it would probably lose a plagiarism suit."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,25,"Less subversive and infinitely less intelligent than 1999’s Wahlberg-starrer ""Three Kings,"" this movie does blow lots of s--- up real good and punish contemptible public figures otherwise left unaccountable for massacring African villagers."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"Sicario works on every level. It’s also fairly prescient, coming at a time when America rages on about the ethics of border control and the mounting war on drugs."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"Pulled from the news but punched up to fever pitch, Sicario represents the perfect mix of cerebral and visceral thrills. Star, director and screenwriter all bring their A-game."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"Sicario is a tentacled drug cartel thriller grabbing viewers by the throat and squeezing for two hours. This movie continually defies the conventions of its genre, from its hero's gender to the vagueness of its morality."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"A beautifully murky, hard-edged thriller. Quite simply, one of the best films of the year."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"It’s an unusual mix of big-picture issues, grindhouse pulp and pure, rough entertainment, bolstered by one of the better ensemble casts of the year. This movie is not, um, fussing around."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"It’s an uncommonly bold gambit, expressly designed to frustrate people who want to see a strong woman deliver a righteous ass kicking. The progressivism here is instead rooted in futility and despair, which provides much more of a valuable shock to the system."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"With a taut and timely screenplay by Taylor Sheridan, Sicario is a brilliant action thriller with the smarts of a message movie."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"The opening of Sicario unfolds at such an anxiety-inducing pitch that it seems impossible for Villeneuve to sustain it, let alone build on it, but somehow he manages to do just that. He’s a master of the kind of creeping tension that coils around the audience like a snake suffocating its prey."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"The violence of the inter-American drug trade has served as the backdrop for any number of films for more than three decades, but few have been as powerful and superbly made as Sicario."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,91,"The violence is shocking, effective and soaked into the dry brown landscape."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,90,"By turns thrilling, disorienting and draining, Sicario exists in a border zone seemingly of its own devising between the art film and the action movie."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,90,"What keeps Sicario from cynicism is the nature and depth of Villeneuve’s gaze, not childishly wide-eyed but capable still of feeling pain. He’s a terrific director. You know that if his heroine, Alice, gets out of Cartel-land alive, she might spend a few months in an asylum, but she’ll be back, hell-bent on seizing the foreground."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,90,"Sicario is an ambush, a low-slung  film about a dirty drugs war with Mexico which challenges and engages in equal measure. It moves with grim tenacity, confounding expectations until its very final sequence."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,88,"Far from being just another crime story, Sicario is cinema at its most ambitious."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,88,"Sicario is a conventionally unconventional drug wars thriller, a well-cast, breathlessly executed peek into the heart of a Trumpian nightmare of Mexican cartels which kill at will on either side of an embattled border."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,88,"So much of Sicario, Denis Villeneuve’s disturbing drama set in the world of law enforcement and Mexican drug cartels (the title is the Mexican term for a hit man), takes place on Emily Blunt’s face."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,88,"Those who go to a Villeneuve production, Sicario included, must be prepared for intense suspense, moral ambiguity, and an ending that doesn't conform to Hollywood norms."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,88,"The sound never loses its urgency, its sense of immediate danger, straight through to the closing shot of the film."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,88,"Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies) once again proves he can craft a gripping tale that never collapses under its own moral weight. Sicario is not an easy film to watch, but it is a riveting and essential one."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,88,"Sicario, which combines dizzying action scenes with a taut script, ravishing photography and an otherwordly musical score, is a knockout."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,88,"In Spanish, ""sicario"" means ""hitman."" In film terms, Sicario is sensational, the most gripping and tension-packed spin through America's covert War on Drugs since Steven Soderbergh's Traffic 15 years ago."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,85,"Sicario calls to mind the films of the 1970s — not necessarily the ones we think of as capital-I Important, but the seamy, sweaty thrillers that subtly slipped in anti-establishmentarian messages amid the violence. It mixes arthouse and grindhouse into a most satisfying cocktail."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,83,"Sicario starts and ends with Blunt’s impassioned performance (and she's spectacular in her final scene), but it’s Del Toro who is the real standout."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"Even at its most comprehensible, there’s a lot Sicario deliberately leaves unsaid, and it builds to a crescendo of mayhem and moral rot worthy of a great film noir."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"The acting, craft, and tone of Sicario are so precise that the absurdity of this cartel yarn is both its greatest weakness, and maybe its entire point."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"There are no winners here. Maybe that’s cynical, or maybe it’s true. But it’s a bleak and sometimes powerful message that Villeneuve delivers with blunt force."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"Rather than a birds’-eye procedural about a complex international mission, it’s a close-up of that mission from the point of view of the participant who understands it the least."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"This dramatic thriller finds a spot somewhere between your brain and your stomach, and drills in."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"Sicario is a queasy-making thrill ride through Dick Cheney’s Theme Park on the Dark Side, with an enjoyable cast headed by Blunt, Josh Brolin as a bro-tastic but oddly sinister secret agent in flip-flops and Benicio Del Toro as a person of uncertain provenance (is he Mexican? Is he Colombian? Is he CIA?) who is approximately the scariest guy ever."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"If Sicario does not collapse under its own grimness, that is because of the pulse: the care with which Villeneuve keeps the story beating, like a drum, as he steadies himself for the next set piece."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"Each set piece is orchestrated with aplomb - a raid on a tunnel under the border being a particular stand out - but Sicario is kept grounded in reality. Villeneuve keeps his focus tight on his small group of characters and though the plot is complex, it fits the Byzantine intricacies of the problem and the obscure motivations of the operators."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"Blunt’s performance has an edge of steel. She brings off a mix of confidence, bewilderment and vulnerability, which functions very well against the alpha male characters higher up the chain of command."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,78,Sicario is at its best when its borderlines are fluid and indistinct.
Sicario,7.6,46889293,75,"It delivers a constant, exhilarating stream of elaborate and exquisitely photographed thrills that ends up largely compensating for the would-be profundity."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,75,"I'm not sure if leavening is the right word, but Brolin, as an enigmatic U.S. agent with a world-weary cynicism and a black-ops vibe, provides at least a dose of (very) dark humor to the proceedings."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,75,"If at any point in Sicario, you feel lost, don’t worry about it. The movie is all about being lost and, in any case, all becomes clear, eventually."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,75,"Every scene of calm, potentially, is trip-wired for an explosion. But for all its chilling tension and horrific imagery, Sicario is also a beautiful movie."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,75,"Sicario doesn't fall apart in its second half, exactly, but it does settle for less than it should."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,75,"At times, Sicario is a deeply satisfying, intense examination of a war with no rules of engagement, driven by a spectacular performance by Benicio Del Toro and typically mesmerizing cinematography from Roger Deakins. At other times, especially in its middle act, Sicario can be frustratingly self-indulgent."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,75,Denis Villeneuve's film views life in the age of the modern-day drug war as an ever-crescendoing existential nightmare.
Sicario,7.6,46889293,75,"Amazing to look at, amazing to listen to, yet just a bit underwhelming to really think about, Sicario Denis Villeneuve's Mexican drug cartel drama is superlatively strong in every conceivable way except story."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,67,"Though Villeneuve magnifies the pervasive dread surrounding the modern drug war, he's better at conveying the thrill of creeping through that battlefield than the complex set of interests sustaining it."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,63,"Making a film with fine performances, adept direction, first-rate photography and a doltish screenplay is like starting a rock band with no drummer. The result may yield satisfying, even memorable moments. But every time you try to build momentum, the project falls apart."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,63,"The dark nihilism of Sicario masks a reliance on easier solutions, ones we’ve been fed by decades of genre films and that feed our need for justice dispensed with violent, vengeful directness. The movie promises to clear the fetid air around the drug wars. In the end it’s just another drug."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,60,"Sicario occasionally seems a little too impressed by its own nihilism. Still, this is an involving, grown-up film from a director whose muscular technique continues to impress: one might call it pulp in the same manner one would a plate of minced meat."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,60,"Mr. Villeneuve, aided by Taylor Sheridan’s lean script, Roger Deakins’s parched cinematography and Johann Johannsson’s slow-moving heart attack of a score, respects the imperatives of genre while trying to avoid the usual clichés. It’s not easy, and he doesn’t entirely succeed."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,60,"Villeneuve's proven he's got a strong punch. The trouble is, he barely aims."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,60,"There’s not much fault to find with Sicario on the level of craft or performances, just its rather sputtering momentum, and the lack of a higher purpose."
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,80,Roger Moore’s third outing as Bond is undoubtedly his best.
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,80,"What The Spy Who Loved Me lacks when it comes to establishing the atmosphere of danger present in some the best Bond movies it makes up in spades in the creation of one apparently-impossible situation for the protagonist after the other, the kind that other entries would have been lucky to include a single example."
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,75,"For the first time in three films, Roger Moore starts to unearth a personality for Bond."
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,75,"Triple X posed an ideal opportunity for the series to rectify its dismissive treatment of women until this point, putting a lady on equal footing with Bond. To its credit, the film does feature a bit of screwball badinage between the two (a clunky bit about female drivers, unfortunately), but it has yet to introduce a single female character who doesn’t want to sleep with our hero."
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,60,"The film moves along at a serviceable clip, but it seems half an hour too long, thanks to the obligatory shoot-'em-up conclusion, filmed on the largest sound-stage in the world, but nevertheless the dullest sequence here."
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,50,It's the submarine barn and Richard Kiel's steel-toothed Jaws you remember from this one; the ostensible hero is just a fleshy blur.
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,50,"Gadgets abound, especially a Lotus sports car that transforms into a submarine. But the scene-stealer is 7'2"" Richard Kiel as Jaws, a shark-eating man with steel teeth."
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,50,"As the Bond series moves deeper into the 1970s, the emphasis moves away from the inventive scripts that made the best Sean Connery films fine examples of the spy genre and toward the kind of feats of daring and visual spectacle that abound in The Spy Who Loved Me."
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,50,The film has its moments - Kiel's indestructible heavy racks up a good score - but the rest is desperately weak.
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,40,"While it never sags as alarmingly as its immediate predecessor, Spy, the 10th film in the series, is at best a tolerable disappointment."
Firefox,5.9,46708276,88,"Clint Eastwood's Firefox is a slick, muscular thriller that combines espionage with science fiction. The movie works like a well-crafted machine, and it's about a well-crafted machine."
Firefox,5.9,46708276,75,"For the more intelligent Eastwood fan, the film offers an interesting exploration of the actor-director's screen persona. Throughout, he experiments with a number of different disguises, finally embracing total dehumanization when he steps into the Firefox, dons the special mind-reading helmet, and becomes one with the sleek, gleaming, high-tech killing machine."
Firefox,5.9,46708276,63,"Firefox is only slightly more suspenseful than it is plausible. It's a James Bond movie without girls, a Superman movie without a sense of humor."
Firefox,5.9,46708276,50,"The simple storyline is quickly grounded by flying chunks of exposition that director/actor Eastwood tries to ignore. Eastwood the director disregards many Cold War possibilities, preferring to dawdle over a first hour that mooches along while Eastwood the actor enjoyably dons various disguises, playing a man who can't act (or so everyone tells him) and is happiest left alone with his gippy nerves."
Firefox,5.9,46708276,40,"An unbelievably long film for so little pay-off. More cowboys, please."
Firefox,5.9,46708276,40,"Firefox is a burn-out. Despite the tense mission being depicted, there’s no suspense, excitement or thrills to be had, and lackadaisical pacing gives viewer plenty of time to ponder the gaping implausibilities."
The Rocketeer,6.4,46704056,78,The Rocketeer is a gung-ho all-American summer flick with the guts not to try and be anything else.
The Rocketeer,6.4,46704056,75,"The movie lacks the wit and self-mocking irony of the Indiana Jones movies, and instead seems like a throwback to the simple-minded, clean-cut sensibility of a less complicated time.  That doesn’t mean The Rocketeer is not entertaining. But adjustments are necessary to enjoy it."
The Rocketeer,6.4,46704056,75,"The Rocketeer may not be perfect, but it's an excellent example of how to adapt a comic book to the screen."
The Rocketeer,6.4,46704056,70,"Newcomer Campbell exhibits the requisite grit and all-American know-how, but the lead role is written with virtually no humor or subtext. Those around him come off to better advantage, notably Dalton as the deliciously smooth, insidious Sinclair; Sorvino and Alan Arkin, with the latter as the Rocketeer’s mentor; Terry O’Quinn as Hughes; and the lovely, voluptuous Connelly."
The Rocketeer,6.4,46704056,60,The Rocketeer is low-octane Steven Spielberg — projected in the right happy direction but lacking the gritty accelerant and around-the-edges humor and humanity of other heavy popcorn-load adventures.
The Rocketeer,6.4,46704056,50,The Rocketeer is mostly an example of pop moviemaking at its most derivative.
The Rocketeer,6.4,46704056,40,"Take an uncharismatic leading man (Bill Campbell), an obviously pre-Oscar Jennifer Connelly, a scene-chewing Timothy Dalton and action that doesn't start until halfway through the film and what you have is one of 1991's more disappointing summer flicks."
The Rocketeer,6.4,46704056,40,"A movie that looks nice and moves along efficiently, but offers little reason for anyone to watch."
Colors,6.7,46616067,90,A solidly crafted depiction of some current big-city horrors and succeeds largely because of the Robert Duvall-Sean Penn teaming as frontline cops.
Colors,6.7,46616067,80,It's an exhilarating sparring match between Duvall's workmanlike fine-tuning and Penn's raw energy. [15 Apr 1988]
Colors,6.7,46616067,80,"A special movie - not just a police thriller, but a movie that has researched gangs and given some thought to what it wants to say about them."
Colors,6.7,46616067,75,"Narrative continuity and momentum have never been among Hopper's strong points, and this time the choppiness of the storytelling diffuses the dramatic impact without offering a shapely mosaic effect (as in [his] previous films) to compensate for it."
Colors,6.7,46616067,75,"The movie lacks a sure sense of purpose and direction, and, watching it, you can't help but feel that Hopper, by stepping back and refusing to assert his own point of view, has on some essential level abdicated his responsibility as a director. [15 Apr 1988]"
Colors,6.7,46616067,75,"Colors has a tentative, ambivalent feel to it--as if Hopper merely considered himself a hired gun who should avoid imposing too personal a vision on the material."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,90,"The picture is almost shamefully entertaining, bold and self-effacing at once: Its intelligence reveals itself as a devilish gleam, not a pompous layer of shellac. Why can't more Hollywood movies be like this one?"
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,70,"Turning ""Zorro"" into a family movie with domestic squabbles and sitcom situations takes some of the luster off the romantic adventure of Old California."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,70,"Bigger, louder and considerably less charming than its predecessor…Still, there are enough crowd-pleasing moments amid the frenetic action."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,70,"Good as it is, The Legend of Zorro would be a hollow feat without leads who are drop-dead-gorgeous movie stars and spectacular clowns."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,67,"Banderas uses all his old wiles in this well-oiled, businesslike, quite clangingly violent sequel to ""The Mask of Zorro."""
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,63,"You must cast aside all rules of our space-time continuum to appreciate a fantasy like this one, though even then you might consider 130 minutes to be too much of a good thing."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,63,"A movie-movie - big, lush and sexy. And formulaic, saddled with more plot than it needs and more ""Spy Kids"" references than it should have, but still . . ."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,63,"Of all things, this movie has the same problem ""Ghostbusters 2"" had, which is this: You can't take bigger-than-life screen types and toss them into everyday, regular-folk situations."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,63,"The family dynamic, paired with a few delicious action scenes, is engaging enough that we hardly notice the fillm's major flaw, a rather flimsy and sometimes jingoistic subplot having to do with California's independence."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,60,"If the series wants to become a franchise, a rethink and new blood will be necessary -- maybe Banderas can get mortally wounded in reel one of The Son Of Zorro, passing on the mask and sword to, say, Gael García Bernal."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,60,"Not as satisfying as the old and unimproved version. In a zealous attempt to broaden its appeal, the Zorro franchise has drifted from the qualities that made the previous film so successful."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,58,"The movie is full of action and stunts, but after the gangbusters opening, it loses steam and imagination very quickly."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,58,"Director Martin Campbell and a quartet of screenwriters dump in everything from the rise of the Confederacy to the development of Weapons of Mass Destruction. What escapes them is the cool, clear line of action that would enable Banderas and Zeta-Jones to flaunt their amorous charms without huffing and puffing and stretch their swashbuckling muscles with dash, not balderdash."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,50,"Feels like a half-hearted shrug of a sequel, an attempt to put a lucrative franchise on life support."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,50,"Cursed with two of the least interesting bad guys in recent memory. While McGivens and Armand are unquestionably villainous, there's nothing about them to cause audiences to hiss. They're boring."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,50,"It's a workmanlike adventure yarn, intermittently reverent to the canon but not very inspired, and it must be said that Banderas is starting to show signs of wear."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,50,"This is a hiss-the-villain, cheer-the-hero kind of movie."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,50,This unnecessary and overlong sequel fails to recapture its predecessor's zing.
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,50,"Two hours of ludicrous action, forced humor and self-conscious romance."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,50,There'll likely be more Z's in the audience than on the screen.
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,50,"A big bloated bore-o. Think of a combination of ""Wild Wild West"" and ""Spy Kids."""
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,50,"Antonio Banderas looks a little older, Catherine Zeta-Jones snares a bigger role, and the powerful charms of both are weighed down by an absurdly plot-heavy script."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,50,"The Legend of Zorro, starring Antonio Banderas as the masked one, made me long to re-watch ""Zorro the Gay Blade,"" the great spoof starring George Hamilton. In that film, the Spanish accents were meant to sound deliberately fake."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,42,"Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are back, as is director Martin Campbell, but the result has the all-too-common feel of an expired equine redundantly abused."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,42,The Legend of Zorro is a Saturday matinee entirely lacking in Saturday-matinee thrills or brevity -- what's passable for the first 80 minutes or so becomes intolerable as the movie ticks past the two-hour mark.
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,40,"Most of Mask's cast and crew return, but they forgot to bring the last film's romantic aura and dry sense of humor with them; Anthony Hopkins is deeply missed. Instead, the picture is beset by typical sequel problems like awkward slapstick and allegedly adorable kid sidekicks."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,40,"The Legend of Zorro commits a lot of movie sins, but one is mortal: It turns the magnificent Elena into a nag."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,38,"Well, it's pretty bad, a long way from the dash and satisfactions of the earlier picture."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,38,"What a waste of talent, time and money. And guess what else? Not only is The Legend of Zorro stupid and boring but -- ta-da! -- it's also really long!"
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,30,"I missed the first half hour of this Zorro adventure, and it's a tribute to the idiot-proof screenplay that I had no trouble following the rest."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,30,"Yet, it's watchable -- not remotely enjoyable, but watchable."
The Legend of Zorro,6,46464023,25,"There are precious few things for a Zorro fan – or a film fan, for that matter – not to loathe about The Legend of Zorro."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,72,"Breaking In is a clever twist not the home invasion genre, with a dynamic lead performance by Gabrielle Union as a mother protecting her family. It’s a crowd-pleasing thriller, good but never quite great, because the story collapses under scrutiny. The film is trying to be clever and yet it relies on big, and obvious gaps in logic, but those flaws probably won't ruin the experience."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,70,"Union, a conquering badass, owns it. The movie walks an intriguing line between strained believability and outright superherodom—a line every action movie walks, of course. But then, most action movies don’t star black women."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,63,"So, yes, the movie’s predictable, and writer Ryan Engle makes a lot of unforced dialogue errors."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,60,"With an overbearing score, Breaking In telegraphs almost everything that happens yet still provides several jolts amid its occasionally questionable twists. While the filmmakers aren’t exerting themselves to deliver anything other than a popcorn-seller, Ms. Union is working hard to keep you watching."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,60,These 88 minutes never drag their heels long enough for us to get hung up on their myriad implausibilities. One of those low-expectation releases that’ll see you right if Infinity War remains sold out.
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,60,"The screenplay by Ryan Engle (“Rampage,” “The Commuter”) squanders its potential for emotional depth, making Breaking In a serviceable, but indistinct product."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,50,"With more than a passing nod to the far classier ""Panic Room,"" this derivative seat-squirmer has a few good moments in spite of Johnny Klimick’s annoying score, its energy powered by the raw determination of its Mother Courage."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,50,"Breaking In is a shallow nod to female empowerment, not the embodiment of it."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,50,The most disappointing part of Reverse Panic Room is how little it exploits its high-concept premise after spending so much time establishing all the particulars of this fortified lake house.
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,50,"The film’s sense of time lacks precision and urgency, and just having characters periodically point out that the clock is ticking doesn’t cut it."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,50,"It’s a fun, pulpy premise, but sadly, the film takes a route that’s too silly to be taken seriously and too tame to be any fun."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,50,"It’s not a bad idea and Union proves more than capable of nailing her Liam Neeson/Bruce Willis moment of save-your-family action stardom, but the movie has trouble sustaining interest even over its brisk 88 minutes."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,50,The disappointment of Breaking In is the wasted potential — there are a few plot setups that could have been further fleshed out or brought back around (why was her father being investigated by the DA?) and Union isn’t given enough opportunity to truly display her charms. This thriller could have really used some room to breathe.
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,50,"If there’s a weakness to the movie, it’s that, despite its gut-level appeal, it doesn’t dazzle us with anything brilliant or unexpected. However, there are some nifty turns here and there, so it’s not entirely mediocre."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,42,"The full force of Union’s performance pushes the film to occasional crowd-pleasing results — give this woman a real action role, and fast — and Shaun’s ability to fight back is the one reliable element of an uneven film."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,40,"Union is committed and convincing, but the script apparently never met a cliche it didn't want to adopt wholesale. This offers some thrills and considerable pace, but never enough narrative force."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,40,"Union is capable of powering the film through, valiantly trying to plug the holes the high-concept plot can’t reach. She’s got that big screen charisma, even though, this time, she’s working with small-screen material."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,40,"Union certainly dedicates herself to all the huffing, running, jumping and emoting, though her efforts never counter Breaking In’s aura of trashiness and disposability."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,38,"There is a familiarity to its characters and story, which doesn’t do much at all in terms of reinventing the genre, but very much meets its own expectations."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,30,"Coasting for as long as it can on the considerable charms of its star, Breaking In is otherwise a work of profound half-assedness, running through the paces of its bare-bones framework with all the verve, energy and invention of a night-watchman winding down the last hour of his shift."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,25,Even on a technical level Breaking In is shockingly inept.
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,25,James McTeigue's Breaking In is the sort of incompetently constructed thriller that gives B movies a bad name.
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,25,"The listless, leaden acting, writing and direction in this breathtakingly stupid bomb-ola defies audiences to stay conscious through its drag-ass 88 minutes."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,25,"If there’s one thing that Hollywood thrillers and the legions of actors who march through them teach us, it’s that faking shock and breath-gulping panic isn’t easy. And hiding boredom, for some actors, is damned near impossible."
It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,7.6,46300000,70,"More than anything, though, It’s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World embodies comic hugeness, for better or for worse. It isn’t the best comedy of all time, but it’s one of the largest and broadest."
It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,7.6,46300000,70,"It's a wonderfully crazy and colorful collection of ""chase"" comedy, so crowded with plot and people that it almost splits the seams of its huge Cinerama packing and its 3-hour-and-12-minute length."
It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,7.6,46300000,70,"Being a picture of extravagant proportions, even its few flaws are king-sized, but the plusses outweigh by far the minuses. It is a throwback to the wild, wacky and wondrous time of the silent screen comedy, a kind of Keystone Kop Kaper with modern conveniences."
It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,7.6,46300000,67,There are enough giddy highs that it’s had a strong cult following ever since its release in 1963.

Black Rain,6.6,46212055,100,"It's risky making an action picture that breaks its violent stride to emphasize the difficulties of living up to preconceived ideas of masculinity. But it's that risk that makes Black Rain distinctive. By refusing to beat its Eastern and Western protagonists into comic-book pulp, the movie pays them, and the audience, a rare compliment."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,90,"In Black Rain, director Ridley Scott and his team pump in so much pyrotechnic razzle-dazzle that the movie becomes a triumph of matter over mind. It's a blast of pure sensation, shallow but scintillating, like a great rock melody, superbly produced, where the music pumps you up even as the lyrics drag you down."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,75,"No matter how well dressed, the movie can’t escape the gravitational pull of formula. Without a convincing subtext, Black Rain is pretty dull fare indeed."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,75,"Black Rain is chock-full of moments, jazzy scenery and snazzy bits of dialogue, and stuffed with steroids. It's big, maybe too big for its shallow notions and commonplace structure. But it is also beautiful and terrible in the same ways that other Scott movies have been eye-filling. With its teeming Asian landscape, its dark kaleidoscopic palette and its heavily layered composition, it's reminiscent of Blade Runner. But this is an atmosphere that needs Sam Spade, not Dirty Harry."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,70,"The story of Black Rain is thin and prefabricated and doesn't stand up to much scrutiny, so Scott distracts us with overwrought visuals."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,63,"At its best, Black Rain has the glitzy quality of an extremely long and clever television commercial. One can't be sure what is being sold, but the eye isn't bored."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,63,"Director Ridley Scott's visual gifts are still evident in Black Rain. But with retread plot and characters, Scott's stylistic flourishes become irritating clutter."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,60,"Ridley Scott directed this 1989 feature, and while there's a lot of his characteristic atmospherics—smoke, fog, neon, yellow light, rain, and squalor—to fill all the dead spaces, he's still a long way from the splendors of Blade Runner. The script by Craig Bolotin and Warren Lewis doesn't give him or Douglas very much to chew on, apart from a lot of unpleasant xenophobia about Japanese gangsters, and the plot never gets far beyond the formulaic and the forgettable, hammered into place by Hans Zimmer's pounding and numbing score."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,60,"The crosscultural action picture might have worked if the filmmakers had come up with a script in which Douglas' character had been rendered weak and confused by being a fish trying to swim in strange waters. But instead he is presented as a traditional action hero dominating everyone in sight. The cultural imperialism of that decision makes for a routine and frequently offensive story full of Asian stereotypes. Director Scott (Blade Runner, Alien) certainly knows how to photograph arresting architecture, but the high-gloss look of Black Rain only intensifies the shortcomings of the pedestrian story."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,50,"Director Ridley Scott's Black Rain belongs to the blunt instrument school of filmmaking. This cop thriller, set largely in Osaka, Japan, is so full of screeching tires, flashing neon and extravagant violence that it's almost physically painful to watch, yet that seems to be the effect the director had in mind. If you smack the audience around enough, you'll be respected for your power."
The Enforcer,6.8,46200000,80,"This is a good move because while I and many others believe in civil liberties, no one likes a cop who goes by the book. Besides, Harry seems to have realized that if you kill the criminals then you never have to bother with prosecuting them. It’s only when people live that Harry gets hassled."
The Enforcer,6.8,46200000,75,"The Enforcer is the best of the Dirty Harry movies at striking a balance between the action and the humor. Sometimes in the previous films we felt uneasy laughing in between the bloodshed, but this time the movie's more thoughtfully constructed and paced."
The Enforcer,6.8,46200000,60,Same old sequel squanderings.
The Enforcer,6.8,46200000,50,The action is reasonably fast and competently photographed. The picture doesn't exactly drag. But it is maggoty with non‐ideas.
The Enforcer,6.8,46200000,50,"The spitball script [from a story by Gail Morgan Hickman and S.W. Schurr] lurches along, stopping periodically for the blood-lettings and assorted running and jumping and chasing stuff."
The Enforcer,6.8,46200000,50,"Improbable as are all the Dirty Harry films, The Enforcer is crammed with action and spilling over with violence. The photography is fine, but the gore is as repugnant as Daly's overacting."
Marked for Death,5.9,46044400,88,Marked For Death offers a very proficient range of bang-and-break antics ending with a neat twist.
Marked for Death,5.9,46044400,75,"The film does manage to provide some fresh thematic punches (and gobs of female nudity for the teen male demographic), and it's clear why Seagal was a popular action star. If only the film was a little flashier, a little edgier and a little more original. Still, it's one of Steven Seagal's finest, if that's saying anything."
Marked for Death,5.9,46044400,70,"Those bothered by crunching violence and plot lapses won't find much here to enjoy, but action fans will find it delivers just about all they want from a film."
Marked for Death,5.9,46044400,63,"As directed by Dwight H. Little, Marked for Death lacks much visual interest or suspense."
Marked for Death,5.9,46044400,60,"Between the gang's patois and Seagal's soft speaking, Marked for Death almost begs for subtitles; the breaking of bones, however, comes through loud and clear."
Marked for Death,5.9,46044400,60,"This dim-witted revenge yarn is the simplest of showcases for Steven Seagal - an extremely compelling action presence with his brutal martial arts fighting style, imposing size and nasty demeanor."
Marked for Death,5.9,46044400,60,"Marked for Death is, even by the xenophobic standards of the recent action genre, uncommonly racist and misogynistic."
Marked for Death,5.9,46044400,50,"An ugly movie, with lousy wardrobe to match."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,75,"Gangster Squad is a gang war drama built on Western conventions, a rootin' tootin', Camel-smokin', whiskey swillin' shoot'em up."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,75,The best thing about Gangster Squad is how they got the 1940s accoutrements right.
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,70,"The cops play things as dirty as the crooks in Gangster Squad, an impressively pulpy underworld-plunger that embellishes on a 1949 showdown between a dedicated team of LAPD officers and Mob-connected Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) for control of the city."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,63,Penn's over-the-top tirades and bullying threats are still there - it's a wild and woolly performance that isn't always as menacing as perhaps the actor intended it to be.
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,63,"Gangster Squad provides a welcome burst of heat and color, even if those qualities are more illusory than real and subject to a fast fade."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,60,"For all the guns and gore, it's as breezy and uncritical as a tale from the True Detective magazine that the cops can't help reading."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,60,"Instead of expanding their sights, Fleischer and Beall narrow them, into a repetitive and increasingly exhausting series of shootouts. By the end, those guns might as well be held by extras, rather than some of the most talented actors of our time."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,60,"Made up of synthetics rather than whole cloth, this lurid concoction superficially gets by thanks to a strong cast and jazzy period detail, but its cartoonish contrivances fail to convince and lack any of the depth, feeling or atmosphere of genre stand-bearers like ""L.A. Confidential."""
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,60,"Typified by Penn's blustery performance, Gangster Squad is sleek, stylish but superficial. Easy on the eye, even easier on the brain, it doesn't last long in the memory."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,60,"Sean Penn's not been this fun since Jeff Spicoli and there's plenty of rip-roaring action, but Gangster Squad proves a minor entry in the annals of LA noir."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,Penn is always entertaining when he's playing characters drunk with depravity. Gangster Squad could use more of him.
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"The irony is worth noting: Back when it was really 1949, Hollywood made noir with teeth; this is nougat with pretensions."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"It's the cinematic equivalent of Bon Jovi's You Give Love a Bad Name: You know in your heart it's a crappy song, and every wince-inducing line is an affront to your intelligence, but hey, it's on the radio, so you turn up the volume and sing along anyway."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,A cartoonish 1940s shoot-'em-up that's impossible to take seriously.
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"Josh Brolin plays the leader of the gangster squad as a kind of dedicated dunce, which is appropriate considering their clumsy antics. Ryan Gosling has more nuance as his right-hand man, but Emma Stone is completely out of her element as a slinky film noir heroine, a walking anachronism."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,In the last five minutes the film shifts gears and offers a tribute to law enforcement. But this tacked-on resolution is as sticky and fake as Sean Penn's make-up job.
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"As a capable imitation of better movies by Martin Scorsese, Brian DePalma and Roman Polanski – it's reasonably successful entertainment."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"Gangster Squad is an almost movie. It's almost terrible. It's almost entertaining. But it's missing the shameless insanity of a wonderfully bad movie, and the particular vision, point of view, and coherence of some very good ones. So it sits there in between - loud, flashy, and unnecessary."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,A triumph of production design but a pretty dull kill-'em-up otherwise.
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"Despite the unrelenting action and the terrific cast, Gangster Squad comes up more scattered than successful."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"It never really comes together in a satisfying way, and given the talent involved, that adds up to a big disappointment."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"To be fair, this tawdry dose of pulp fiction (""inspired by real events"") is not a complete waste of time. It offers the marginal pleasure of an all-star cast slumming their way through a thicket of routine plotting, almost laughable dialogue and the constant blaze of tommy guns."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"Brolin and Gosling are both supposed to be playing World War II veterans who bring their knowledge of battle into the tough turf of the streets, but that's just a concept that the sketchy, half-baked script tosses out there."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,42,"The violence is so indifferently presented that it has no kick; it’s not grim or graphic enough to shock, but it doesn’t rev us up, either. The picture’s various shoot-’em-up sequences are so generically conceived and shot that each one is indistinguishable from the next – by the movie’s end, they may as well all collapse into an exhausted heap."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,42,"Very few will remember it in a few months, which is probably just fine with the folks who made it."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,40,"The period thriller Gangster Squad plays like an untalented 12-year-old's imitation of Brian DePalma's ""The Untouchables."""
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,40,"The soul of the era is missing, and with it any reason to care. In Fleischer's hands, the high-stakes shootouts are as stylish as a GQ spread, but it's nearly impossible to figure out who's zoomin' who."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,40,"Though based partly on actual events, Ruben Fleischer's ludicrous shoot-'em-up plays fast and loose with the facts, and plenty else besides."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,38,"Slick, sick, self-consciously stylish and defiantly shallow, Gangster Squad is one of those movies you can't talk about without invoking other (often better) movies. A lot of movies."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,38,"It begins as energetic, clichéd nonsense and ends as irritating, clichéd nonsense."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,33,"Gangster Squad aims for the pop-operatic intensity of ""The Untouchables,"" but ends up feeling like a savage, simple-minded comic strip."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,30,"Mr. Beall, a former LAPD cop, has written a script so devoid of feeling that the cartoons blur into thin line drawings, while what's been done with the marvelous Ms. Stone - i.e. next to nothing - is downright criminal."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,30,"The proximity of horrible headlines scarcely matters - released on any day of any calendar year, Gangster Squad would be a crime against cinematic sensibility."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,30,"This movie made my ears hurt. Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and James Ellroy could have turned this pulp into insinuating jazz. What's here is a cartoonish bore."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,25,"In lieu of any sharp insight into the period and its notorious figures, the film's brash, ultraviolent encounters instead build a showy exterior with nothing of import left standing."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,25,"Ruben Fleischer's film is a perfect example of Hollywood hypocrisy, something to be ignored diligently."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,25,"His (Fleischer) first feature, ""Zombieland,"" was a half-witty genre parody. This one might be described as genre zombie-ism: the hysterical, brainless animation of dead clichés reduced to purposeless, compulsive killing. Too self-serious to succeed as pastiche, it has no reason for being beyond the parasitic urge to feed on the memories of other, better movies."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,75,"A sly, self-mocking sense of humor is apparent even in Robocop 2's title, which identifies both the film's sequel status and its hero. And what a fantastic nightmare creation Robocop 2 is."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,75,"Everything in the first movie is pretty much redone again. But in this case, the repetition isn't a bad thing. It's par for the coarse. The original had such effortless, classic-trashy appeal, there's little reason to buck the self-made system. It works. It can continue. It does continue."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,63,"This ultraviolent, nihilistic sequel has enough technical dazzle to impress hardware fans, but obviously no one in the Orion front office told filmmakers that less is more."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,63,"I didn't much like RoboCop 2 (the use of that killer child is beneath contempt), but I've gotta hand it to them: It's strange how funny it is, for a movie so bad. Or how bad, for a movie so funny."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,63,"Nastiness in a movie can sometimes be liberating and fun, but the nastiness in RoboCop 2 is no more authentic than its heart."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,60,"Kershner's direction is never more than adequate, and the story seems full of unfulfilled promise and tangled threads. It's also deeply, disturbingly violent in a way which is more manipulative than gory; unlike the original, with its prophetic vision of the future, this sequel seems to spend too much time glorying in the very horrors it has outlined."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,60,"With its desensitizing blood lust, RoboCop 2 contributes yet another ugly note to this already demoralizing season of sadism. If things continue as they have until now, the body count at the movies may reach into the millions."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,50,"Kershner's accomplishment in the first half of RoboCop 2--which offers up the original's mixture of crunching action, dystopian satire and depraved villainy--is the genuine pathos this conflicted tin man evokes. But a curious thing happens to this sequel. It forgets what it's about. In the last third of the movie, the character of RoboCop vanishes behind his visor, the script loses its focus, and the special effects take over."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,50,"If you like to stagger away from a film feeling numb and slightly sick, this one's for you."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,50,"It's difficult to imagine a summer film programmed more cynically than this repugnant sequel. RoboCop 2 is all machine, and it's all vile."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,50,The story wanders all over the place without purpose other than to shock with violence.
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,50,RoboCop 2 is every bit as sadistic as its 1987 predecessor but considerably less effective.
Young Guns,6.9,45661556,80,"Young Guns is best watched in the playful, none-too-serious spirit in which it was made. Though the film concentrates reverentially on its young stars, it also includes good performances from a few grown-ups, notably Terry O'Quinn as a lawyer and Jack Palance as the story's wild-eyed villain."
Young Guns,6.9,45661556,75,"YOUNG GUNS is simply not a very good movie--western or otherwise. Fusco's script provides little character development and muddies the narrative with some unlikely supporting characters. Still, it proved to be popular enough to lead to a television spinoff and a sequel in 1990."
Young Guns,6.9,45661556,75,"The movie is showy without having any noticeably coherent style. Indeed, it might have been possible to enjoy Young Guns as a larky spree if the photogenic stars didn't carry themselves with such a smug, self-congratulatory air. But they behave as if our adoration were their birthright."
Young Guns,6.9,45661556,70,Good idea to cast the brat pack in a Western but this was badly realised and altogether a bit flat.
Young Guns,6.9,45661556,63,"Full of odd notions and interludes, the movie never really comes together, but fitfully suggests a cross between Boys Town and Greaser's Palace."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,75,The Great Wall has significant problems — namely with Damon and sidekick Pedro Pascal's lack of bromantic chemistry — but chief among its rewards is its ability to marry its Eastern and Western sensibilities.
The Great Wall,6,45540830,70,"As pure spectacle, The Great Wall is absolutely dazzling. It may be a studio release, but the constant sense of invention, the go-for-broke intricacy of its battle scenes, feels very much of a piece with Chinese action fantasy flicks."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,70,The absurdity is what makes it such a hoot-and-a-half.
The Great Wall,6,45540830,70,Viewers are in good hands — if they’re not too demanding — as Zhang Yimou puts the easily distinguishable characters through their paces.
The Great Wall,6,45540830,67,"If The Great Wall is too spotty to really satisfy as the old-fashioned medieval adventure it sometimes aspires to be, it is consistently engaging as an almost abstract exercise in visual sumptuousness."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,63,The Great Wall defies any expectations — it’s absolutely bonkers wild.
The Great Wall,6,45540830,63,"This is an often beautiful film, unmistakably the work of a great director but also a clearly compromised one."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,60,"If you calibrate your expectations to “monster movie for eight-year-olds,” you may find some fun in this energetic and blissfully brief (a mere 103 minutes!) tale of the Chinese army battling alien beasties in the Song Dynasty era."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,60,The Great Wall is not exactly a good movie – but it’s a pretty enjoyable one.
The Great Wall,6,45540830,60,"It won’t be remembered as Zhang’s best film, but the director’s artistic touch is on display in his long panoramic sweeps and artful use of colour. Simultaneously futuristic and historic, the visual spectacle carries the film."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,58,"The Great Wall doesn't have the lunacy that made last year's Gods of Egypt a hoot. Zhang can't kick his craving for respectability, even if he's making a movie that flips the middle finger at historicity."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,58,The Hollywood-infused epic fantasy plays like Warcraft meets The Last Samurai by way of Zack Snyder — but shockingly better than all that sounds.
The Great Wall,6,45540830,58,"There is barely a whiff of genuine transcendence in this grand-scale extravaganza. The special effects are courtesy of Industrial Light and Magic, but the magic here is largely industrial."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,58,"The Great Wall looks like it could be a really amazing video game. Alas, it’s a movie, and kind of a brick."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,50,12 year old boys will love the result. That’s not a good sign for anyone who has passed beyond their teenage years.
The Great Wall,6,45540830,50,The Great Wall is a so-so movie with eye-popping images.
The Great Wall,6,45540830,50,Zhang’s apocalyptic view of the beasts from above as they swarm over the palace like rats may be a chilling metaphor for what awaits us all if we don’t achieve effective international co-operation – but it is also the too-hasty climax to an underdeveloped martial-arts/monster-movie mashup. East and West are going to have to do better than this.
The Great Wall,6,45540830,50,"The Great Wall is like the disaster of 47 Ronin all over again, except the action is a bit more fantastically barbaric and Damon isn't all that bad himself."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,50,"For Yimou’s colors alone, and one particularly striking set piece set in a kaleidoscopic stained-glass tower, The Great Wall may be worth the price of admission."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,50,"It may be a second-rate “Lord of the Rings,” but at least it doesn’t overstay its welcome."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,50,"Director Zhang Yimou capably gives period fantasy-action The Great Wall the look and feel of a Hollywood blockbuster, but his signature visual dazzle, his gift for depicting delicate relationships and throbbing passions are trampled by dead-serious epic aspirations."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,42,"Other than the enjoyably silly banter between Damon and Pascal, there are few moments that endear you to anyone on screen. The movie’s tone veers from bombastic to goofy with speed but little grace."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,40,"Its real accomplishment is that, with so much money behind it and a true visionary at the helm, it manages to feel so dated."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,40,"A murky mishmash of a movie, with the lightest smattering of glorious moments."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,40,"The Great Wall flirts with romance and bleats out a little propagandistic blather about the benefits of bilateral action, but the focus throughout remains on multitudes of shifting, surging bodies — human and beast, digital and not — that, as they ebb and flow, resemble a Chinese military pageant and a lavish Busby Berkeley number."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,40,"It sure is handsome-looking, throwing off a majestic gleam. But that’s not the same as possessing actual majesty. There’s barely a minute when The Great Wall doesn’t veer into the trying-too-hard zone, and to watch all that striving is simply exhausting."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,40,"There are plenty of fun CGI monster-skewering scenes, but a clunky plot, rigid script and equally stiff acting make this a crumbling disappointment, if not quite a disaster."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,40,"The characters are ciphers, the narrative is dull and even the sights and sounds become numbingly bombastic after a while."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,38,"It plays like like a video game in which the goal is to kill as many of these green-blooded monsters as you can before time's up. It's fun for about 10 minutes, and then the tedium seeps in."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,38,"The Great Wall crumbles mainly because of its wholly predictable plot, wretched dialogue and dud of a filmgoing experience from noted director Zhang Yimou (House of Flying Daggers)."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,38,We will see worse movies this year than The Great Wall. But we won’t one more cynical.
The Great Wall,6,45540830,38,"The Great Wall is so fantastically misguided and so wonderfully bad, I could see some coming for the action and staying for the camp laughs."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,30,"Whether it’s a case of miscasting is unclear, but without a willing hero to anchor this already dubious movie from start to finish, The Great Wall hits a brick wall."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,30,"You can try to enjoy The Great Wall as a delightfully crappy blockbuster, but when you remember this is a Zhang Yimou film, it’s just a disappointment."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,30,"If ever a film was made with more money than sense, this is it."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,25,"A bad movie by any culture’s standards, The Great Wall mostly goes to show that if the future of the business lies with Hollywood -China alliances, it doesn’t bode well for either side."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,25,"The narrative is clumsy, and the monster scenes are ridiculous, but not ridiculous enough to be funny, just ridiculous enough to be boring."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,20,"While it shows fleeting moments of promise, there's precious little great about The Great Wall. Instead, it should be called ""The Ridiculous Wall."""
The Great Wall,6,45540830,20,"The computer-generated monsters, like the film as a whole, are numbingly repetitive, and devoid of any power to move, scare or stir us."
The Great Wall,6,45540830,20,"From blundered opening to risible conclusion, it’s a wall-to-wall fiasco."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,90,"Though it's made with lots of modern tricks and technology, it's old-fashioned in the best sense, and not just because it's set in the Sixties."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,83,"If you have a fondness for the genre and a particular love of '60s pop, The Man From UNCLE is the summer's big fizzy drink, all bubbles, and while it may be gone the moment you walk out of the theater, the smile it puts on your face will likely linger."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,80,"It succeeds admirably on its own terms – more so, I think, than his two Sherlock Holmes films – and while it never really transcends pastiche, its ambitions don’t lie in that direction."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,80,"U.N.C.L.E. has enough style and smarts to make it an amusingly louche summer movie: a cultivated mix of action and wit, suits and cities, that feels refreshingly analogue in a digital world."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,78,"This new Man from U.N.C.L.E. would be an instant masterpiece if it were consistently as good as its best parts, but even as a hit-and-miss affair, it’s a bracing bit of late-summer fun for anyone who has given up the notion of a major studio offering anything truly revelatory until at least October."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,75,"A celebration of a time when secret agents dressed impeccably, bantered with style, and had exceptionally cool toys. That the movie is almost instantly forgettable is part of the pleasure."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,75,"Director Guy Ritchie, who wasn’t born when the TV show debuted in 1964, cleverly captures the elements that made it a success."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,75,"It has taken Warner Brothers ten years to get this property a new life and, thankfully, the results in no way resemble those of its Cold War TV compatriot. Or, to put it another way, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) is good fun, which ""The Avengers"" (1998) wasn't."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,75,"What really sets The Man From U.N.C.L.E. apart is its refusal to pander to short attention spans. This is a movie whose charm sneaks up on you, like a spy in the night."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,75,"While The Man From U.N.C.L.E. probably isn’t any less of a caricature of its period than ""Sherlock Holmes,"" it carries its fakeness with more snap in its step. The imaginary intrigue it generates is fleeting, but often beautiful."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,75,"The Man from U.N.C.L.E. plays a like a lower key, vintage edition of a “Mission: Impossible” movie. It’s a good movie with a great look."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,70,It turns out to be absolutely delightful.
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,63,"The spectacular Italian locations, jazzy score and vehicular action finally go somewhere in the third act, when Ritchie riffs a few stylistic conventions of the era. Mesmerizing and clever, but more style than substance."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,63,"A lot of energy and effort has gone into this endeavor, and I can't say some of it's not fun. But more of it, alas, is just tedious. Say uncle already."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,63,"Vikander, the sexbot in ""Ex Machina,"" is having a hell of a year. And you can see why. Gaby isn't much of a part, but Vikander makes her a live wire. Her impromptu dance with Kuryakin that ends in a wrestling match is, well, something to see."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,63,"Temperamentally, Guy Ritchie aligns more with the lithe, James Bond-like Solo: detached, above-it-all, eternally cool under pressure."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,60,"The director of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is Guy Ritchie, and there are hints, in the Berlin scenes, that he is tempted by the murkier option. Before long, however, as befits the maker of “Snatch” and “RocknRolla,” he drops the shadowy chic, decamps to Rome, and gets down to silliness."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,60,"It almost works. Actually, it does work, hitting the requisite number of hip notes. It just doesn’t dazzle, and that’s kind of a surprise."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,60,"Mr. Ritchie tends to flaunt his wares like a store clerk, fawning over the clothes, chairs and cars, and his usual rabbity pace slows to a tortoiselike crawl whenever the actors deliver a lot of words, which gratefully isn’t often. His talent, as he proves repeatedly, is making bodies and cars crash through space."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,60,"It's a good-looking film and the three leads hold our attention, yet the lacklustre plotting and lack of narrative drive undercut The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'s overall charm."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,60,"Cavill and Hammer are made for each other, but the film can’t always find the pyrotechnics to match their chemistry."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,60,"While it lacks a memorable villain, and the central pairing fizzes but never sparks, the film gets by on its vintage charm and a third act upswing."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,60,"The film is nothing but a sensuous rush of snappy period costumes, elegant beauties, dapper men, kinetic action and so-so quips, and because Ritchie seems even less concerned with story than usual, that blinkered approach very nearly works."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,60,"Cavill and Hammer have each toplined major tentpoles before, so it’s something of a mystery why neither makes much of an impression here, but there’s a curious vacuum at the center of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. that almost certainly owes to its casting."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,58,"Stylish to a fault and straying from the source, Guy Ritchie's The Man From U.N.C.L.E. revives a 1960s television hit for the short attention spans of today's youth-skewing movie audience."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,58,"Ritchie manages a promising first act. But at the whim of the action movie formula, and ostensibly nothing else, priorities shift as the story carries forward. When we’re asked later on to attend to escalating stakes and a dimming tone, we’re simply left wondering what happened to all the fun."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,50,"While Mission: Impossible has found a popular way to reimagine an old show for modern times, Man is immersed in all things retro — from the ginchy fashion to a jazzy score — but for an action adventure, it’s a mostly tedious affair with fleeting moments of cool."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,50,"Ritchie is a director with no instinct for the audience, and he can’t hold things together for an entire film. He seems at a loss, from moment to moment, as to what he should emphasize."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,50,"The period spy thriller The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is only intermittently engaging and amusing, and those portions of the movie that succeed are also frustrating. Because they’re cushioned by enervated, conceptually befuddled, and sometimes outright indifferent stuff."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,50,It’s not so much bad as dull and ill-conceived. It doesn’t so much end as sputter out.
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,50,"How is that Vikander, who played the robot in the recent (and worthwhile) ""Ex Machina,"" was twice as lively and five times as human in that picture than in The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?"
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,50,"It's got a few things going for it and it's not unenjoyable to sit through, but, at the same time, the tone and creative register never feel confident and settled. It's not bad but not quite good enough either."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,42,"Looks great, sounds great -- what's the problem? Everything else."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,42,"The early-’60s styles are chic, the Euro locales are swank, and the music cues (including a nod to Ennio Morricone’s Once Upon a Time in the West score) are fantastic. Too bad the plot and the lead performances are so lifeless."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,40,"Being a mildly pleasant, passingly amusing light entertainment isn't exactly saving the world, yet the film crosses its wires to blow up even that modest assignment."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,40,"There’s some nice early-60s period production design and the whole thing moves along smoothly, if unhurriedly. But it never delivers anything like the punch of Tom Cruise’s M:I adventures, nor the wit and distinctiveness of 007."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,38,"Armie Hammer has given several of the worst performances in recent years — see, or rather don’t, “Mirror Mirror” and “J. Edgar.” The big surprise in The Man from U.N.C.L.E is that Henry Cavill is even worse."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,30,"The chemistry between the leads is nonexistent. Cavill unsuccessfully tries to channel Cary Grant, while Hammer’s Kuryakin has so much inner conflict, it becomes a joke that isn’t funny."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,25,The threat that this mess of a movie might be followed by a sequel is enough to make anyone cry uncle.
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,20,"It’s slow, lethargic, utterly lacking in charm and undeserving of the Cold War setting that is its best trait."
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,100,"Aldrich was a master at presenting his distinctly cynical outlook in the context of crowd-pleasing entertainment, and The Dirty Dozen is one of his most effective and lasting efforts."
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,80,Unarguably one of the great war movies of all time.
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,80,"Aldrich appears to be against everything: anti-military, anti-Establishment, anti-women, anti-religion, anti-culture, anti-life. Overriding such nihilism is the super-crudity of Aldrich's energy and his humour, sufficiently cynical to suggest that the whole thing is a game anyway, a spectacle that demands an audience."
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,80,Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson in the same picture. How much more bad-assedness do you need?
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,80,"Lee Marvin heads a very strong, nearly all-male cast in an excellent performance."
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,80,"Director Robert Aldrich gets convincingly raw, tough performances in even the smallest roles."
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,75,"There are some nice, amusing scenes, especially when one of the dozen (Donald Sutherland) pretends to be a general and inspects some troops. In fact, right up to the last scene the movie is amusing, well paced, intelligent."
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,75,"The Dirty Dozen flows nicely, keeping things moving and drawing the audience along in its rapid current"
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,75,Robert Aldrich dissects the underlying ideas with just enough craft and thoughtfulness to make the implications of this gritty 1966 war drama unsettling in not entirely constructive ways.
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,60,"It is overlong, uneven and frequently obscure, but will succeed by virtue of its sustained action, even though what it attempts to say, if anything, remains elusive."
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,50,"Sadistic, anti-Nazi slaughter mission. Entertaining as a blowtorch."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,63,"When the comedy connects, it can deliver with funny force"
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,63,"Once it gets going and commits to its time-worn inspirational formula, it's not half-bad."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,60,"Knuckleheaded though this faculty-member-turned-MMA-fighter comedy is, there's no denying the plot's lefty credentials, snuck in like Raisinets among the popcorn."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,60,"Like James in the ring, it doesn't pack a lot of power, but it comes out swinging and sweats for applause."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,"So even if Here Comes the Boom doesn't quite work as a comedy (it's not particularly funny), or a drama (it's not particularly poignant), it has an earnest charm that keeps us engaged."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,Here Comes the Boom is stale and vanilla. We know we're in trouble early when the first joke fails.
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,"If you can choke down the implausible notion that the doughy Kevin James would last more than five seconds in a mixed martial arts ring, Here Comes the Boom is a moderately enjoyable, nontaxing sort of comedy."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,"A farther-fetched fantasy: In addition to asking we believe our loosely packed academic can play Rocky, Here Comes the Boom imagines a world in which butterball Everyman Scott and the fabulously lush Bella (Salma Hayek) might argue and bill and coo and eventually fall in love."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,What's missing from this color-by-numbers screenplay is the bizarre touch of eccentric humor Sandler often lets creep into his comedies.
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,"The pure mechanics of Here Comes the Boom land it in an enjoyable, if forgettable, space."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,"It's all harmless, if not entirely fun."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,"Kevin James's latest comedy doesn't promise any bing or bang, only boom. Take it at its word."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,"A cloddish, harmlessly drecky comedy from the Sandler factory of crude mush."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,42,Cue 105 painful minutes of a fat guy getting punched in the face and falling down.
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,40,"Few people will be surprised by how it all unfolds or by how it all ends. This is a movie about lightweight entertainment and heavyweight fighters, not a movie about surprises."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,40,"The film works hard at its inoffensiveness. Throughout, jokes are left on the table, setups never pay off in any significant way."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,40,"Boom was produced under the auspices of pal Adam Sandler's Happy Madison Productions, which has a tendency toward broad-comic morality tales and multiplex populism that often shades into remedial-level pandering."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,40,"All banality, though it delivers some goodwill even as it pulls a muscle trying to get its premise going."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,40,The first half hour of Here Comes the Boom is so good moviegoers might be fooled into expecting something better than an obvious wish fulfillment fantasy so patently implausible it's almost insulting.
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,40,"Hands of stone meet heads of air in Here Comes the Boom, a sports story so daffy it may as well star Kevin James."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,40,Low on raunch but even lower on laughs. It also looks like half the lighting crew failed to show up.
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,38,"Loud, incoherent and unfunny, Here Comes the Boom is the sound of American culture imploding."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,38,"Here Comes The Boom seems to have made it from the pitch stage - Kevin James does MMA to save his school or something! - to the big screen without an iota of inspiration, ambition, or personality seeping in at any juncture."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,33,"""Here Comes the Bomb"" would've been a more fitting title, but props to Henry Winkler for rising to the occasion and turning in a sweet, idealistic performance in a film that otherwise feels like a tawdry commercial for the UFC and MMA."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,20,"As a comedy, the film aims low and manages to miss the mark entirely."
Convoy,6.3,45000000,70,"The narrative goes a bit over the top in the second half, but it's after a large dose of the best kind of escapist good humour."
Convoy,6.3,45000000,70,"Convoy has one huge advantage over the song that inspired it: It’s one thing to hear about a mighty convoy, but it’s quite another to see it. There’s a certain tacky, truck-stop grandeur to witnessing so many huge vehicles traveling together like a pack of steel, gasoline-fueled animals."
Convoy,6.3,45000000,70,"At its best, the film finds Peckinpah moving into a new poetry of non-violence, of movement associated with explicit, actualized harmony, but the director doesn’t trust himself, mistaking change of form for impersonal commercial stewardship."
Convoy,6.3,45000000,63,"It looks like a potboiler: only a few of Peckinpah's themes are present, and they're mostly left undeveloped. But Peckinpah can still stage a fight scene better than anyone, and the film establishes its own crazy rhythm as it runs off wildly through most of the southwest."
Convoy,6.3,45000000,63,"A noisy but enjoyable destruction derby of a film, sadly with none of the subtlety, invention or skill of Spielberg's Duel."
Convoy,6.3,45000000,60,"Sam Peckinpah’s Convoy starts out as Smokey and the Bandit, segues into either Moby Dick or Les Miserables, and ends in the usual script confusion and disarray, the whole stew peppered with the vulgar excess of random truck crashes and miscellaneous destruction."
Convoy,6.3,45000000,50,"The movie is a big, costly, phony exercise in myth‐making, machismo, romance-of-the-open-road nonsense and incredible self‐indulgence."
Convoy,6.3,45000000,50,"Kristofferson's performance is as monotone as his singing, showing few changes in dramatic emphasis. Unmotivated story riddled with confusion and disarray."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,75,"Quibbles dissipate in the face of the giddiness of the action, which builds to such a relentless head that even the serious stakes of the film’s motivation give way to a largely pleasant vibe."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,70,"It may be messy, but the parts that matter go for broke with breakneck ambition."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,67,"It’s fun and mostly inoffensive, never taking itself too seriously while it rewards its inexplicable fans. Better still, it makes every effort to borrow from the Fast series’ latter-day push for more diverse heroes, something the action genre needs right now."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,63,"Speaking strictly for myself, Vin Diesel, here coming back to play Xander Cage, the James Bond of skateboarding character he originated in 2002’s “XXX” is the least exciting component of this 3D slam-bang fest."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,63,"Pure spectacle has since been subsumed into narrative filmmaking, but the cinema of attractions is always present, especially in modern action movies, and there may be no greater current example of this than xXx: The Return of Xander Cage."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,60,"We've seen all these stunts pulled before, and seen them done better, but there's some pleasure to be had here — even if it's of the extremely guilty kind."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,60,"Vin, great ridiculous beefcake lunk that he is, does provide us with some fun."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,58,"One should applaud Diesel and Caruso for breathing unexpected energy into what could’ve been another lame, uninspired continuation. It’s wild, loud and totally out of control, and that’s periodically a pretty good thing."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,50,"While he has a decent enough handle on the right tone for the proceedings, Caruso’s action sequences are slapdash to the point of incoherence."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,50,"A shift in tone to something like ""Kingsman"" might have made this a more entertaining experience."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,50,A reasonably entertaining popcorn movie experience.
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,50,"The essential question here, of course, is how kickass those action scenes are, since no one’s watching an xXx movie for the plot. (That particular assumption may explain how loose the continuity remains throughout.) The answer is variable."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,50,"It goes without saying that the American public’s relationship to the NSA has changed dramatically since the first xXx movie in 2002 – a sea change that this film seeks to play up – but the script, written by F. Scott Frazier, doesn’t quite know what to do with its critique of the NSA’s unchecked power."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,50,"Rarely do five minutes elapse between some sort of laugh-out-loud absurdity, and the distinction between the film’s intentional and unintentional comedy grows hazier as it goes."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,40,Collette – usually a delight – sounds like she’s phonetically speaking a foreign language. Not even Judi Dench could sell these lines.
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,40,"Diesel is the star (as well as a producer), in every scene. And he drags the film down with him."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,40,The film is packed with moments of rank idiocy.
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,40,"The movie wastes chance after chance to pull together a satisfying action sequence, or give us anything to look at that’s not lame, spatially confusing, and badly lit."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,40,"Somewhat impressively, it’s even stupider than this outlandish synopsis sounds, with action that makes the F&F movies look grounded, “hip” dialogue that induces spasms of embarrassment and a shockingly casual disregard for human life."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,38,Return of Xander Cage adds up to a movie “all jacked up on Red Bull and Mountain Dew.” And we all know how bad that stuff is for you.
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,30,"Characters are simply triggers for the overwrought action sequences, though between the Edward Scissorhands editing and occasional wobbling background, even those are less than distinct."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,25,"Even in the weak signal that is the January movie season, xXx: The Return of Xander Cage hardly registers."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,25,Diesel has chosen to keep selling stupid to audiences who are inexplicably eager to gobble it up. Damn shame.
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,25,xXx: Return of Xander Cage is the movie equivalent of cotton candy: all empty calories. Excessive consumption of this product is likely to give a body the queasies.
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,12,"I should put in for worker’s comp for the extensive injuries I sustained watching the insulting, abysmal 3-D action thriller xXx: Return of Xander Cage, which  left me deeply traumatized and suffering from injuries to my eardrums, my eyes, my mind, my soul, my aesthetic sensibility, and my sense of decency."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,60,"A movie that makes little sense, is dumb when it's not being stupid and yet is still at times laugh-out-loud funny."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,60,"There is enough ridiculous fun in the Tracy Morgan- Bruce Willis pairing as two of Brooklyn's ""finest"" to get many of you past the squirm-inducing stuff."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,60,"Working with a full-on studio budget for the first time in his decade-and-a-half career, Smith is still making movies about guys just like him."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,50,"While the plot is as flimsy as a hooker's halter top, it's buoyed by two actors with attitude and timing."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,50,Cop Out seems aptly named. It’s not personal. It’s barely even a movie. It’s a fire hydrant that the director and his stars use for exterior shots.
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,50,You want to cut Cop Out some slack because it's just so darn eager to please. So let's grant that it will make a reliably fun companion when it's on cable 10 times a week.
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,50,"Has its moments, it's also regrettably ordinary."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,50,"If you're like me, diluted Smith is still better than no Smith at all."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,50,"Okay, there are worse movies out there, but I'm hard-pressed to figure out why I'd waste my time and money watching something that's a half-baked retread of better movies I can stream from Netflix."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,50,"Morgan transcends the wayward silliness of Cop Out just by going for the gusto. He grabs it, and he hangs on."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,50,"Definitely has its amusing moments, but ultimately all that improvised shtick gets mighty tired without any real break in the nonaction."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,42,"Without that heightened racial antipathy-turned-camaraderie, there's not a whole lot to Cop Out besides watching Kevin Smith pretend, with a crudeness that is simply boring, that he's an action director making a comic thriller about cops versus a Mexican drug gang (yawn)."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,40,"Flat and unfunny, this merits a second star based entirely on Scott’s cameo. Kev, get thee to a typewriter. You’re so much better than this."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,40,"There's precious little of that tension to be found between co-leads Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan, but more than enough between director Kevin Smith and the shoddy script he's elected to take on, and neither seems willing to budge."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,40,"An ultra-thin spliff, Cop Out never sparks, although knowing that in advance won’t deter moviegoers who believe pairing Morgan & Willis with Smith equals hilarity."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,38,"A lot of the dialogue is intended as funny, but man, is it lame."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,38,"Director Kevin Smith's tweets, jokes and sharp commentary after being denied a seat aboard a Southwest Airlines flight because of his girth were a lot more engaging than Cop Out, his new movie."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,38,It's a performance in search of a movie.
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,38,Repeatedly shoots for laughs -- but ends up mostly firing blanks.
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,38,Cop Out is still funnier than the dreadful later Eddie Murphy cop pictures. But it feels like an homage to a period best forgotten.
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,33,"With Cop Out, Smith works from a script other than his own for the first time--this one penned by siblings Mark and Robb Cullen--but his slack direction siphons the energy out of this tongue-in-cheek throwback to ’80s mismatched-buddy comedies."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,33,"There are a few hilarious bits, but even those are drowned out by constant gunfire and Morgan’s motormouthing. Willis is going through the motions; Scott is funny, if irritating; Morgan is irritating and not so funny."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,30,"It’s a phoned-in, gutless piece of hack work that reminds you of other, better films in the same vein."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,30,"Sluggish, formulaic."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,30,"An equally tired and wearisome buddy-cop movie that might as well be a forgotten leftover from the era of ""Turner and Hooch."" Now there's a film with classic Kevin Smith scrawled all over it."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,25,"A buddy cop film in which one of the cops continually quotes dialogue espoused by fictional cops, in everything from ""Heat"" to ""RoboCop,"" and not once is it funny."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,25,"A soulless, witless, landfill contraption that Smith once would have mocked mercilessly."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,25,"When your movie is nothing more than a cheap and uninteresting homage, best not to call attention to that fact with a ten minute opening scene to that effect."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,25,"Represents his (Smith) first act of cinematic cynicism, his first crime against his own talent. With this action comedy, he has given us 110 worthless minutes, a bad formula movie like every other bad formula movie."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,25,Fails as a comedy-drama because it’s neither funny nor involving. But it fails as a buddy movie because Willis and Morgan make for a dull couple.
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,20,"Desperation oozes from every frame of Cop Out, which front-loads its best joke -- then spends the rest of its running time endlessly spinning its wheels."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,10,Tedious to watch and torture to listen to.
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,0,"Nothing to see here, keep moving."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,0,"Cop Out wouldn't be as disappointing if it hadn't been made by Smith, but for those who dig the vulgar wit of his early, funny films, it's not just stupid, it's sad. At least the worst film of the year also bears its most forgettable title."
Cop Out,5.6,44875481,0,"With so much junk littering the screen these days, the movie business looks like a garbage strike, and it’s beginning to smell, too. The latest pollution from the celluloid dumpster is sub-mental horror called Cop Out."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,75,"The desire to go back in time to change things -- or just to visit -- is so central to the experience of being alive and stuck in time that Timecop has a built-in power. It's a power the film, a satisfying science-fiction thriller, takes full advantage of."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,63,"Van Damme once again bends and twists his muscular frame to superhuman excess, but his Belgian tonsils have all the flexibility of the Himalayas when it comes to splurting out his one-liners."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,63,"Years of tireless persistence have begun to work in Mr. Van Damme's favor. It's hard not to enjoy his energy, even if his acting gifts still leave a lot to be desired. The fact is that he looks good, behaves affably and kicks with gusto, which is quite enough to satisfy the demands of Timecop."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,60,"Timecop, a low-rent ""Terminator,"" is the kind of movie that is best not thought about at all, for that way madness lies."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,60,"Van Damme is compelling only when he takes his clothes off, which he doesn't do often enough here."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,50,"The plot is more confusing than clever, and the only actor who seems to be having any fun is Silver, who's at his best throwing masochistic hissy fits at his younger, not-quite-so-evil self."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,50,"As a shoot-'em-up, blast-'em-to-pieces film, it's not half bad. As a futuristic time travel movie, however, it has some very serious problems."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,50,"Timecop is good dumb fun, but it's likely to receive the same sentence most Van Damme projects do: a few weeks in movie theaters and eternity on video store shelves and cable television."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,50,"Initially an amiable sci-fi thriller that toys with the paradoxes inherent in time travel, it finally gets drunk on them. It becomes an incomprehensible stew of versions and revisions, until there's no there there and no then then."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,50,"Even though this is supposed to be a kindlier Van Damme vehicle, his movies couldn't exist without his trademark ability to deliver the kind of accurate, powerful kicks any World Cup team would envy. All his soulful glances notwithstanding, Timecop still depends too much on violence to make it appealing to the uninitiated or the unwary."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,50,"It's dumb, to be sure, but then again, so were most of the old movie cliffhangers, from which Timecop is obviously derived."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,50,"For the most part, Hyams’ lackluster direction and the repetitive quality of the action sequences squander an intriguing premise and impressive production design, leaving few moments that elicit the sort of “Wow!” response such fare needs in order to prosper."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,67,"It's easy to take most films' war-torn elsewheres for granted, and taken on its own merits, Red Dawn is a victory of small battles and heavy artillery, sentimental but rarely too hackneyed, energetic without becoming too silly."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,60,"Despite the considerable impediment of a premise arguably even sillier than that of the original ""Red Dawn,"" helmer Dan Bradley's long-delayed remake of John Milius' 1984 kids-vs.-Commies adventure delivers enough thrilling action sequences and rock-'em, sock-'em fantasy-fulfillment to amp its B.O. potential."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,50,"The best segments of the film occur early, as the setting is established with a dose of ""Friday Night Lights"" normalcy followed by an invasion that recalls ""Independence Day."""
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,50,"Ultimately, the problem with this Red Dawn is the same problem with the first one. Despite the more realistic battle scenes, nothing in it feels more fateful than a football game."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,50,"Thor's Chris Hemsworth leads the pack as a high school football star-turned-Marine, while Josh Peck plays his stubborn younger brother. There's also a collection of junior guerrillas, including The Hunger Games' Josh Hutcherson and Friday Night Lights' Adrianne Palicki. Take that, screaming North Koreans with no agenda!"
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,50,"As a combat action spectacle, the movie takes a straightforward, gritty approach that makes for mostly solid viewing."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,50,Only those with paranoid fantasies of an en masse invasion on American soil will find Red Dawn remotely powerful. The concept should have been updated to allow for more complex and surreptitious kinds of warfare.
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,50,"Many of the original film's booby-trap scenarios are repeated here, but without Milius' grandiosity and nihilism. There's less of both in the new Red Dawn. It's not a disaster. It's just drab."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,50,This version is unlikely to strike a similar chord with young audiences while severely disappointing older fans of the original.
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,42,It's enough to make Kim Jong ill.
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,40,"The doltish, messy and frequently incoherent result bears all the hallmarks of a botched and compromised endeavour."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,40,"While a foreign regime exerting its emergent power over America certainly has a familiar ring to it, if anything, this new Red Dawn is a movie in search of its moment."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,40,"In his debut the director, Dan Bradley, a stunt coordinator with a long list of credits, handles the low-fi action well, which helps divert attention from the bargain-bin special effects, bad acting and politics."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,40,Single-mindedly action-oriented to the point where Milius's film seems relatively ruminative.
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,40,"A new Red Dawn could have been so much more fun had it thrown a properly out-of-bounds tea party. (It lacks the signature brawn of original director John Milius, a guns-first libertarian.)"
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,38,The filmmakers have altered the premise from the unlikely to the ridiculous.
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,38,Hobbled by a laughably bad script and a uniformly uncharismatic cast.
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,38,"The dull, predictable direction is the perfect match for a watery, nondescript cast."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,38,"A closing scene, rousingly patriotic, takes place back on the football field. I think I'm beginning to understand why the Chinese were not reckoned to be a prime market for this film."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,38,"This world is divided between the makers and the takers, and after just a few minutes of Red Dawn, you'll realize there's not much more you can take."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,33,Red Dawn without the jingoism is like a pie without the filling - it collapses into splintered mush.
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,30,"The new Red Dawn's body count is as high as its predecessor's. But the fatalism in all of Milius' projects - even the silliest ones - has weight. That's not the case with the remake, whose portrayal of violence derives more from video games than from history."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,30,"If it weren't for him (Hemsworth), surely the Red Dawn remake would have gone straight to video; he's the only person worth watching in it (oh the pain of watching the wan Isabel Lucas hoist a rocket launcher)."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,30,"Although the original Red Dawn was far-fetched, the remake offers little but vicarious thrills."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,30,"Could be fun, you might think. No. Bad acting and worse dialogue quickly put an end to that notion."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,25,"The movie never pauses -- at least, not to waste time on anything like developing the female characters. But there's no edge to anything, either dramatically or politically."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,25,"Unfortunately, the characters are so programmatic, the premise so ridiculous and the situations so far-fetched even if you accept that premise that no energy can be built, and the little that's there can't be sustained. Red Dawn is a vigorous but pointless exercise."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,20,This has to be the year's most pointless remake: a boring and badly acted reboot of John Milius's gung-ho red-scare actioner from 1984.
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,20,Long-delayed. Arguably not long enough.
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,20,"In this group, only Hemsworth stands out."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,12,It feeds the warrior fantasies of adolescent boys with a testosterone-heavy tale of a war free of moral complications.
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,10,"Love it or hate it, Milius's original Red Dawn looks like an Akira Kurosawa masterpiece next to this latest iteration, directed by Dan Bradley."
Red Dawn,5.4,44806783,10,"And so, nearly four years since it rolled cameras, the sun rises on another Red Dawn, which supplements the irresponsibility of the original with an incompetency all its own."
Young Guns II,6.5,44143410,80,Young Guns II generates more sheer visual excitement than any Western since Peckinpah and Leone were in their last '70s prime.
Young Guns II,6.5,44143410,63,"An affectionate and entertaining tribute to the Western - but, Estevez aside, Young Guns II doesn't exactly add much to the old genre."
Young Guns II,6.5,44143410,63,"Although it's more ambitious than most sequels, Young Guns II exhausts its most inspired moment during the opening credits and fades into a copy of its 1988 predecessor - a slick, glossy MTV-style western."
Young Guns II,6.5,44143410,60,"The screenplay feels unfinished, the direction is ambling, but the performances are interesting."
Young Guns II,6.5,44143410,60,"Young Guns II concentrates principally on the drawing power of the post-adolescent heartthrobs in its cast. This approach has its appeal in limited doses, but it makes for a western that's smaller than life."
Young Guns II,6.5,44143410,50,"A far more stylistically assured film than its fey predecessor, though it still carries almost no conviction."
Young Guns II,6.5,44143410,50,"Whenever a few of the Young Guns get together and have to behave like soulful cowboys, the movie stops dead in its tracks. The trouble with so many of today’s young actors is that there’s no deep-seated yearning or fury in their performances. They just seem like well-adjusted California kids putting on a show for a few hours."
Young Guns II,6.5,44143410,50,"The plot is all pot-shots and posses, with a bit of Indian hocus-pocus thrown in for comic relief. In other words, more of the same."
Young Guns II,6.5,44143410,50,A roundup of tired cliches and tired acting -- except for Sutherland and Petersen -- Young Guns II is dull as beans and lazy as tumbleweed.
Young Guns II,6.5,44143410,50,"Besides featuring some of the same actors in the same roles, what this six-gun sequel has in common with Young Guns is that it is wholly unmemorable."
Young Guns II,6.5,44143410,50,"The first Young Guns, in 1988, was an endurance test for all but those who think ogling young actors in tight britches is a fascinating way to spend two hours. Though it seems impossible, the sequel is even more excruciating."
Diamonds Are Forever,6.7,43819547,80,"Diamonds Are Forever is great, absurd fun, not only because it recalls the moods and manners of the sixties (which, being over, now seem safely comprehensible), but also because all of the people connected with the movie obviously know what they are up to."
Diamonds Are Forever,6.7,43819547,75,"We see different movies for different reasons, and Diamonds Are Forever is great at doing the things we see a James Bond movie for."
Diamonds Are Forever,6.7,43819547,67,"Between Plenty O'Toole and Tiffany Case, the diamond smuggler, this film is as over-the-top as they come."
Diamonds Are Forever,6.7,43819547,63,"Diamonds Are Forever is plagued with problems. After a promising start, the story devolves into idiocy."
Diamonds Are Forever,6.7,43819547,60,"Connery has a ball with great stunts, snappy dialogue and a bevy of typically Bondish beauties."
Diamonds Are Forever,6.7,43819547,60,"Whatever connection Bond had to the real world has now been severed in favor of delivering the most satisfying possible experience for audiences, such as a throwaway scene of Q using an electromagnetic device to beat the slot machines or allowing homosexual henchmen Wint and Kidd to devise elaborate (and yet easily escapable) traps."
Diamonds Are Forever,6.7,43819547,60,"Apart from a clumsy climax, a wry and exhilarating bit of entertainment."
Diamonds Are Forever,6.7,43819547,60,"The action scenes here are just lame, and given the choice between good action and lame story (as we had in You Only Live Twice) and good story and lame action, I'll take the action every time."
Diamonds Are Forever,6.7,43819547,60,The Las Vegas locations sizzle and the script at least has the good sense not to take itself too seriously.
Diamonds Are Forever,6.7,43819547,50,"Assorted ladies, a few quick lines, and one good chase, making for a mediocre entry in the series."

Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,75,"Fuqua takes a genre picture and, by diverting the story onto an unconventional path, generates a sense of urgency. Tears of the Sun is not a great movie, but it is satisfying, and represents an example of accomplished filmmaking."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,75,"Whenever its noble aims miss, Bruce Willis saves it."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,75,"Fuqua and his writers, Alex Lasker and Patrick Cirillo, have delivered not only the most satisfying and plausible action movie in months but one that's accidentally timely."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,75,"Until it descends into mindless routine action in the climactic scenes, Tears of the Sun is essentially an impressionistic nightmare."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,75,"The film would be just as powerful, if less likely to saturate suburban megaplexes and flatter its patrons, were its saviors -- I don't know - French."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,70,"This is an odd amalgam of bleeding-heart sentimentality and over-the-top guts-and-glory action. You're not sure how to feel. But you're certainly not as moved and stunned as you were in ""Black Hawk Down."""

Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,60,This is one of those pictures that unavoidably becomes part of the zeitgeist due to its coincidental arrival at a precise moment in history when its themes play into current events.
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,60,What pushes it above mediocrity is that it ends better than it begins.
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"Despite the busy camera work, bombastic score and rapt attention to violence, director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) can't mask the script's white-savior paternalism."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"In a movie with so much graphic suffering by innocent Africans, its a bit disconcerting that so much loving attention is paid to Bruce Williss anguished mug. Theres an uncomfortable Great White Father (and Mother) aspect to this movie."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"Fuqua has made three films before his newest, Tears of the Sun, and they've all begun well enough but then collapsed under the weight of his heavy-handed visual technique and his indifference to plot, character and logic."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"May make you weep, but not in the way anyone intended.

Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"Tried to turn this into a replay of its 2000 military-rescue hitBlack Hawk Down -- though, in the end, it's almost totally lacking in the serious hardware and viscerally paced action that propelled Ridley Scott's movie to the top of the box office."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,It's simplistic and reactionary and designed to get hearts pumping but not minds thinking.

Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"The result is hardly a subtle film, but it has a stronger sense of combat's real costs and consequences than more sensationalistic pictures like ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""We Were Soldiers"" provide."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"Has honorable aspirations, even as it becomes mired in mainstream movie conventions."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"For a film so intent on the rules of engagement, this is hardly engaging drama."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,42,"There's a fine line dividing Hollywood tradition and overly manipulative junk, and Tears of the Sun crosses it."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,40,"Aside from a few routine battle scenes, the movie's action consists mostly of people slogging slowly through non-stop rain. This is not interesting, much less exciting. The dialogue is hokey hero blather."

Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,20,"This ""Black Hawk Down"" theft is a trial by cliché until the climax, which suggests a dress rehearsal for the torching of Baghdad."

Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,43585753,70,"Between the carefully trained animals and their computer-animated mouths, the movie doesn't have much room for realism; but the 3-D effects are surprisingly effective, and this playful pic earns a pat on the head."
Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,43585753,63,"With action aplenty, talking animals and enough gags to make any sane grown-up groan, ""The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" is a harmless but fun hot-weather diversion for the family."
Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,43585753,63,"A clever, funny movie that will entertain kids and adults."
Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,43585753,60,This isn't so much that the story and characters are weak -- though they very much are -- but that animatronics and computer animation so anthropomorphize these critters that they bear more resemblance to cartoons than actual flesh-and-fur animals.
Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,43585753,50,Stands to delight small children while probably causing their parents' heads to cave in.
Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,43585753,50,Though better than its 2001 predecessor -- and teeming with cute creatures and fast and furious action scenes -- the movie feels excessively formulaic.

Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,43585753,38,"Mostly, though, ""Kitty Galore"" is a grind, as well as proof that ""What up, dog?"" isn't any funnier when a pigeon says it to a dog."
Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,43585753,30,"Although it's great fun for the under-8 set and for those of us monitoring the chaos theory that is Nolte's career of late, this film is otherwise mediocre and features some of the most uninvolving 3-D CGI since ""Clash of the Titans"" earlier this year."
Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,43585753,30,About as unremarkable as a film about talking animals organized into competing intelligence agencies can be.

Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,43585753,25,"Aside from uninspired movie-parody gags, Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore suffers from gadget overload."
Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,43585753,25,"Is it mindless fun for the kids in an air-conditioned environment? I guess, sure, but it's maddening how many details in Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore are swiped wholesale from other stories."
Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,4.3,43585753,25,"Fails to deliver enough clever gags, emotional warmth, or eye-popping 3D to compete with recent family releases."

Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,75,"It's the cars, and the mega-horsepowered action, that matter most. With its driver-POV spinouts, wrong-way chases, and multilane median jumps, the movie is a roaring revel of an automotive fantasy."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,70,"Need For Speed modifies its outlaw antihero with all sorts of unnecessary pain and backstory, and the film is slow to leave the starting gate because of it. But once it does, Need For Speed becomes a much fleeter vehicle, powered by impressive practical stuntwork, eye-popping cross-country landscapes, and the sparking chemistry between Paul and Poots."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,67,"Need For Speed’s dialogue-centric scenes are often clunky, and its comic relief is at times embarrassingly unfunny, but whenever Waugh shifts his focus to figuring out how to best convey an ingenious practical stunt with the camera, the movie comes alive."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,63,The best parts of Need for Speed are the actual racing and chasing sequences — a true thrill ride for the audience as the story unfolds.
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,63,"When the actors are in cars, the movie's fun. When they get out to argue, or seethe, it's uh-oh time. Happily, director Scott Waugh comes out of the stunt world himself, and there's a refreshing emphasis on actual, theoretically dangerous stunt driving over digital absurdities."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,60,Subtle it isn't. But the entertainment rev counter more or less keeps turning over.
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,60,"This is cinema reduced or distilled to its purest definition, of movies that move. If you want dewy humanity in your entertainment, watch Lifetime."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,60,"An energetic, unpretentious B movie — the kind best seen at a drive-in like the one in an early scene — it is devoted, above all, to the delivery of visceral, kinetic excitement."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,60,"A snoozy-but-diverting, lightly constipated B-movie."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,60,"Paul plays the part with the flinty, tightly wound charisma of a small man who makes up in moxie what he lacks in stature. There’s something of the young James Cagney in him, and he’s by far the best thing Need for Speed has going for it."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,50,"Every stage of the race and chase is announced on a webcast conducted by the secret impresario of the illegal De Leon race, a billionaire car enthusiast known as the Monarch, who “nobody knows.” Actually, the Monarch is clearly visible in a corner of the computer screen and he’s played, with jive-spouting brio by Michael Keaton. Hey, the movie isn’t called Need for Logic."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,50,Credit to Aaron Paul for fully committing to this ridiculousness. There isn’t a scene he doesn’t play with the utmost seriousness.
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,50,"Based on the popular video games, this is a movie with breathtakingly visceral racing scenes, and they are matched by a breathtakingly, breathtakingly terrible script."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,50,"Waugh has a good feel for the cars and action extremes, while director of photography Shane Hurlbut acquits himself nicely. But the screenplay written by George Gatins is full of potholes."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,50,"The cast doesn’t have the sassy swagger of the “Fast & Furious” crew. Paul, surrounded by co-stars of the same modest height, isn’t particularly charismatic in this setting. He’s not a natural “quiet tough guy.” But the actors are second bananas here — to the Koenigsegg Ageras, Saleens and Shelby Mustang that feed America’s Need for Speed, on screen and off. And the cars deliver."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,50,"A moderately popular racing series that the powers that be have tried to turn into a turbo-boosted stunt-car extravaganza of the same make and model as the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,50,"Less a three-lane pile-up than a minor traffic violation in a residential area. Three points for Waugh, then, and a £60 fine."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,40,"If not for the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, Need for Speed probably wouldn't exist outside of the video game series that inspired it."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,40,"The racing scenes are its one hope of reclaiming your attention, but there aren’t nearly enough of them to justify such a killing duration."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,40,"If you like watching people drive really nice cars really fast, Need for Speed scratches that particular itch. But expect nothing more, because everything else about it is just running on empty."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,40,"After a creaky, clichéd start, Need for Speed picks up a bit. The script is still as corny as hell, but the chase scenes are pretty spectacular."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,40,"Need For Speed is a flat, sexless movie that seems not to understand why people like to sit in the driver’s seat and rev that big engine: Because of the transgressive rumble in your nethers."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,40,"The cars are hot, the action is decent, but the characters and plot need a serious tune-up."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,40,"Director Scott Waugh’s intention may have been to elevate my pulse, but the only thing at which he succeeded was getting me to check my watch repeatedly."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,38,"Ostensibly meant to be light entertainment. If light is synonymous with preposterous, frenetic and noisy, it qualifies."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,38,"All that’s missing is Clyde the orangutan from Clint Eastwood’s “Every Which Way But Loose,” which, trust me, this movie could have used."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,38,There's nothing to distract you from a plot so tired there are tire tracks from other racing movies all over it.
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,38,"Young men and fast cars are automatically stupid together, but even if you set your intelligence level at “off” — and you should — you’ll get a hangover from this cocktail of 200-proof stupid, clinking with moron ice cubes and with an idiot cherry on top."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,38,Need for Speed is a piece of auto-collision pornography that weighs down its car-flip-and-massive-fireball money shots with a preposterous plot involving vehicular manslaughter vengeance.
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,37,"Need For Speed is several different movies at once, and most of them are very stupid."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,33,"From the start, Need for Speed smells like a movie in search of a franchise. On that count, it’s somewhat fast but seldom furious."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,30,"The resulting mishmash is as exciting as getting a tow from AAA, and just as slow."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,25,"Need For Speed possesses eye-rolling, tone deaf dialogue, passable performances (unless you’re Dominic Cooper or Kid Cudi) and plotting so conventional, there’s not even one surprise U-turn anywhere."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,25,"Even when compared to other films posing as Ford Mustang commercials, Need for Speed isn't particularly memorable for anything other than the startling incompetence and dull sheen of the end result."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,25,"Do not attempt to see this film, derived loosely from the videogame of the same name, unless you're prepared for wobbly writing, lead-footed direction and acting that must have been boosted by nitrous-oxide injectors, plus a starring performance that could have used a boost and didn't get one."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,20,"This movie is so dumb for most of its running time, you walk away wishing there was less plot and pointless posing and more of the fuel-injected coolness that brought you to the multiplex in the first place."
Need for Speed,6.5,43577636,20,"Scott Waugh's moronic flick has multiple personalities — it's the Sibyl of street racing, with a script that doesn't feel so much typed as button-mashed."
Everest,7.1,43482270,89,"This is a movie you feel deeply in the pit of your stomach. Sometimes, it literally hurts to watch it."
Everest,7.1,43482270,88,"The mountain, grim and unforgiving, remains the star."
Everest,7.1,43482270,88,This is what filmed spectacle used to look like — a  trip to a place or time most of us could never see.
Everest,7.1,43482270,83,"It lacks the same constant surprises of last year's ""Gravity"" or the visual poetry of ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" but Kormákur's movie nonetheless marks the rare fusion of effective craftsmanship with focused storytelling."
Everest,7.1,43482270,80,"It succeeds wonderfully, offering moviegoers a rare taste of rarified air -- and as compelling an argument as you can make for seeing a movie writ large on the oversized screen of an actual movie theater."
Everest,7.1,43482270,80,"Like the mountain for which it’s named, Everest is rock solid. It’s big, it’s beautiful, it’s terrifying, and it’s merciless to both its characters and the audience."
Everest,7.1,43482270,80,Kormákur creates such a convincing world – the craft of this film is astonishing – that you’re willing to forgive its less delicate touches in favour of its totally compelling depiction of what it must be like to ascend into a place that’s heaven one moment and hell the very next.
Everest,7.1,43482270,80,"With its perilous central premise and gallery of individuals some of whom are destined not to make it, you could say Everest is a disaster movie in the old Hollywood sense of the term, but it doesn't feel like one. And that's a good thing."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"There is no tragic hero here; there is no overarching explanation, but a movie that offered either of those would seem pretty pat. Take it or leave, Everest is just there."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"Part IMAX nature documentary and part Hollywood disaster movie, it does an effective job of conveying what it’s like to climb the mountain, the hours and days spent acclimating on practice hikes, and the punishing physical effects that accompany each subsequent change of altitude."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"In this case, character development is neglected in favor of awe-inspiring views. There are times when we feel like we're on the mountain. Unfortunately, our companions - the men and women populating the screen - are never more than half-formed."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,Director Baltasar Kormákur (“2 Guns”) and his cast craft a lean narrative tone that humanizes the action without an excess of gloss.
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"There have been plenty of mountaineering documentaries over the last few years, and Everest suffers in comparison to them simply by being a dramatization. As realistic as the effects are (and you can occasionally tell when a shot is green-screened), you're still aware on a gut level that Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin were not actually filmed at 29,000 feet above sea level."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"There's only one star in this movie: Everest. Kormákur couldn't shoot higher than base camp, around 14,000 feet, without sickening the actors. But a crew traveled to the top to get footage, while much of the climbing was shot in the Dolomites. No matter. You watch Everest and you believe."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"Based on true events, filled with stunning visuals and featuring more than a half-dozen of our best actors delivering solid performances, Baltasar Kormakur’s Everest is a high-altitude roller coaster ride that will leave you drained."
Everest,7.1,43482270,70,"Everest may disappoint those looking for a more awe-inspiring film with big vistas and jaw-dropping stunts and acts of surreal heroism. Unlike many mountain-disaster stories, this is the kind that makes you never want to look at a mountain again."
Everest,7.1,43482270,70,"Kormakur doesn’t make the mistake of exalting his subjects as extraordinary individuals, or suggesting that they were obeying some sort of noble higher calling. Everest is blunt, businesslike and — as it begins its long march through the death zone — something of an achievement."
Everest,7.1,43482270,67,Director Baltasar Kormakur (2 Guns) essentially made a faux documentary with big stars and better lighting.
Everest,7.1,43482270,67,"When the lights come up, you don’t want to feel like you’ve watched a ­better Cliffhanger. You want to understand the tragedy you’ve just watched. Yes, you want to be entertained, but you also want the icy, whipping wind of reality to sting."
Everest,7.1,43482270,67,"Salvatore Totino's crisp 3D photography and Kormakur's way with a clear, fluid, thrilling action sequence show off the mountain in immensely impressive ways. But the humans involved get short shrift."
Everest,7.1,43482270,63,There’s a resemblance here to both the story and the movie adaptation of the story told in “The Perfect Storm.” The characters involved are making a good faith effort—but good faith efforts by humans can only go so far.
Everest,7.1,43482270,63,"It feels less like an cautionary adventure movie or the classy Hollywood equivalent of a Reader's Digest ""Drama in Real Life"" and much more like a disaster epic."
Everest,7.1,43482270,63,"Everest gets several things right, but it fails to find a way to make the average viewer relate to the people on the mountain."
Everest,7.1,43482270,63,"A fairly good, extremely grueling movie as far as it goes — tracks the true-life fortunes of a battered group of climbers to the highest place on Earth. Yet somehow it doesn't go far enough."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Though there is heroism as well as love here, because it involves the deaths of people we have come to care about, Everest is finally a sad story, though not always a dramatically involving one."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Everest is a sprawling mess of a movie, one you feel like could have been great but instead roams all over the place and winds up being just pretty good."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Everest is visually splendid, though it loses a few points for its murkiness in rendering its main characters as distinct individuals."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"A valiant effort that never quite scales the dizzy emotional heights required, running out of oxygen in the final act. Visually, though, it’s stunning."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Spectacular and well-acted, this suffers from much the same problem as the situation it depicts — too many people on the mountain and too many threads to follow so that affecting individual stories get lost in the snow."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Ultimately, Everest is not concerned with the why, but with the how and it's grimly efficient at building up the drama, helped on by Clarke's wonderful character study, even if the film as a whole never quite reaches the dizzying heights of its subject."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"The hardship of the trek is vividly and stomach-lurchingly portrayed, particularly when the storm sets in, but it never makes the crucial leap from the screen into your bones."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"This is one of those cases where fictionalizing a true event, or at least fusing two or three real people into one composite character, might have resulted in tighter storytelling."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Everest, in short, suffers from the same problem as Everest: overcrowding."
Everest,7.1,43482270,50,"The feature film Everest provides soaring visuals, but it’s a distant second in terms of storytelling depth and narrative impact."
Everest,7.1,43482270,50,"Though it assembles a first-rate cast in a story taken from reality, Everest feels icebound and strangely abstract, lacking the gravity of genuine tragedy or the swagger of first-rate adventure."
Everest,7.1,43482270,50,"While it’s impossible not to be somewhat caught up in these climbers’ life-or-death struggle, Everest is oddly uninvolving — it depicts a horrific scenario in an underwhelming, distancing way."
Everest,7.1,43482270,50,"Everest is a frustrating movie in many ways – despite some lurches and shocks, it doesn’t quite deliver the edge-of-your-seat thrills that many were hoping for, and all those moderately engaging characters mean that there is no centrally powerful character."
Everest,7.1,43482270,40,"The director was Baltasar Kormákur, a gifted filmmaker from Iceland who shouldn’t be blamed for a case of industrial filmmaking gone wrong — the culprits in elaborate clunkers like this are usually the producers and the studios."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,70,"Familiarity and continuity are what the success of this series has always been about. We've been here before, and we like the neighborhood."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,67,"Has a delightfully nasty villain and pumped-up action, albeit along familiar lines."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,67,A little bit obsessed with replication.
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,63,The venerable series is looking outmoded and outdated. Media saturation and age have taken their toll.
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,63,"If anyone tries to tell you how this one ends, blast 'em with a phaser. Set on stun, of course."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,63,"Fails to match the philosophical and acting bounties of 1996's ''First Contact.'' Baird has seen to it that the Enterprise's being under fire still amounts to the crew rocking back and forth, gripping the railings as the ship's phasers are down to 4 percent."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,63,"This is a better movie than the vacuous ""Insurrection,"" thanks largely to a sympathetic screenwriter, longtime ""Trek"" fanatic John Logan (""Gladiator""), and a crew (headed by Patrick Stewart's Capt. Jean-Luc Picard and Brent Spiner's android Data) determined to go out in glory."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,63,"Unfortunately, the plot runs out of dilithium crystals, and drifts to a sluggish and predictable conclusion"
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,63,"While Star Trek: Nemesis isn't nearly as good as the best Nicholas Meyer-written movies like ""The Undiscovered Country,"" it is far from the worst, thanks to the topical issues it raises, the performances of Stewart and Hardy, and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,63,"Once again, perhaps the most impressive effect is Patrick Stewart as Captain Picard, using his Shakespearean training to make long mouthfuls of nonsense sound almost persuasive."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,63,"It combines elements of ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Star Wars"" and James Bond flicks with generically satisfying results."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,60,"Nemesis never feels true to itself, its energy never fully engaged. Even with Earth on the line in its climactic space battle, the film seems embarrassed that it couldn't have found a better way to work through its issues."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,60,"Once it reaches the meat of the story, it seems to lose its confidence."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,60,Reasonably entertaining if utterly familiar entry in the long-running SF franchise.
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,60,"An amiably klutzy affair whose warm, fuzzy heart emits intermittent bleats from the sleeve of its gleaming spacesuit."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,60,The humor is not as hackneyed as in previous films.
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,60,"Despite the intriguing set-up, there's something unambitious and scaled-back about Star Trek Nemesis, so that most of the time it feels like a slightly suped-up episode of the ""Next Generation"" TV series."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,50,Fails to engage.
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,50,"As spent screen series go, Star Trek: Nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,50,"Conventional wisdom has it that the best Star Trek movies are the even-numbered ones. Nemesis may keep that streak alive, but barely."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,50,"Star Trek is over for me. I've been looking at these stories for half a halftime, and, let's face it, they're out of gas."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,50,"As Shinzon, a sickly boy-emperor grown from Picard's DNA by scheming Romulans, Tom Hardy channels some of the verve of rich-Corinthian-leather-clad Khan villain Ricardo Montalban, although his real model seems to be Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,50,"Even though it doesn't feel like an appropriate send-off, the lethargy of Star Trek: Nemesis is probably indication enough that the series should end here."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,40,"Nemesis, by comparison, is about as exciting as a Tribble on Vicodin."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,40,"Plays like a greatest-hits remix; like ""Die Another Day,"" it's bent on resurrecting a moribund franchise by recalling all the things you used to love about it till you grew into big-boy pants."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,38,"There comes a time when the future looks old, and that's where ""Star Trek"" finds itself on the time-space continuum."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,30,An ordeal for all save the most ardent Treksters.
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,30,Collapsed into the black hole of its own mythology.
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,30,An offering so endearingly lame it seems to have missed the past 10 years' worth of special-effects breakthroughs.
K-9,6,43247647,70,"It's enjoyable, thanks not only to its charismatic duo, but also to the skilled comedy direction of Rod Daniel, whose strong sense of pacing is enhanced by Miles Goodman's driving but not overpowering score."
K-9,6,43247647,60,"This is actually better than it may sound, though rather less charming than it would like to, and needs to be."
K-9,6,43247647,50,"If the crime elements in K-9 are routine, the relationship between Belushi and the dog at least has the courage to be goofy."
K-9,6,43247647,50,"K-9 doesn't have a shred of credibility. And Mr. Belushi, despite some rough edges, lacks a strong enough macho growl to make Dooley seem like a police dog in human clothing. But with its surefire dog tricks and breezy pacing, K-9 is at least mildly diverting."
K-9,6,43247647,50,"The plot has lots of holes, but veteran TV director Rod Daniel keeps the proceedings light and lively, and Belushi does a fine job of relating to a dog as a multidimensional character. Jerry Lee--while no Benji in the acting department--is likable and receives ample help from the film's editors."
K-9,6,43247647,50,"Belushi is fetching, though he plays a cliche'. But the movie would roll over and play dead without the talented German shepherd. Lassie was classy and Benji beguiling, but Jerry Lee is a four-legged Burt Reynolds, just made for fast cars and chase scenes."
K-9,6,43247647,50,"There are a few amazing moments (the dog’s rescue of Belushi in a bar). In between lingers lots of standard action-pic fare, plenty of toothless jokes and some down-right mangy dialog."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,88,"The plot of Point Blank, summarized, invites parody (rookie agent goes undercover as surfer to catch bank robbers). The result is surprisingly effective."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,88,"At her best—and even in a hand-me-down project like Point Break—Bigelow is a uniquely talented, uniquely powerful filmmaker. Where the male action directors are still playing with toys-with dolls and models and matte shots-Bigelow has tapped into something primal and strong. She is a sensualist of genius in this most sensual of mediums."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,75,"Point Break, though it's anything but watertight where plotting is concerned, again reveals Ms. Bigelow's real talents as a director of fast-paced, high-adrenaline action. Whenever the flakiness of Point Break threatens to become lulling, Ms. Bigelow wakes up her audience with a formidable jolt."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,75,"In terms of Hollywood history, Bigelow's film is the perfect document of its time."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,70,"What saves Point Break from wipeout is Kathryn Bigelow's direction. Though the film lacks the formal beauty and allure of her Near Dark and Blue Steel, Bigelow keeps the action percolating in high style."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,70,Director Kathryn Bigelow is one of the new-style action wizards who’ve never quite mastered the nuts and bolts of telling a story.
Point Break,7.2,43218387,63,"Point Break has its areas of excitement, but on too many occasions the movie just lies there -- even when it does, however, the film still manages to look and sound good."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,63,"A lot of what Bigelow puts up on the screen bypasses the brain altogether, plugging directly into our viscera, our gut. The surfing scenes in particular are majestically powerful, even awe-inspiring. Bigelow's picture is a feast for the eyes, but we watch movies with more than our eyes. She seduces us, then asks us to be bimbos."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,63,"Bigelow stages the film's action sequences with a brutal efficiency (they almost redeem the movie), but she can't keep the increasingly silly script in check."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,58,"For an hour or so, Bigelow (Near Dark, Blue Steel) gets by on that great eye of hers. But about halfway, Point Break breaks down. The plot, which has been unimpressive but not irritating, becomes maddeningly implausible. And the performances, which had been generally engaging, lose their edge."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,50,"A hare-brained wild ride through big surf and bad vibes, Point Break acts like a huge, nasty wave, picking up viewers for a few major thrills but ultimately grinding them into the sand via overkill and absurdity."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,50,"It's a movie that's almost all style, all technique. It doesn't seem to be inhabited by people, thoughts or feelings, but by great coruscating patterns of light crashing over and over us, repeatedly--almost, but not quite, drowning out a constant buzz of cliches."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,80,Transporter 2 really does deliver the goods.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,80,"This ridiculously entertaining sequel is that rare part deux that leaves you hankering for part trois. The action is, in a word, spectacular, but also playful, inventive and witty."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,80,Delivers a satisfying late-summer escapist treat.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,75,"In fact the sequel is a better film than the original, as if writer-producer Luc Besson had a clearer idea of what he wanted to do (and didn't want to do)."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,70,Slick kidnapping yarn starts off like a bat out of hell and never sags.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,70,Transporter 2 was directed by Louis Leterrier and he exemplifies a perfect style for this type of film by showing us the action without editing it to bits.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,70,That a movie can run on empty and still be so obscenely enjoyable is a pretty slick stunt in itself.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,70,Statham isn't the best thing in Transporter 2; he's essentially the only thing.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,70,"Chucks the laws of logic and physics out the passenger's-side window, and it's all the better for it."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,70,"The computer-enhanced vehicle chases look fake, but the hand-to-hand combat scenes are the best of the year."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,63,"Stands a triumph of stunts over plot, of style over substance--of the wool we pull over our own eyes. It's brainless, high-speed, popcorn fun."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,63,But certainly this is a movie for fans of Willis-style action with a little James Bond and probable instant obsolescence thrown in.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,63,"It busts the credibility meter early on, quickly becomes preposterous, and then really lets its imagination rip."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,63,"Loud, kinetic, unflinching action."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,60,"Purely shallow but never dull, the film wisely pushes the limits of absurdity to the extreme, making it easier to submit to its sheer camp."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,60,"Another all-kicking, punching, shooting and exploding dose of Besson born action, and Jason Statham proves that his action mettle in the first instalment was no fluke."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,58,"The greatest thing about the movie is Statham, a charismatic silent, deadly type who deserves to take the wheel behind a better franchise."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,"When the spectacle turns ridiculous, the movie just becomes another big-screen video game."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,"I just saw The Transporter 2 on the way home from the lobotomy clinic, and boy, is it enjoyable. What a difference a simple operation makes!"
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,"Like a cross between ""Man on Fire"" and ""Bad Boys 2,"" this demolition derby delivers eye-popping action sequences that would make even the Roadrunner roll his eyes in disbelief."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,"For high-speed action, eye-popping locales, and chopsocky fight-fests galore, watch The Transporter - on video."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,If you can get past the impossibilities it is a fun time at the movies.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,A sequel that makes it clear that the outrageous antics of the first movie had a one-time-only charm.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,Choreographer Corey Yuen's use of a fire hose is far more creative than anything in the stale kidnapper plot.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,"Jason Statham is back as the fast-driving, fast-kicking Frank Martin, but this sequel fails to deliver the charm of its predecessor."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,"The original movie's lean production complemented its pell-mell fights and car chases; here, third-rate CG effects make the strained action sequences look even more improbable."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,40,The only glimmer of actual characterization in the entire film comes – all too briefly – from Frank's old boss Inspector Tarconi (Berléand).
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,30,"If not precisely charismatic, Statham brings authentic athleticism and a certain cheeky presence to his lightly written role."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,25,"This stripped-down premise made the first ""Transporter"" fun: It's all about driving skills and choreographed fights, not logic. Even with so few requirements, Transporter 2 runs on empty."
You Only Live Twice,6.9,43084787,100,"Director Lewis Gilbert effortlessly marshals the intricacies of the plot (a nutty plan by SMERSH to ignite a world war), the exotic Japanese locations, and the extravagancies of having hundreds of ninja warriors abseiling into a huge enemy base unfathomably constructed in the belly of an extinct volcano (quite the engineering feat!)."
You Only Live Twice,6.9,43084787,90,What I can say for sure is You Only Live Twice is the Bond film I have seen most often and I have enjoyed the hell out it every single time.
You Only Live Twice,6.9,43084787,88,"From the Eastern flavor of the opening theme, hauntingly sung by Nancy Sinatra, to the Japanese setting, the fifth film is the Bond series just gets better and cooler with age. The tasty script by Roald Dahl junks most of the Fleming novel, spinning its own witty Cold War fantasy."
You Only Live Twice,6.9,43084787,80,"The sight of SPECTRE’s alligator-jawed spacecraft, its maw opening like an evil steel bloom, is one of the single most brilliant visuals in the Bond canon."
You Only Live Twice,6.9,43084787,80,"Although there's a lot more science-fiction than there is first-vintage James Bond in You Only Live Twice, the fifth in a series of veritable Bond films with Sean Connery, there's enough of the bright and bland bravado of the popular British super-sleuth mixed into this melee of rocket-launching to make it a bag of good Bond fun."
You Only Live Twice,6.9,43084787,70,Donald Pleasence makes a suitably menacing German heavy who appears in film’s final scenes.
You Only Live Twice,6.9,43084787,70,"Connery labors mightily. There is still the same Bond grin, still the cool humor under fire, still the slight element of satire. But when he puts on his cute little helmet and is strapped into his helicopter, somehow the whole illusion falls apart and what we're left with is a million-dollar playpen in which everything works but nothing does anything."
You Only Live Twice,6.9,43084787,63,"Unfortunately, this is also among the weakest of the early Bond films, although Connery is in peak form."
You Only Live Twice,6.9,43084787,63,"Nancy Sinatra sings the wistful title song, and the action scenes are enhanced by some of composer John Barry's best work for the Bond series."
You Only Live Twice,6.9,43084787,60,"Roald Dahl's implausible script is padded out with the usual exotic locations, stunts, and trickery."
You Only Live Twice,6.9,43084787,50,"Even Connery seems uncomfortable and fatigued, as if he meant it when he said that this would be his last Bond film. It may just be an off year for 007; it may be that he has received too much ribbing from Casino Royale (TIME, May 12). But it could also be that the monumental Bond issue is at long last beginning to deflate."
You Only Live Twice,6.9,43084787,40,"Tired, poorly paced Bond from 1967, with Sean Connery displaying his discontent. Donald Pleasence's Blofeld has a memorably creepy softness, but that's about it."
You Only Live Twice,6.9,43084787,30,"Connery didn't want to play Bond anymore, and it shows in this forgettable picture. From a stirred, not shaken, martini to the ninja training school to the ""surgery"" to make Bond Japanese (by shaving his chest hair), there's nary a moment of this film that doesn't make any viewer cringe."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,91,"John Wick, is not only a return to badass form for the actor, it's also one of the most excitingly visceral action flicks I've seen in ages."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,90,It's a B movie made with A-student love for the relentless thrill of bodies in brutal motion.
John Wick,7.4,43037835,90,"Harboring few ambitions beyond knock-your-socks-off action sequences, this crafty revenge thriller delivers with so much style — and even some wit — that the lack of substance takes longer than it should to become problematic."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,89,"At the center of it all stands Reeves, a convincing embodiment of both the calm before the storm and its subsequent capacity for ruin."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,88,"A lean, spare, stylish and grimly, methodically ultra-violent extravaganza that provides star Keanu Reeves with a much-needed infusion of cool. And hard-core action fans with combat-centric cinematic expertise on a par with 20ll’s “The Raid.”"
John Wick,7.4,43037835,83,"Their use of Kaleida’s sparse, slinky “Think” — one of the most effective and eccentric sound track choices in a recent action movie — underscores the sense that what the viewer is watching is essentially a very loud and bloody dance piece."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,83,"John Wick won't redefine action movies, but it perfectly exemplifies what I want from an action film when I go. Have fun with the world, shoot the action well, motivate it in a way that doesn't feel cheap."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,82,"The blood-slicked, vividly drawn film universe John Wick illustrates is such a generous slice of pulp that, even if not original, per se, it exudes a confidence rarely seen these days, surefire franchises be damned."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,80,"John Wick has such stylistic assurance that even when it falters – the music’s a bit moronic, and the subtitles for Russian dialogue get a naff, pseudo-pulpy typeface – it mainly tends to remind you how much you’re enjoying everything else."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,80,"Above all else John Wick is a lean, mean revenger to go with its ice-cold protagonist. It's not perfect, but you'll be hard pressed to find a more enjoyable action movie this year."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,80,"A giddy helping of artful violence delivered with a wink and a cheeky grin. Unsurprisingly, John Wick 2 is already in the works."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,80,"With Wick—the best Reeves role in years, and the best existential actioner since Drive—Reeves fans have found something that should cheer them up, too."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,80,"John Wick is a violent, violent, violent film, but its artful splatter is miles away from the brutality of ""Taken"" or the gleeful gore of ""The Equalizer."" It’s a beautiful coffee-table action movie."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,80,"Reeves is wonderful here, a marvel of physicality and stern determination — he moves with the grace of an old-school swashbuckler."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,80,"Distilling a couple of decades of stunt work and second-unit directing experience into 96 minutes of runtime, Stahelski and Leitch expertly deliver one action highlight after another in a near-nonstop thrill ride."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,75,"John Wick is the kind of fired-up, ferocious B-movie fun some of us can't get enough of. You know who you are."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,75,"John Wick is a rousing action thriller of the sort rarely encountered in theaters these days. The once popular genre, which was headlined by the likes of Stallone and Schwarzenegger during its heyday, has been a dying breed during the past two decades."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,75,"John Wick breathes exhilarating life into this tired premise, thanks to some dazzling action choreography, stylish visuals and–most importantly–a vintage anti-hero performance from Keanu Reeves."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,75,"Reeves’ skills are on glorious display in John Wick, an expertly made revenge drama in which he goes all headshot on lots and lots of bad guys, and it’s awesome."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,75,"Neither surprising or groundbreaking in any particular way, the movie gives us what we want and leaves it at that."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,75,There are enough pleasures going on in John Wick to elevate it above just another dumb action movie.
John Wick,7.4,43037835,70,"Quibbles aside, John Wick is the smartest display of the implacable but somehow ethical Reeves character since the ""2008 Street Kings."""
John Wick,7.4,43037835,70,"There's something refreshing about a movie that knows what it is, and what it wants to be. John Wick is that kind of movie."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,70,"Keanu Reeves is the perfect figurehead for this kind of yarn, as he was in The Matrix: Emotionless, poreless, and polished, his character is more a graven idol of vengeance than a human being seeking it."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,70,"Both ludicrous and ludicrously entertaining, John Wick's stylish look, B-movie vibe and less-is-more, longer-takes-are-stronger-takes approach to action make it a standout."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,70,"If you can stomach the setup, then the rest is pure revenge-movie gold, as Reeves reminds what a compelling action star he can be, while the guy who served as his stunt double in “The Matrix” makes a remarkably satisfying directorial debut, delivering a clean, efficient and incredibly assured thriller."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,67,"Director Chad Stahelski — Reeves' stunt double for Point Break and The Matrix — aims only for a kinetic revenge yarn with wrinkles drive-in movie critic Joe Bob Briggs might appreciate, like martial arts moves at point blank bullet range; what he'd call gun fu."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,63,"The movie’s one big pitfall, really, is that Reeves’s character is so intently focused, he takes care of business a bit too quickly. Some final skirmishing and a tonally false sign-off feel like unconvincing bids to stretch the story to a more legit feature length."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,63,"The film is thematically thin, and it has a tendency to embrace the action genre's more obnoxious elements, but there's a proudly no-nonsense air to its nonsensicality."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,63,"Like so many action movies, John Wick goes way beyond a reasonable carnage threshold. Brawls that are exciting in the beginning become dull as each sequence attempts to outdo the last. But John Wick has a more interesting story and better fights than most."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,63,"Reeves animates the action and the filmmakers surround him with wonderful co-stars; the quietly menacing McShane, the chop shop operator (John Leguizamo), the dapper “cleaner” (David Patrick Kelly of “The Warriors”) and the spitting, hissing Nyqvist."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,60,John Wick feels like action manna for its cleanly designed gun-fu sequences—ones you can actually follow—and brutal takedowns. But the revenge plotting is deeply dopey and we shouldn't have to choose one or the other.
John Wick,7.4,43037835,60,"Plot is not the movie’s strong suit. But stylish set pieces are, including one epic blast-a-thon alongside a pool."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,58,"There are some attempts at a comic-bookish, film noir vibe, including a hotel where all the crooks and killers stay, forbidden by house rules from ""doing business""on the premises. And everywhere Keanu turns, he bumps into a character from HBO."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,50,"John Wick reminds you this actor deserves better. Reeves makes the movie entertaining in a background-noise way, but he can’t give it any gravity, even when the filmmakers pull the cheapest trick in the book to get the audience to root for the hero and hiss at the Eurotrash villains. Someone get this man some good work, quick."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,40,"John Wick makes a few feeble attempts at witty repartee, but, in the end, Leitch and Stahelski's film feels like an unintentional parody of itself."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,38,"Aside from the very occasional stab with a dagger, John prefers to shoot people at point-blank range. It gets old fast."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,38,"John Wick serves up a noxious, clashing blend of hyper-realistic and cartoonish violence. Too bad there's no cinema decontaminating service that can wash our memories clean of such useless gore."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,38,"Sorry, Keanu, but you stole my time and you murdered my brain cells. By the sacred oath of WHOA, there will be blood, and this time it’s personal."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,12,"John Wick is the most blatant attempt to establish a character’s name recognition since the Angelina Jolie actioneer ""Salt."""
Snitch,6.5,42930462,83,"Snitch is grittily streetwise, and until its last 20 minutes fairly credible compared to other movies ""inspired by"" true stories."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,75,"Despite its apparent compromises to noble finger-wagging (initially) and requisite fist-pumping (eventually), Waugh has fashioned a sturdy character-first entertainment out of Snitch at a time of year when those are all too rare to behold."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,75,"Pleasant because, instead of the usual hero-and-mayhem jive, Snitch is an honest exercise in workmanlike craft. This is to film what ceramic is to floors or Billy is to bookcase or what a third-line centre is to a winning hockey team – hardly great but good and solid and functional."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,75,"In its focus on an ordinary family facing a nightmarish scenario, Snitch is a terrifying but relatable story."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,75,"It's an entertaining picture — pulp, coming from a place of righteous indignation."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,70,"There’s a lot of cartoonish potential in Snitch, but director Ric Roman Waugh (who previously made the excellent prison drama ""Felon,"" another exercise in somber desperation) seems intent on trying to sell the movie as a more serious enterprise. And amazingly, the gambit works."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,70,"Unusual for this sort of thing, Snitch is a film after which you remember the characters and actors more than the big action moments."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,67,Snitch toys with moral ambiguity and fatalism before losing its nerve and delivering the action-movie goods in a climax that hews closer to fantasy than the keenly observed realism of the film’s solid center.
Snitch,6.5,42930462,63,"Snitch is protein-and-starch filmmaking at its utilitarian -- and belly-filling -- best. Johnson brings the steak; Bernthal the sizzle. The father-son drama is served up as sauce on the side. But as long as the beef isn’t too overcooked, who needs the A1?"
Snitch,6.5,42930462,63,"Snitch gets a decent amount of drama (and action, of course) out of the argument that there’s paying for a crime, and then there’s overpaying."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,63,"Directed by veteran stuntman Ric Roman Waugh, Snitch is shot with a mix of nervous close-ups and weirdly vertiginous angles."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,63,Who would have guessed Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson would deliver the best work of his career playing a guy who squares off against a pack of small-time street thugs.
Snitch,6.5,42930462,63,"What gives it’s juice is the supporting cast. John Bernthal (“The Walking Dead”) is credibly wary as the ex-con John begs to get him in the door of the drug world. And the terrific Michael Kenneth Williams is the first dealer he meets, a guy who pulls a gun on him just to test him."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,60,"While not the balls-out action movie the marketing suggests, this Rock-powered family drama is not with its moments."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,60,"Snitch is a movie that cries out for the wiry B stars of yore: Robert Forster, a younger Tommy Lee Jones. And it would have occurred to a craftier screenwriter to make his hero’s walk on the criminal wild side a touch more tempting."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,60,Although Johnson performs admirably in the drama-heavy role — far better than many of his action-hero colleagues would manage — John Matthews is a character as boring as his name.
Snitch,6.5,42930462,60,"It's nice to have actors of Sarandon and Pepper's caliber onboard for the office-bound wheeler-dealer scenes, but mostly, it's the prospect of witnessing Johnson at the helm of an 18-wheeler as he rams his way through machine-gun fire that excites."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,55,Whatever lizard-brain fun might have been had in watching Johnson do battle against a drug cartel is weakened by the occasional hard tug at the social conscience. The film winds up divided against itself.
Snitch,6.5,42930462,50,"Not the usual action movie. It's too odd for that. Based on a true story, it has the weirdness of real life, which is good. But also like real life, it has that funny way of not making much sense or being all that enjoyable."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,50,A glorified TV movie.
Snitch,6.5,42930462,50,"For all its violence and road rage, Snitch doesn’t disintegrate into noisy popcorn nonsense."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,50,"Someone please get director Ric Roman Waugh a tripod! Snitch might be a passable action-thriller but it's hard to say because every time an action scene comes along, the image shakes so badly it's impossible to keep anything in view or focus."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,50,The verdict on Snitch is that Johnson has attempted a career detour on a street marked Do Not Enter.
Snitch,6.5,42930462,50,"Unfortunately, Snitch is torn between being an ideological drama and a more traditional action film – and Johnson’s presence only contributes to the confusion."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,42,"The film tries to paint in shades of gray with vague criticisms of the war on drugs, but the absurdity of its he-man Everyman plot ends up turning its moral palette a muddy brown."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,40,Neither clever nor stupid enough to work.
Snitch,6.5,42930462,40,Good intentions are all but submerged in nonsense.
Snitch,6.5,42930462,40,"This is the sort of movie that Charles Bronson would have made back in the day, and indeed a shot of Johnson standing in a sporting goods store, contemplating a wall of shotguns as he gets ready to get busy, could have come from any ""Death Wish."""
Snitch,6.5,42930462,40,"All the talking would be fine, but the dialogue is preachy, the drama too earnest and the action kind of sluggish, though it's hard not to get a jolt when Johnson jumps behind the wheel."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,40,"Snitch is like watching an elephant on ice: inelegant, but you admire the effort."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,30,"Snitch wasn’t going to be good no matter what Johnson did; it is so poorly directed that even Academy Award winner Susan Sarandon, playing a shrewish federal prosecutor, comes off as a hack straight off a soap opera."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,30,"Though Snitch loudly announces itself as a social-issues movie, its nominal outrage over the severity of our nation's sentencing laws for first-time drug offenders is quickly subsumed by a jacked-up narrative of a father going to extremes to save his son."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,25,"Snitch is just a big, dumb, ugly-looking waste of time, one that turns one of cinema's most charismatic heroes into a restless drone. As they say in the joint: snitches get stitches. But Snitch deserves to be put down for good."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,25,Snitch is the latest in a long line of films whose sole purpose is to flatten a major social problem into a pulp ideal for self-serious spectacle.
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,90,"More important, we should take into account the fact that this is really quite a good movie--a character-driven (as opposed to whammy-driven) suspense drama--dark, fatalistic and, within its melodramatically stretched terms, emotionally plausible."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,90,"Mr. Pitt moves through this unexpectedly solid thriller with dazzling confidence, showing off all the star power that he usually works overtime to hide."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,83,"In this quiet, absorbing, shades-of-gray drama, a kind of thriller meditation on the schism in Northern Ireland, we get the story of not one but two powerfully opposing heroes."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,80,"As a well-directed star vehicle with a couple of good action sequences, this is good, effective filmmaking, but I was periodically bored; when Ford and Pitt aren't lighting up the screen nothing much happens."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,75,That the would-be buddies are played by Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt ensures enough star power to keep things moving even during the sluggish early scenes that set up their relationship.
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,70,"The Devil's Own is neither the best nor the worst $90 million-$100 million-area budgeted picture ever made, but it must be the one in which the cost is least evident on the screen."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,70,What makes it worth the price of admission is the energetic performance Ford pulls off in the cookie-cutter role of big-city cop.
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,67,"The script, partly written by an uncredited Terry George (""Some Mother's Son,"" ""In the Name of the Father"") strains mightily for insight but never quite breaks through."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,63,The moral reasoning in the film is so confusing that only by completely sidestepping it can the plot work at all.
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,63,"Part of the reason The Devil's Own is endurable is because, in spite of various script deficiencies, both of the stars -- Pitt and Harrison Ford -- have an undeniable screen presence. And, while star power can't save a sinking movie, it can at least keep it afloat longer."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,63,The emphasis on character in Rambo scribe Kevin Jarre's screenplay (aided by Vincent Patrick and David Aaron Cohen) gives the film unexpected maturity.
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,60,"Even though The Devil's Own reportedly cost close to $100 million, it comes across as a sleek, medium-grade character study occasionally punctuated by gunfire. If this is what $100 million buys these days, can $200-million movies be very far off?"
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,60,A topical thriller that manages to be watchable despite director Alan J. Pakula's best efforts to take all the fun out of it.
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,60,"As in all fiercely realistic thrillers, the action becomes less and less credible as it speeds on. But, as with some such thrillers, we tolerate the incredible as the price of the pulse-quickening."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,60,"An earnest, thoughtful, surprisingly well-written (given the number of writers who worked on it) drama about guilt and betrayal that features excellent performances by Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt and dares to defy the juvenile wham bam thank you ma'am aesthetics that have turned mainstream action pictures into feature-length video games."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,50,"Pitt and Ford try to dig deeper, but the script undercuts them with preachy dialogue that might as well read, ""Insert stereotype here."""
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,50,"The dramatic situations aren't intense or knotty enough to match the moral issues behind them, however."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,50,"Hobbled by a schizoid desire to make a deep human drama on the one hand and a blistering IRA shoot-'em-up on the other, Alan Pakula's new movie is less a story than a plodding sequence of debates punctuated by gunfire."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,50,"With two of the world's biggest stars in tow, the creators of The Devil's Own can be forgiven for figuring that nothing else really mattered. If you've got Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt, do you really need a coherent script? Unfortunately for everyone concerned, the answer is yes."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,50,"Certainly, whatever surgery the script doctors performed, it didn't take. The limp result is a picture that is epic in intention and Lilliputian everywhere else."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,50,This movie is only really interesting during the moments of physical conflict that pop up throughout the film. These few scenes are well executed and riveting as hell.
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,40,"The Devil's Own isn't the disaster its bad advance publicity might lead you to expect. But it's a disjointed, sluggish picture."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,40,"The film features plot turns of howling implausibility, leading up to a mechanical climax that resolves the story without forcing either of the principal characters to make the uncommercial decision to blow the other away."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,40,"Ford's earthy Everyman and Pitt's vengeful youth are probably more interesting than they have any right to be inside these tired macho roles. Of course, Rory and Tom could be bursting with blarney and the movie still wouldn't gather any momentum."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,20,"The Devil's Own, which stars Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt, is so epically awful, it's practically homeric."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III,4.8,42660000,60,"This Ninja Turtles tale is less violent and more scenic than its predecessors, since it gets the title characters out of the sewer and transports them back to feudal Japan."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III,4.8,42660000,50,"These fun-loving mutants meet life on their own terms, they are heroes despite themselves. Their appeal is apparently strong enough to overcome any potential disturbance regarding plot disjointedness, pseudo-scientific reasoning and historical inaccuracy."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III,4.8,42660000,50,Smashingly stupid.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III,4.8,42660000,50,This may be the easiest installment in the series for parents to sit through.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III,4.8,42660000,50,"This third--and, at $30 million, most expensive--go-around gamely attempts to jump-start the viewer's interest with the canny switch of locations (and centuries), but the new recipe can't change the fact that this Turtle soup has grown cold."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III,4.8,42660000,50,"If the first sequel was a photocopy of the original, this second sequel is a tracing of a photocopy. It's the same business twice removed, and twice diminished."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III,4.8,42660000,50,"The music is overbearing, the camera and lighting too bright and obvious, and the production design borders on the cheesy. Performances range from competent to just plain embarrassing."
Beverly Hills Cop III,5.5,42610000,60,"Landis's handling of the cop business is unnecessarily laborious, but Murphy's patented insincerity is winning. And a few of the slapstick set pieces are genuinely thrilling, especially a riotous nighttime chase scene."
Beverly Hills Cop III,5.5,42610000,50,"The comedy is mostly restricted to one-liners, some of which aren't funny. And the action is uninspired, barely tapping the vast potential of an amusement park chase film."
Beverly Hills Cop III,5.5,42610000,50,"Beverly Hills Cop III is a flat-out action comedy in which the action is unimpressive and the comedy so mild it seldom hits the mark; for a series only into its third installment, Beverly Hills Cop III is shockingly toothless."
Beverly Hills Cop III,5.5,42610000,50,"It's now become Hollywood gospel that if a high concept film is reasonably successful, then make a sequel and if that raises any interest at all, then, hey why not try one more. It's a shame that here the studios just don't know when to stop with this episode ruining the name of what was once an enjoyable franchise."
Beverly Hills Cop III,5.5,42610000,40,"Though not quite the fiasco of revved-up gunplay that Beverly Hills Cop II was, this new movie, directed by John ''Rock-'em Sock-'em'' Landis, is just a clunky action thriller, with occasional comic moments rationed out to the audience like stray crumbs."
Beverly Hills Cop III,5.5,42610000,38,"Whatever juice is left in the ""Cop"" franchise or in the once unstoppable career of Eddie Murphy peters out ignominiously in this poor excuse for a sequel."
Beverly Hills Cop III,5.5,42610000,33,"Beverly Hills Cop III is a generic action movie, an Eddie Murphy film with only a trace of Eddie Murphy."
Beverly Hills Cop III,5.5,42610000,25,"Beverly Hills Cop III is made with so little spark, humor, and internal logic that it makes me better appreciate these other recent Murphy movies where the actor/comedian at least stretched his persona and attempted something apart from the action comedy mold."
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,88,"At this point in the franchise, Anderson is content to alight the saga on a perpetual rewind loop, ever-ending, ever-rebooting, all subsidized by his nonpareil compositional sense."
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,67,Writer-director W.S. Anderson's overseeing of the Resident Evil zombie franchise has proven to be both lunatically haphazard and dementedly enthusiastic.
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,60,Anderson utilizes slow-motion 3-D to hyperbolic effect while again casting Jovovich as the epitome of badass sexiness.
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,60,"If it's true that movies can transport you to places you could hardly have imagined, then Resident Evil: Retribution is the cinema's ultimate passport to purgatory."
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,50,"Even devoted fans may wonder whether this installment is actually a haphazard patchwork of outtakes from previous ""Resident Evil"" pictures."
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,50,"At this point, the Resident Evil movie franchise has become a personal playground for husband-and-wife team Paul W.S. Anderson and Milla Jovovich; every few years, they find another excuse to pit Jovovich's videogame-inspired dark superhero, Alice, against zombies and other gruesome monsters."
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,50,It's the closest thing you'll find yet to a recreation of a video game sensibility on the big screen - which is in line with the franchise's source material - and makes for a memorably unsettling if not particularly satisfying viewing experience.
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,40,"Giant brains with teeth, suburban mutant zombies, more bullets than a John Woo film festival, and hot girls in skin-tight S&M outfits pummelling each other to a deafening dubstep soundtrack. If you're looking for brainless, blood-guzzling carnage, you've found it."
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,40,"Jovovich's physicality and chilly mien (she was originally a ""project"" of the Umbrella Corp.) carry the series from start to … whenever it finishes, which might not be for quite a while yet."
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,40,"Taking place almost entirely inside computer-simulated global locations, ""Retribution"" moves closer than ever to its airless video game roots."
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,40,"Anderson['s] lavish visual imagination is matched to a placeholder idea of character that's almost avant-garde in its generic stylization, dialogue buffed of personality by passing through 10,000 previous movies."
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,40,"As always, Jovovich's game face is admirable - whether giving gunslinger shade or play-acting a protective mother storyline straight-outta-Cameron. But it can't be easy when all around her are line readings that recall the glory days of baroquely dull foreign-movie dubbing."
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,38,"Funny about retribution, though - it's a tricky thing to make time for when you've still got mutant zombie hordes after you. The real premise turns out to be a busy rehash of the first movie's story line."
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,38,"A few striking images keep our attention – like evil warrior Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) seated menacingly with an assault rifle on a playground swing in the 'burbs. But the film's title promises payback, without offering ample compensation."
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,30,"She's (Milla Jovovich) constantly being besieged by a seemingly never-ending series of monsters, and we -- at least every couple of years or so -- are forced to sit through yet another installment of the mind-numbing series."
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,20,Thuddingly awful.
Resident Evil: Retribution,5.4,42345531,16,"It's a testament to the movie's lack of creativity that Anderson can't even rip off ""Aliens"" and have it come across as anything less than totally boring."
Bullitt,7.5,42300873,100,"McQueen is great in Bullitt, and the movie is great, because director Peter Yates understands the McQueen image and works within it. He winds up with about the best action movie of recent years."
Bullitt,7.5,42300873,100,"Blessed with the fresh eyes of newly landed Englishman Yates (and genius cameraman William Fraker), the movie makes San Francisco fresh and alive, but also completely remakes and modernises the bleak, sleazy gangster demimonde in which Bullitt does his hunting."
Bullitt,7.5,42300873,100,"It is simply one of the most exciting and intelligent action films in years, probably the best good-cop film we can expect to encounter."
Bullitt,7.5,42300873,100,"Conflict between police sleuthing and political expediency is the essence of Bullitt, an extremely well-made crime melodrama [from Robert L. Pike's novel Mute Witness] filmed in Frisco. Steve McQueen delivers a very strong performance as a detective seeking a man whom Robert Vaughn, ambitious politico, would exploit for selfish motives. Good scripting and excellent direction by Peter Yates maintain deliberately low-key but mounting suspense."
Bullitt,7.5,42300873,100,"Expert chase film, breathless and modern, that sent McQueen to the top of the box office heap. Bullitt is a return to the old, tough crime movies so expertly played by Bogart and Robinson, but made modern here by great technical advances and McQueen's taciturn, antihero stance. Yates's superb direction presents a fluid, always moving camera. All the performers are top-notch."
Bullitt,7.5,42300873,100,"One of the cinema’s very best car-chase sequences – set amid the hilly, windy San Francisco streets – caps this quintessential Steve McQueen policier."
Bullitt,7.5,42300873,90,"A terrific movie, just right for Steve McQueen—fast, well acted, written the way people talk."
Bullitt,7.5,42300873,80,"The plot, concerning the battle of wits between an honest cop and an ambitious politician for possession of the key witness in a Mafia exposé, is serviceable but nothing special. But the action sequences are brilliant, done without trickery in real locations (including a great car chase which spawned a thousand imitations) to lend an extraordinary sense of immediacy to the shenanigans and gunfights."
Bullitt,7.5,42300873,70,"Not to go all Pauline Kael on you, but Bullitt -- the 1968 crime drama starring a Ford Mustang GT390 and some guy named Steve McQueen -- is a fairly tedious bit of Aquarian cinema: the chicka-chicka-waah soundtrack, the inscrutable plot, the anaerobic dullness of every second that McQueen is off-camera. Bullitt scrabbles to its minor footnote status in film history on two counts. The first: It marks the only time any man ever looked cool in a cardigan -- McQueen should have gotten the academy's knitwear award. The second is the movie's remarkable seven-minute chase scene, with real cars (the Mustang and a black Dodge Charger), real drivers and real stunts, no special effects."
Bullitt,7.5,42300873,70,"Peter Yates-directed cop thriller that relies on McQueen's chiseled features to hold an audience's attention through what's essentially a 45-minute TV show stretched to two hours. Aside from the famous car chase through the streets of San Francisco, Bullitt is primarily watchable for McQueen's performance as a cop breaking the rules to break a case, as well as all the '68 cinema signifiers: lens flares, soft-focus foregrounds, a jazzy Lalo Schifrin score, and vivid location shooting."
Bullitt,7.5,42300873,70,"Steve McQueen as a tres chic San Francisco cop, though the real star is his sports car. There isn't much here, and what there is is awfully easy. With Jacqueline Bisset, Robert Vaughn, Robert Duvall, and a chase sequence that achieved classic status mainly by going on too long; Peter Yates directed this 1968 feature."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,83,"In an era of high-falutin’ tentpole sci-fi, there’s something to be said for a filmmaker still devoted to crafting plain old genre pleasures."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,75,"It’s nothing new for sure, but writer/director David Twohy...throws in enough entertaining touches to maintain interest — despite an overlong two-hour running time."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,75,Riddick isn't perfect but it's a good high-octane sci-fi tinged action/thriller.
Riddick,6.4,42025135,75,"The quickest and easiest way to humanize an unlikeable movie character is to give him a lovable dog, and so it goes with Riddick."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,75,"It's fun! Extremely violent, cleverly managed fun, full of eviscerating aliens."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,70,"There’s one man alone, stranded on a seemingly desolate distant planet with only his wits, his fists and his voice-over.  That voice-over is mercifully spare, the landscape atmospherically barren and the action nice and tight."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,70,"An improbable but very enjoyable sequel that recaptures much of the stripped-down intensity of Diesel and director David Twohy’s franchise starter ""Pitch Black."""
Riddick,6.4,42025135,67,"While ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" was an overstuffed melange of CGI and unnecessary subplots, Riddick is a far more streamlined affair, and all the better for it."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,67,"Riddick, as a character, is best when he's alone, fighting against insurmountable odds, with narratives that serve his singular nastiness."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,64,"Riddick is a fractured skeleton of a script, with each distinct installment scratching its own itch."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,63,"The movie jogs along nicely without ever getting a case of the stupids; far from being a bloated “John Carter,” it’s just a pared-down yarn of survival: “Die Hard” on a planet."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,63,"Riddick can be cheesy and silly, not to mention excessively violent, but it’s also fun."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,63,Twohy's script contains macho dialogue so ripe it's embarrassing to hear it.
Riddick,6.4,42025135,60,"Riddick taps into a primal well of audience wish-fulfillment, but over the course of its unrelieved, monotonous length, it does its best to suck that well dry."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,60,"Riddick aims much lower than the stars and still doesn't quite hit its target. But when you consider a summer overstuffed with disappointing prestige pics that cost the GDP of several island nations to produce, Riddick's more modest (and less expensive) stumbling doesn't seem so bad in comparison."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,60,"Watching this see-in-the-dark muscleman brooding against gorgeous otherworldly vistas, all while crafting pointy homemade weapons and befriending a scene-stealing CGI canine (no joke), is a sci-fi aficionado's delight."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,60,"Overlong and often overcooked, this is nevertheless a relative return to form for Diesel as the fiendish Furyan."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,58,"At a time when the budgets for sci-fi films are, like the universe itself, expanding at an astronomical rate, Riddick decides to go small."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,50,"This is back-to-basics stuff, which turns out to be not such a bad idea."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,50,An alternately kick-ass and clumsy piece of sci-fi claptrap that puts its empty head down and gets the job done.
Riddick,6.4,42025135,50,"Purely as an action film, Riddick is passable, if grueling. The problem is tonal."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,50,"The results are by turns boring and bizarre, although Diesel still has some presence."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,50,"Playing it safe with a script that offers Riddick up as a lone avenging hero, Twohy passes on the opportunity to effectively shade the character’s distinctive dimensionality."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,40,"Too stodgy for B-movie suspense, too silly to shock, too sexist to stomach, Diesel’s return misfires."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,40,"The aliens are unscary and easily despatched, Vin’s too silent to be interesting, and the other characters – a gang of bounty hunters on Riddick’s trail – are either dull or offensive."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,40,"Like Vin Diesel, it has bulk, lumbering clumsily along as it repeats Diesel’s greatest hits — the ones that don’t require him to drive a fast and furious car."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,40,"As a result, we get relatively little insight into the other characters as they react to Riddick. Without an unknown force to spark our own imaginations, the result is mostly dead air."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,38,"The only reason to root for Riddick is that his name is on the ticket stub. But he's so dull and the hunters so weird that we're literally cheering for the movie to kill off its personality, one throat slash at a time."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,30,"Move along, there's nothing to see and no one to root for in this murky franchise reboot."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,30,"It's the film, though, that remains handcuffed. The early part of the story -- with Riddick stranded on an unfriendly planet -- is taut enough, but hampered by flagrantly unreal effects and Diesel's punch-drunk narration."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,25,The entire movie bears the whiff of a vanity project — a modestly budgeted bone Universal Pictures threw at Diesel so he would keep starring in Fast and Furious pictures. Those movies are bank; Riddick is rank.
Riddick,6.4,42025135,25,"For a film about a killing machine who can see at night, it's fittingly ironic that the film itself is, both narratively and visually, a dark, muddled mess."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,25,"The story feels like quicksand. Riddick, which couldn’t even qualify for proper summer movie placement, moves like Martian molasses and can’t present an action scene to save its life. You’ll wish you had Uncle Martin’s ability to speed people — not to mention awful movies — up."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,90,"As is common in a Frankenheimer picture, the plot lines get a bit tangled in Ronin, but the atmosphere is tense, the style impeccable."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,90,Ronin can be watched as appreciatively for its hard-boiled performances as for its visceral excitement.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,90,It's a welcome throwback to the days when the world didn't have to end or tanker trucks explode to get an action audience's attention.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,88,"Ronin manages to remain focused on the plot and the characters, even while staging increasingly complicated pyrotechnic set pieces and offering its share of white-knuckle moments."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,88,Ronin represents an exhilarating return to form for Frankenheimer.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,88,"What an impeccably crafted film this is -- slightly impoverished in theme, perhaps, but so rich everywhere else that it seems rude to notice."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,80,"A pleasurable throwback to the sort of gritty, low-tech international thriller that was a staple of the 1960s."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,75,I enjoyed the film on two levels: for its skill and its silliness.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,75,"Frankenheimer doesn't recapture the magic he once created in movies like ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" but he does cook up an effective thriller in the ""French Connection"" vein."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,70,"A film in which the mechanics of the plot are far less interesting, and vital, then the interior landscape of men who exist outside the law."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,70,Here's a strangely flawed and strangely satisfying movie.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,70,"After a while, you stop counting the chases -- they just get longer and louder, and it's like watching the revival of a forgotten art form; the fact that it's done with a minimum of special effects makes it all the more stirring."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,67,"It remains head and shoulders above what little competition there is by virtue of its stellar casting, editing, and above all, Frankenheimer's fluid, explosive direction."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,67,It's not just the crack stunt driving that makes Ronin such a welcome throwback; it's also the existential hardness of this thriller's motley band of mercenaries.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,60,"Frankenheimer pretty much ignores everything that's happened in the action and thriller genres since 1975, and mostly that's a good thing."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,60,"Ronin is well-made, but it's an act of connoisseurship for people who have given up on movies as an art form."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,60,"Unlike the ronin, the heroes of a Japanese legend, these guys are still searching for a story."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,50,"Although laced with adrenaline and flavored with noirish seasoning, John Frankenheimer's Ronin is a disappointingly conventional thriller."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,50,"Ronin eventually becomes tiresome, but the pairing of De Niro and Reno never gets old."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,50,The concept is intriguing and the car chases are pure adrenaline.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,50,"It has a gritty feel and a tight, methodical, one-thing-after-another tempo."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,50,Ronin shows the mark of a veteran hand and is entertaining in fits and starts.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,40,Not even supercool Robert De Niro can enliven this boring tale about a team of mercenary operatives.
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,70,"Culminates in a show-stopping action sequence set in midtown Manhattan, directed by Ms. Leder with crisp economy and furious energy."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,70,"Slick, gripping and largely believable."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,67,"By no means an embarrassment to the fledgling DreamWorks, The Peacemaker is instead a grand, noisy step in the right direction."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,63,"The chief terrorist is played nicely with war-weary desperation by Marcel Iures, a Romanian actor with the sucked-in cheeks and ennui of a Jeremy Irons."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,63,"It looks great. The technical credits are impeccable, and Clooney and Kidman negotiate assorted dangers skillfully. But it's mostly spare parts from other thrillers."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,60,"Mimi Leder directed Michael Schiffer's script, handling some of the action sequences deftly enough to promote the latent idea that people who don't speak English don't deserve to live."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,60,"What The Peacemaker doesn't do well, though it tries, is bring much in the way of emotion or character development to the table."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,58,The essential spark of surprise is missing. The mechanics of ''breathless'' suspense are blanketed by an atmosphere of creeping caution.
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,50,"Director Mimi Leder fills the mindless-action-movie quota quite stylishly. The trouble is, The Peacemaker thinks it has a mind."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,50,"Isn't much better or worse than the average James Bond movie, except, of course, that it doesn't have the cars, the gadgets, the girls, or Bond himself."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,50,"His (George Clooney) rugged good looks spell movie star, but his body language spells Don Knotts, without the wit."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,50,A ticket to terminal boredom.
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,40,Ruthlessly efficient and utterly predictable.
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,40,Most action movies are so confident of their automatic audience that they're no better than they have to be. The Peacemaker isn't half that good.
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,30,"An uncommonly dour and even grim action thriller that globetrots as diversely as a James Bond film but offers a very limited view politically, emotionally and dramatically."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,30,"Between them, Clooney and Kidman would still need a third party to work up a personality. In fairness to both, they aren't given much to work with."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,30,"It's big and loud, but this Peacemaker is still a dud."

Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,100,"It's a film filled with humor, charm, excitement and so many memorable images that many viewers will find themselves struggling to keep from blinking so as not to miss any of the eye-popping delights crammed into each overstuffed frame."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,80,"Valerian is a film to wallow in, not follow, and if you’re tuned to its extra-terrestrial wavelength, you wouldn’t cut a second."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,80,Valerian is at times so mind-meltingly beautiful and strange that I’m still not sure I didn’t just dream it all.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,75,"This is a movie that will make you scream – in confusion, in delight, in anger, in ecstasy. Sometimes all at once."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,75,A movie for science fiction fans who wish every minute of “Star Wars” was the cantina scene.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,75,"Are there rules on how to make a space epic? If there are, Luc Besson has certainly never heard them because in Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, he takes the genre upside down, gives it a shake and rattle, and delivers one of the most positively bonkers films of the year."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,75,"The difference between the film and its equally expensive contemporaries is Luc Besson's playful, childlike naïveté."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,70,"As a mogul, Besson doesn’t worry about pleasing his corporate masters. He and his visual effects supervisor, Scott Stokdyk, can expend all their energy on topping themselves and making each other laugh. The movie is like a wave that makes you want to yell, “Cowabunga!”"
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,70,Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets might well represent the apotheosis of Besson’s singularly loony brand of filmmaking. It’s bonkers and gorgeous and confusing and thrilling and tiring and overflowing with ideas.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,70,"“Valerian” manages to be both cutting-edge and delightfully old-school — the kind of wild, endlessly creative thrill ride that only the director of “Lucy” and “The Fifth Element” could deliver, constructed as an episodic series of missions, scrapes and near-misses featuring a mind-blowing array of environments and stunning computer-generated alien characters."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,68,"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets showcases plenty of cool creatures and ideas for sci-fi fans to savor, but if only the movie's central characters and their relationship were as exciting and interesting as all that impressive eye candy."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,67,"In building worlds as detailed and vivid as he’s done here, Besson has essentially allowed the setting to do what’s typically reserved for characters and stakes, and that’s to make us care."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,67,"The longer action scenes may not always rank with Besson’s early ’90s highlights (Léon: The Professional, La Femme Nikita) or the mania of the more recent Lucy, but there isn’t a moment in this ludicrous, lushly self-indulgent movie that doesn’t feel like its creator is having the time of his life."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,67,The first 25 minutes of this movie should be mounted as an installation at the Louvre and played on an infinite loop. Only then can our planet know peace.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,63,"In the end, Besson’s Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets is a mixed bag: a ripe visual adventure of limitless imagination hamstrung by an undercooked plot propelled by lackluster heroes."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,63,"On a purely visual level, Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets deserves mention among the most technically accomplished works of those three. But as a complete motion picture experience, it falls considerably short."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,63,"In short, Besson builds a dazzling alterna-universe — a bit of Terry Gilliam, a dash of “Blade Runner,” a smidgen of “Star Wars” (which, to be fair, was probably influenced by the original comic), and a lot of extra-strength Besson-ian whimsy. And then he strands us with the two least interesting people there."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,60,"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets is a luxurious, appealingly daffy spectacle, a true vision unchecked by the standards of good taste, and that in and of itself is a quality worth savoring. But its design is pixel-deep, without the underlying thought that makes great science fiction worth revisiting."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,60,"Besson, an industrial-strength entertainer and the reigning maximalist of the European film industry, isn’t selling originality so much as volume. He has made a madly overstuffed Mos Eisley Cantina of a movie, one that surveys its diverse alien constituencies with the wide-eyed wonderment of a small child and the attention span to boot."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,60,"This is welcome summer fare; if we’re going to have space operas, let them sing in the strangest accents possible."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,60,"The latest from the French filmmaker is a dazzling feast of spectacular visuals and exhilarating set pieces. It’s Besson’s most ambitious film to date, and the most original big-budget adventure you’ll see on screen this season. But such ambition doesn’t always come without flaws."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,55,"Valerian isn’t a movie about plot, characters, or action; it’s a movie about places. True to its comic book roots, the larger arc exists to draw viewers into the beautiful, far-flung corners of Alpha. This makes it strangely episodic for a film, but also refreshingly light on complicated lore."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,Seldom has such a glittering wagon been hitched to such dull stars.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,Valerian has some cool visuals. But there’s more to science fiction than pretty pictures.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,It's as gorgeous as anything the French filmmaker has made and as empty as a Trump tweet.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"The story is ridiculous, the digressions many, but it’s all intended to be part of the fun. Like Besson’s ""The Fifth Element,"" we’re mainly meant to enjoy the sensation of watching wacky green-screen worlds unfold before us."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"Besson's commercial instincts for sleek, violent fantasy are often sound, but ""Valerian"" is more sedative than show."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"At its best, it hits the gut with the free-fall feel of a theme-park ride. But it’s a long and winding path back to the gate, and “Valerian” loses its way many times, however beautifully."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,The result is a visually fantastic but sometimes exasperating entertainment that (once again) gets lost in its own chaos. It’s one funned-up spectacle of a movie.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"Workshop the story, script-doctor the dialogue and recast the lovely leads with actors who generate a little actual sexual heat and Besson might have had another “Fifth Element,” a minor classic on his hands."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"Twenty years after The Fifth Element, writer-director Luc Besson has once again delivered a widescreen, sci-fi spectacle full of rampant whimsy, lavish effects and creaky social commentary, resulting in a nervy, go-for-broke opus whose audacity is more laudable than its execution."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"Even if the movie is based on an existing property, a beloved French graphic novel, as a producer and designer, Besson should be lauded; ‘Valerian’ is out of this world. But next time, he might want to reread the comic for its characters, checking the little word bubbles to see if there’s actually something there."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,48,Valerian wants to be weird and sexy but just won’t let itself.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,42,"During the film’s intoxicating first 30 minutes, for example, I couldn’t decide whether what I was watching was brilliantly bonkers or total folly. Then, as the story went on, it came into sharper and sharper focus: Valerian is an epic mess."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,40,"There is no soul, and no heart to the story. A good sci-fi is never merely about the effects, it's about the plot, character and thoughts they bring to life, all of which Valerian lacks in abundance."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,40,"A wildly ambitious space opera, but also a self-indulgent narrative morass. Sometimes, it seems, creativity can benefit from a few limitations."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,40,"To say that “Valerian” is a science-fiction epic doesn’t quite do it justice. Imagine crushing a DVD of “The Phantom Menace” into a fine powder, tossing in some Adderall and Ecstasy and a pinch of cayenne pepper and snorting the resulting mixture while wearing a virtual reality helmet in a Las Vegas karaoke bar. Actually, that sounds like too much fun, but you get the idea."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,40,Valerian And The City Of A Thousand Planets is a fantasy adventure that’s nowhere near as adventurous or fantastical as it should be.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,40,"It never stops for a minute, yet it never goes anywhere. And much as it promises to take you to a thousand planets, it can’t find one sign of intelligent life."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,38,"Sure, the pricey special effects are impressive to behold (though, as usually the case, the 3D is nothing to text home about). And yes, at times “Valerian” creates a strange and beautiful universe. Which ultimately means nothing, because the plot is paper-thin."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,37,"""Valerian” is an expensive, handsome but dozy invalid of a movie."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,25,Valerian displays reckless imagination and zero personality.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,25,"If you’re going to call your sci-fi movie Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, you’d better be sure Valerian (Dane DeHaan) is a guy your audience can get behind. Director Luc Besson styles him as a cocky space rogue, but Valerian is weak sauce. And so is this movie."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,25,There is absolutely nothing new under the many suns in Besson’s universe. This is a voyage not worth taking.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,20,At no point along the way does the film provide a reason to invest your interest in any of this.
Clash of the Titans,6.9,41092328,88,"Clash of the Titans is a grand and glorious romantic adventure, filled with grave heroes, beautiful heroines, fearsome monsters, and awe-inspiring duels to the death. It is a lot of fun."
Clash of the Titans,6.9,41092328,75,"These fantastical He-Man epics were common in the early ’80s (Legend, Conan the Barbarian, and The Beastmaster were all variations of the same theme), and while Clash of the Titans remains one of the genre’s homelier entries, there’s no faulting a film this lovingly and aptly arcane."
Clash of the Titans,6.9,41092328,70,"The effects might not hold up, but the performances by the likes of Smith, Olivier and other classically trained British actors, as well as Ursula Andress, elevate this to something more than a throwaway fantasy adventure from the early '80s."
Clash of the Titans,6.9,41092328,60,"Clash of the Titans is profligate in its use of talented people who are not particularly at home in this sort of film, though they all pay serious attention to their work."
Clash of the Titans,6.9,41092328,50,"Despite its general failure, some scenes from Clash of the Titans remain memorable. Chief among them is the duel with Medusa, a scene that ripples with tension."
Clash of the Titans,6.9,41092328,50,"Titans forces all aspects of the movie except the spectacle into the background, and historical accuracy isn't much of a concern. It does feature a better-than-average cast, however, aside from uncharismatic star Harry Hamlin."
Clash of the Titans,6.9,41092328,50,"Clash of the Titans is an unbearable bore that will probably put to sleep the few adults stuck taking the kids to it. Desmond Davis directs with a tired hand, not helped much by the lackadaisical writing."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,100,"Mythic, thrilling and brilliantly made motion picture."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,100,"The best scenes are filmed inside the cruiser, dashboard shots that face inward instead of out, catching Gyllenhaal and Peña in moments so playful and true they make all other buddy cops look bogus by comparison."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,100,"One of the best police movies in recent years, a virtuoso fusion of performances and often startling action."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,91,"Nerve-rattling in the best way, the sharp, visceral urban police procedural End of Watch is one of the best American cop movies I've seen in a long time."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,88,"David Ayer, the writer of ""Training Day,"" director of ""Street Kings,"" writer/director of ""Harsh Times,"" does not make movies about princesses with witchy curses, about yuppie commitment-phobes, about talking plush toys. His territory is narrow, but he owns it: cops, in Los Angeles."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,88,"The problem with End of Watch, a gripping police drama, is director David Ayer's stylistic decision to shoot nearly the entire movie tripod-less. Or, to put it another way, there's a whole lotta shakin' going on."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,83,"I wish that the Mexican drug cartel subplot was not so overwrought and Oliver Stone-ish, and the decision to shoot much of the film ""Cops""-style is also problematic. But the film puts you right inside an everyday inferno and, to its credit, doesn't turn down the heat."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"It's a collection of cop-movie clichés but presented with sufficient flair and strong performances that the ride is enough, even if it's on rails."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"There's nothing in David Ayer's cop drama End of Watch that you haven't already seen, but the film has moments so riveting that you might not care too much."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"End of Watch is one thriller where the adrenaline rush, considerable as it is, is almost always put in the service of character. Happily, the character on display turns out to be considerable, too."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"A visceral story of beat cops that is rare in its sensitivity, rash in its violence and raw in its humor."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"If Ayer had taken as much care with his bad guys as he does with his leads (and their deftly sketched wives and colleagues, played by Anna Kendrick, America Ferrera and Frank Grillo, among others), he might have crafted a seamless picture."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"As social insight, End of Watch is useless, but as engrossing entertainment, it's irresistible, thanks to Ayer's gift for dialogue, the relentless pacing set by film editor Dody Dorn, and gorgeous performances by Gyllenhaal and Peña."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"The action and the chemistry is stronger than the story, because Gyllenhaal and Peña are good. In that respect End of Watch works better as a series of vignettes held together somewhat loosely by a larger story."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,Easily one of the year's best films and one of the best ever in the well-worn cop genre.
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"Ultimately, the mock-doc device works because Gyllenhaal and Pena so completely reinvent themselves in-character. Instead of wearing the roles like costumes or uniforms, they let the job seep into their skin, a feat without which ""End of Watch's"" pseudo-reality never would have worked."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"America Ferrara (""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants'') turns in an image-changing role as a tough lesbian officer who develops a grudging admiration for our heroes."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,75,"The two cops are cocky and funny and young, and it still takes a good half hour to accept that they may be as forthright and dedicated to their jobs as they appear to be."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,75,"Unlike many action thrillers where the viewer is fairly certain that no real harm can come to the protagonists, such is never the case here. In this gritty ride-along, we sense that anything can happen, which adds to the propulsive momentum of a riveting story."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,75,"A muscular, maddening exploitation movie embellished with art-house style and anchored by solid performances."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,70,"In the last 15 minutes of the film, he burns up some of the credibility he established by not pushing extreme situations too far earlier on."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,70,"End of Watch is more than the sum of its parts, though; it ends on a downbeat note, but that's something I've come to expect from Ayer."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,67,"It's powerful stuff, but I almost felt like I needed an intermission."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,63,End of Watch gives you the savage whoosh of being on a job that can get you killed. Sins of cop clichés can be forgiven when a movie pays honest tribute to police on the line.
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,63,"The camera is just everywhere, from the point of view of everything. When I left the movie the other night, people complained of seasickness."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,63,"No doubt, these twin saviours are a likeable tandem, and they bear their cross lightly. Still, End of Watch suffers from no end of sanctimony. Sainthood is all well and fine but it ain't drama and, on screen at least, the question cries out: Where's a corrupt cop when you need him?"
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,63,"The drawback of the film's visual approach, however, is a considerable one. The relentless first-person shooting in End of Watch - figurative and literal - is less about YouTube factuality than it is about Xbox gaming reconfigured for the movies."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,63,"Forceful and arresting, Ayer's follow-up to ""Harsh Times"" and ""Street Kings"" sees him confidently playing to his strengths."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,60,"Gyllenhaal and Peña's relationship, a sort of heterosexual love affair, is depicted with a sense of tenderness and care that does not extend to the cartoonish villains that dominate the film's lackluster final act."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,58,"By virtue of its style and high stakes scenario, End of Watch is impressively tense, but then so are most episodes of ""COPS,"" which don't suffer from the forced melodrama found here."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,58,The performances here are so sharp that viewers may wish End of Watch has been shot by someone who knew how to find the right point of view for a scene and leave it there.
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,50,"Shallow down inside, End of Watch is a music-video Frappuccino of quick cuts, sparkling banter, serial crises, grisly violence and tongue-jerk profanity. But the film is exciting, in its manipulative way, and exhausting."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,50,"It almost becomes comical to count the number of ""who's holding the camera now?"" reverse shots that the filmmaker haphazardly inserts to propel the story forward. Such visual ineptitude, like much else in this tediously cocky enterprise, is downright criminal."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,40,"Despite the violence and procedural detail, this is about as gritty as Dixon of Dock Green."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,40,"End of Watch is pure frat-boy fantasy, the video game to Southland's great American novel."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,38,"End of Watch is a repellent movie, first for its shaky-cam conceit rendering much of the action incomprehensible, and finally for seeking to entertain viewers through the thuggish execution of a police officer."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,88,"It's a thinking person's thriller, where pyrotechnics give way to plot, character development supplants fight scenes, and adrenaline does not short-circuit intelligence."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,80,"A political thriller with more plausibility -- and yes, more thrills -- than most."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,70,An intramural debate masquerading as an action movie.
The Siege,6.3,40981289,70,"What a shame, therefore, that in its puritanical treatment of the only strong female character, the otherwise politically correct police story is blithely unaware of its own closet misogyny."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,70,"A political film in the form of a thriller, rather than a garden-variety potboiler gleefully helping itself to stock political tropes from the genre's grab bag."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,67,"It's a cautionary tale about the excesses of jingoist paranoia, and the folly of it all is that the more the film descends into somber liberal chest thumping, the less engrossing it becomes."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,63,"The Siege is not a documentary but a glossy Hollywood entertainment that is prey to all the exaggerations, simplifications and acting histrionics that come with the genre."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,63,"In its clumsy way, it throws in comments now and then to show it knows the difference between Arab terrorists and American citizens."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,60,"If The Siege frustrates anyone, it should be the moviegoers who turn up expecting the kind of clean resolution that action movies thrive on."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,60,A potentially provocative idea is played out to diminishing returns.
The Siege,6.3,40981289,60,Edward Zwick's ultimately sedate thriller starts out with crisply efficient style and the potential for a much more involving story.
The Siege,6.3,40981289,60,"The problem, as always, is that when you try to mix cliches with more complicated data it's often the cliches that win out."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,"As a nail-biting thriller, The Siege is too confusing, and as a thought-provoking social drama, too confused."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,"At some point, the movie itself crosses the line, from a modestly thoughtful attempt to extrapolate a drama from real and urgent events to a generic action piece with predictable good and bad guys and pat, civics-book morals."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,"This is a dumb action flick that pretends to have a brain, a spot of affectation that plunges the audience into double jeopardy -- forcing us to traipse through not just the standard litter of bloody corpses but (oh, damn) the added trash of bloodless ideas."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,Zwick frequently sacrifices dramatic urgency in the name of sobriety.
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,"The good news, then, is that The Siege is hardly the ticking time bomb of racial slurs some would have you imagine, and the bad news is that it doesn't matter because it's all too damn pedantically serious to take seriously."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,"Most of the fault rests with the script, which gets to this issue late and feels only perfunctory, more interested in the jolt of the image than the jolt of the idea."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,A sometimes gripping but mostly routine shoot-em-up about Muslim terrorism in American.
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,"It's one of those fast, slick, half-smart shows that can't decide whether to pay its debts to action or reality -- and winds up cheating both."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,"The story is an odd mixture of preachiness and paranoia, but the stars provide sizzling performances and the action moves at a lively clip."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,"The filmmakers peddle fear and then try to claim the moral high ground; the treatment is foolish, confused, and borderline irresponsible."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,40,The pre-posterous plot is a far-fetched way to dis-cuss the power and meaning of the Consti-tution in the context of international terror-ism.
The Siege,6.3,40981289,30,This echo of the WWII internment of Japanese-Americans is the only new gimmick in Edward Zwick's entry in the cliche- terrorist genre.
The Siege,6.3,40981289,25,"In an attempt to be complex and fair-minded, a simple story becomes a jumble of confused motivations."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,90,"Despite some of the sentimentality that is also Woo's stock-in-trade, I was moved and absorbed throughout."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,88,"It's the best new battle film since ""Black Hawk Down,"" a movie it surpasses in sheer feeling and bravura style, if not in nightmarish panic and suspense."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,83,"Cage is superb as a hollowed-out, ferocious man of action chasing his demons recklessly with machine gun firing away."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,80,"Well matched both to the material and each other, Cage and Beach capture Windtalkers' true struggle, the fight to hold on to values like honor, friendship, and tenderness in an environment that demands otherwise. This is as much a Woo trademark as the carefully orchestrated gunplay."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,80,"Windtalkers is the best of Woo's American movies, and the one with the sturdiest and most direct links to his earlier pictures."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,70,"Imaginative and frequently thrilling, and the love-hate relationship of its protagonists is quite compelling; Woo is always at his best in portraying the complexities of male bonding under intense pressure and violence."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,67,"Windtalkers blows this way and that, but there's no mistaking the filmmaker in the tall grass, true to himself."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,67,"Capably made and certainly impresses by carrying its length, but it doesn't expand 60 years of World War II screen literature by very much."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,63,"The result is that the film comes across as preachy and clichéd. And, while the battle sequences are well executed from a technical point-of-view, they often seem repetitive and uninspired."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,63,"The code talkers and their guardians - Beach and Cage, Willie and Slater - do the best they can with the oddly flat-footed script, but their dynamics don't really have a place in Woo's universe."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,63,"While I don't always have the stomach for Woo's viscera or the heart for his pure, angelic heroes and impure, diabolical villains, I found myself responding to the context and subtext of Windtalkers while closing my eyes through what one might call its text. It's two-thirds of a great film."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,63,"Windtalkers is to movies what Paris is to weather -- if you don't like the show you're watching, just wait a minute and an entirely different picture will blow into view."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,63,This is the kind of film where you think you can predict everything thats going to happen upon the first shot and you spend the rest of the film praying that youre wrong. But its fun getting there.
Windtalkers,6,40914068,63,"Not all it might have been, an oddly old-fashioned film from a director who's usually anything but."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,60,"We can only view Windtalkers with the same shaken detachment that characterizes Mr. Cage's Joe Enders, wishing that the codetalkers' real story, a little known and fascinating chunk of American history, had been given its true dramatic import."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,50,"Despite some feints in a soulful direction, the picture has none of the interior quality of a multifaceted war film like Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line."" Woo is all about elegant surfaces, not inner conflicts."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,50,"For all this potential, and the appealing presence of Nicolas Cage and newcomer Adam Beach, Windtalkers remains almost obstinately flat."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,50,"The movie deals superficially with Native American pride and racism in the ranks, but it's hardly about the codetalkers at all: Neither Woo nor the screenwriting team of Joe Batteer and John Rice seem to appreciate the bitter irony in a Native American soldier protecting his land by serving the very government that took most of it from him in the first place."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,50,"Know how to tell if a war movie is mediocre? An outspoken bigot, usually a Southerner, abuses a patient member of an oppressed minority -- the Asian recruit, the African American or, in the case of Windtalkers, a pair of Navajo men from Arizona in his platoon."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,50,"Gets pinned down in a barrage of schmaltz, cliché, stereotype and racial condescension - not to mention a historically dubious premise."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,50,The Navajo code talkers have waited a long time to have their story told. Too bad it appears here merely as a gimmick in an action picture.
Windtalkers,6,40914068,50,The code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute.
Windtalkers,6,40914068,50,Cage is the only reason to check out an otherwise mediocre movie.
Windtalkers,6,40914068,50,"The script is riddled with so many clichés, you count on the battle scenes to wake you from your stupor."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,50,Woo could end up becoming the John Ford of schmaltz.
Windtalkers,6,40914068,50,"Woo's mainstreaming his vision here, and though Windtalkers has its moments of precious, awful clarity, it can't hold a candle to the man's earlier blood-soaked balletics."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,50,"A powerful premise turned into a stubbornly flat, derivative war movie."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,50,"At once chintzy and grandiose, awash in battlefield sentimentality and platoon clichés."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,40,"In the studied excess of his Hong Kong action movies, Woo's swooning sentimentality plays like grand opera. With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood, Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap."
Windtalkers,6,40914068,40,"This is a great subject for a movie, but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity, using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,80,"Making excellent use of Nolte's controlled toughness and Short's hysterical freneticism, Weber plays the comic action hard and fast, grounding the humour in believable reality that has spiralled out of control."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,70,"Despite its herky-jerky pace and aimlessness of plot, Three Fugitives is engaging sport, primarily enjoyable for the hearty teamwork of Nolte and Short -- a comedic contretemps as bruising as a Punch and Judy show."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,63,"Given such a cloying and utterly predictable plot, it's surprising that Three Fugitives works as well as it does. Nolte, all big shoulders and bashfulness shows a pleasant self-deprecating talent and copes very well with the array of humiliations ranged against him."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,60,"As for the Nolte-Short pairing, it’ll do, but it’s no chemical marvel. Nolte, not really a comic natural, gruffs and grumbles his way through as hunky straight man to Short’s calamitous comedian."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,60,"This comedy has the earmarks of humor and even a few genuine laughs, but it also has a prefabricated, automatic-pilot feeling."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,50,"This obvious attempt to tap into the same audience that flocked to THREE MEN AND A BABY (indeed, it could have been titled ""Two Men and a Toddler"") is about as lifeless as they come. Not only is THREE FUGITIVES a scene-for-scene remake of Veber's French original, it is actually shot for shot the same film. Not surprisingly, the resulting film feels mechanical, despite engaging performances from Short and Nolte."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,50,"Nick Nolte and Martin Short make a frequently hilarious odd couple, but the film itself is shamelessly sentimental and often slapdash."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,50,"It would be wrong to blame Martin Short alone for the failure of Three Fugitives. Francis Veber, the French filmmaker who wrote and directed the film, must accept much of the responsibility."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,50,The film never adequately uses either the dramatic talents of Nolte nor the comic talents of Short. The young girl (Sarah Rowland Doroff) is most effective because she rarely speaks.
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,40,"Francis Veber's Three Fugitives, a heist caper, starts off with comic promise then limps all the way from the bank."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,75,For Friday night this will do just fine. It's definitely a good matchup -- Stone's cynical bravado versus Berry's resilient spunkiness in a world-class cat fight.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,70,"Not everybody will be able to swallow its heady romanticism, yet its French director, Pitof, has brought sophistication to a comic book sensibility, which helps some purple patches of dialogue along with other absurdities."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,67,"I wouldn't call Catwoman incompetent, yet it has no visual grandeur, and very little surprise; you can tick off the story beats as if they'd been graphed."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,50,"Much like a cat, the movie is a superfluous gob of fluff with an attitude ranging from idiotic to nasty."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,50,"The result is not the train wreck one might anticipate from surfing the Net. The catfights, overacting and Berry's swagger in a skimpy, tight, leather outfit that would be right at home at a Hookers Ball make for campy fun."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,42,"Berry has no character to play, but Sharon Stone's an over-the-top hoot."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,40,The lure of Halle Berry as the leather-clad feline should help this mangy misfire claw out a decent opening before a quick slink to DVD.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,40,"Overall, though, the film drags at 91 minutes, filled with dead air that should be crackling with pulp energy."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,40,The frustrating thing about Catwoman is that Berry does her damnedest to make the character work. Some of her physical moves are astonishing: Her offhanded grace is exceedingly catlike.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,40,"If ""Spider-Man 2"" is this summer's main comic-book-movie course, Catwoman is clearly the leftovers."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,40,"Catwoman, which talks about the ""duality"" inside all women (wild vs. docile, rapacious vs. cuddly), does have its guilty pleasures. Most of these come courtesy of ice queen Stone."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,38,"Hisses for Catwoman. Unfortunately for Oscar winner Halle Berry, this movie belongs in the litter box."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,38,A movie needs more than a few sexual innuendos and throaty purrs to keep us from taking a catnap. How about a strong story and credible characters?
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,38,"Catwoman is a mess, there's really no other way to describe it... It doesn't work as high art, and it's too ponderous to be truly high camp. As a fashion shoot for the pin-up crowd, however, it's the cat's meow."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,38,"Watching [Berry] run around in that getup I felt embarrassed, the way I do for people who put on makeup before climbing a StairMaster -- it's too much."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,38,"Like the action movies of yore (you know, the 1980s), Catwoman is simultaneously overstuffed and undernourished."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,30,"A howlingly silly, moderately diverting exercise in high, pointless style."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,30,"What the movie needs is a director, and what it gets instead is Pitof, a French visual-effects maestro so much fonder of technological wizardry than of human flesh that he manages to turn even his slinky, sinuous star attraction into a digitized synthespian frolicking about endless CGI cityscapes."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,30,It goes down (and comes back up) like a hairball.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,30,"Dragged down by a paper-thin story, the predictable number of fight scenes executed at equally predictable intervals and stock, unmemorable characters."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,30,Cinematographer Thierry Arbogast is the real superhero; his homage to noir thrillers compensates for the spotty CGI and rescues the movie from sex-kitten kitsch.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,30,"The ""Showgirls"" of superhero movies. This is not a compliment. A vacuous lingerie show posing as feminism, it's the biggest movie hairball this side of ""Garfield."""
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,A catastrophe.  This motion picture is an embarrassment to all involved.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,"Pitof can be blamed for the 89-cent digitized sets, the jerky or rubbery special effects, some clunky performances and more continuity errors than I could count."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,Cartoonish effects and overacting make this more corn than catnip.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,"Silly, tedious, inept disaster."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,"Berry is giving a performance much too earnest to have been intentionally campy, setting herself up as a veritable shoo-in for this year's ""Worst Actress"" Razzie. Me-ouch!"
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,Catwoman is pretty well summed up by Hedare: This is a disaster. Its a total bloody disaster.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,"The director, whose name is Pitof, was probably issued with two names at birth and would be wise to use the other one on his next project."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,"Not to be catty about it, but the stench of the litter pan is all over this big-screen $90 million disaster-in-waiting."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,"The film could have turned out worse, but only via the addition of a Tom Green cameo, or an accident in which the actors caught on fire."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,20,A cinematic cat-astrophe.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,16,"[Pitof's] managed to create an entire digitalized city that has all the allure of an underground parking garage. And his action, it's cluttered; his editing, it's confused. The result: blandness butchered, hamburger chopped, kitty littered."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,12,"Utterly devoid of merit, fantastic or otherwise, a more exasperating descent into the feline world is difficult to imagine."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,75,"My guess is that the average firefighter, like the average American moviegoer, might sort of enjoy the movie, which is a skillfully made example of your typical Schwarzenegger action film."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,75,Efficient action thriller.
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,70,A pretty decent action picture.
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,63,The best that can be said about Collateral Damage is that it offers a fleeting fantasy of American invincibility at a time when we desperately crave the reality. It functions as a movie narcotic.
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,63,"Morally simple, action packed and explosive."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,63,Schwarzenegger's mortality for the first time suits him.
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,63,Your heart will have you cheering Gordy on -- even as your brain complains that there are plot holes you could drive a truck bomb through.
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,60,"I liked, too, some late plot reversals, sorely needed after the numbingly simple straight-ahead plunge of the first hour of the movie. Things aren't quite what they seem and the twists are neatly done."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,60,"It's throwback, formula Ah-nuld all the way, a straightforward and simple revenge thriller."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,58,"It's about as convincing as any other Arnie musclefest, but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,50,"In a way, Collateral Damage is redeemed by its implausibility, because the closer it comes to reality, the more disturbing it gets. For once, viewers have reason to be grateful for having their intelligence insulted."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,50,"The result is an ''action film'' mired in stasis. The ending piles on the potboiler mayhem, but it's telling that Schwarzenegger's climactic catchphrase is down to one measly word. This time, he's the luggage."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,50,"Feels dated in the post-9/11 world. But it would have felt passé and unnecessary regardless; it's the sort of film Michael Dudikoff, Chuck Norris and their ilk cranked out on a near-monthly basis when Reagan was president."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,50,What we get is simply another opportunity for Schwarzenegger -- who seems to be in perpetual Terminator mode -- to flex his muscles.
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,50,"He's still big and burly, but, at age 54, Schwarzenegger is starting to look a little too old to be involved in this kind of stuff. Action films are the province of younger stars."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,50,"Schwarzenegger doesn't at all seem too old for the part; his bulging muscles still fill the action-hero's suit just fine. It's what he's doing that is tired and, maybe, played out."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,40,"The film's political philosophy, as much as it has one, is of the ""a plague on both your houses"" variety, painting the rebels and the CIA as equally fixated on killing innocent civilians for their own nefarious ideological ends. We've seen it all before, and we'll likely see it all again."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,40,"Utterly predictable, noisy and stupid."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,38,A mind-numbing carnival of violence.
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,38,"This is one of those would-be blockbusters that wants to have it both ways: It includes enough political commentary to have pretensions of seriousness, yet it's engineered to satisfy the explosion cravings of Schwarzenegger action fans, if any are left."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,30,A stinker.
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,30,"Head-scratchingly ordinary, given Schwarzenegger's need to prove he's still a virile (i.e., non-aging) action hero."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,30,"Intermittently, in attempts to articulate a coherent argument, Collateral Damage shifts from pulse-pounding mode to something more migraine-conducive."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,30,"It's another dumb vengeance picture -- ""In the Bedroom"" for meatheads."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,30,There's nothing special about this movie -- it's just business as usual for today's debased action-movie genre.
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,25,Collateral Damage isn't jingoistic; it also isn't exciting. It's a depressed rabble-rouser.
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,25,Quickly plunges into boggy terrain from which it can never extricate itself.
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,25,"Plays like a bad adolescent revenge fantasy on Ritalin, all jagged editorial edges and silly, pumped-up testosterone."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,20,"Manages to squeeze in several different endings  like a bad pop song that doesn't know when to fade out. But as Mr. Schwarzenegger's stature as an action figure diminishes, his effort to retain a piece of the market is touching."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,20,Ludicrous revenge thriller.
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,20,"More than an embarrassment, it's an insult."
Collateral Damage,5.5,40077257,20,Abort! Abort! It's that time of year when Hollywood releases movies it should never have made in the first place.
Gone in 60 Seconds,6.5,40000000,70,"The wealth of sketched-in technical detail is fairly engrossing, and the energy of this Halicki production (he also wrote, directed, stars and supplied the vehicles) is arresting. It's a pity that it had to descend into such routine carnage."
Gone in 60 Seconds,6.5,40000000,63,"Amateurish, badly acted and shot on the cheap (many sequences don't even have sync sound), this cult item features a 40-minute car chase (almost half the film's running time) that's nothing short of breathtaking, particularly in light of the obvious budgetary constraints."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,75,"Hitman stands right on the threshold between video games and art. On the wrong side of the threshold, but still, give it credit."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,70,"The best movie derived from a violent computer game we've ever seen. You can take or leave that kind of qualified high-five, but, for us, it was a thoroughly entertaining experience. Think of bargain basement ""James Bond"" amped up into TV den-sittin', mouse-clickin' overdrive. But with human actors."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,70,"In the finest tradition of adolescent identification figures, he's not only ruthless, dispatching numerous baddies with hair-trigger shots to the head, but profoundly desexualized, brushing off the insistent come-ons of a slinky prostitute (Olga Kurylenko) he's taken under his wing."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,50,"Ultimately Hitman is about bullets, blood, and bombs. For die-hard fans of the videogame, there is much to relish in terms of cobblestone car chases, punishing fistfights, cool weaponry, impossible physical feats, and ear-popping gun battles that rage through exclusive hotels in exotic locations."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,50,"As a movie on its own, it's simple monotony. Olyphant, affecting Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry voice, is about as menacing as Mr. Clean, and the action scenes - whether the weapons are fists, feet, swords or guns - fly past without any tension or suspense. Hitman is a miss."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,50,"This violent action is stylish but painfully formulaic, even by the undemanding standards of video-game narratives."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,50,"It's all meant, I suppose, to conjure up cold visions of Terminators and Robocops past, or, in this post-9/11 world, of bin Ladens and Bushes present. If so, conjure at will."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,50,"Not a spectacular movie, but the action scenes are well shot, there's no shortage of R-rated gore and the plot moves along quickly enough to mask the fact that the whole endeavor is completely ridiculous."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,50,"Here’s all you really need to know before the opening credits roll in Hitman: There’s going to be a lot of bloodshed. And that’s a good thing, considering there isn’t much dialogue to carry the film."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,50,"Essentially an episode of ""24."" Which may be a step up from a video game, but it's getting hard to tell."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,42,"The movie's one saving grace is Olyphant (""Live Free and Die Hard,"" HBO's ""Deadwood""), whose sociopathic elegance is gradually winning, and whose dry, monotonic, Eastwood-like delivery of one-liners is frequently, if perhaps unintentionally, very funny."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,38,"There have been plenty of movies adapted from video games before, but Hitman may be the first one that actually feels like a computer wrote and directed it."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,33,"By the time Olyphant leaves an enemy in the most ridiculous deathtrap since the '60s ""Batman,"" just because it looks kinda neat, the whole project has started to feel like ""Ultraviolet 2: The Further Stupidening."""
Hitman,6.3,39687694,30,"All the while, the music screams and clamors like an ignored child because director Xavier Gens and writer Skip Woods can't pump suspense into this inept mess."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,30,"Hitman exploits every action-flick cliché imaginable and still manages to be dull. It’s bang, boom, blah -- action movies for bored dummies."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,30,"While Gens can splatter gore with the best of them -- early in the film, a human body packed with C4 goes off in graphic detail -- he fails to stage so much as a single rousing action scene, even when he has four double-fisted swordsmen facing off inside an abandoned subway car. Game over. The audience loses."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,30,"Let's start with the obvious: Olyphant just isn't that intimidating an assassin. Think of some of cinema's more memorable button men: Léon, Luca Brasi, Frank Nitti...that's right, not a pretty boy in the bunch."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,25,Seeing Hitman isn't like playing a video game or even like watching someone else play a video game. It's like watching someone stupid play a bad video game.
Hitman,6.3,39687694,25,"Based on a videogame, Hitman could be the year's dumbest movie."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,20,"To be sure, Hitman is a lousy film, but like the video game that inspired it, it's also great fun, drawing as it does on everything from James Bondian Eurotrash panache to Vin Diesel's moribund XXX character."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,12,"If someone ran this guy through a scanner, the readout would say: “Mark down and stock in straight-to-video aisle."""
Hitman,6.3,39687694,10,"A Eurotrashy vidgame knockoff that misses its target by a mile. Numbingly unthrilling as it lurches from one violent encounter to another, the pic's dark roots in an electronic, non-dramatic medium are plain to see, and unsuspecting gamers lured to theaters will soon wish they were back home participating in the action themselves."
Out for Justice,6.1,39673161,75,"But it entertained me more than Seagal's first three movies. There's more verbal energy and atmosphere, more humor: in-your-face, scabrous, wise-guy macho humor."
Out for Justice,6.1,39673161,70,"Director John Flynn does a fair job of keeping the minimal storyline crawling along well enough to justify all the mayhem. Too bad the climactic confrontation doesn’t justify the build-up. Stuntwork, however, is first rate, and Seagal remains a convincing action figure."
Out for Justice,6.1,39673161,60,"OUT FOR JUSTICE's only real weakness is Seagal himself. Always an icon rather than an actor, Seagal's face appears puffy and he's developing jowls. This doesn't bode well for his future as an action hero, since looks count; ugly guys are relegated to the heavy roles, and it's hard to imagine Seagal settling for such an ignoble fate."
Out for Justice,6.1,39673161,50,"Though it boasts a big budget and is indeed busier and more densely populated than Seagal's previous efforts, Out for Justice feels cheap, not only in its production but in its content. It's ""Scarface"" without a point of view; it's shallow plot cluttered with extreme violence, both verbal and physical."
Out for Justice,6.1,39673161,50,I didn't care much for this movie. It's brutal and it's brutalizing. It seeks to make the audience an accomplice rather than a rational observer.
Out for Justice,6.1,39673161,40,"What’s numbing about this sub-Eastwood potboiler isn’t just the grisliness of the violence but the absence of any possibility that Seagal will stumble, or show doubt or pain, or have to challenge himself in order to defeat his enemies."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,80,"Decent vampire movies are few and far between, and I’m having a hard time remembering a recent one that impressed me like 30 Days of Night."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,80,This slick and sticky horror is the most accomplished treatment of vampire lore since Near Dark.
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,75,"It loses some of its bite by film's end, but 30 Days of Night manages to do for the vampire genre what ""28 Days Later"" did for the zombie flick: give age-old monsters a modern-day makeover."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,75,It's a bloodsucker's paradise.
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,75,"It's not perfect or ""Shining""-level inspired, but it's solid."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,75,A well-paced and entertaining horror debut.
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,75,"Works on its own terms, which is more than can be said of most horror films these days. If this is the kind of movie you're looking for, it delivers."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,70,"Directed by David Slade (""Hard Candy""), the action scenes are artful and terrifying; these killers move so quickly and decisively, there seems to be no hope for humanity."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,67,"These days, it's dark everywhere. Which makes Slade's wild, often exhilarating neo-Western ride into frostbit vampirism something of a respite, albeit one awash gore."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,67,"Which is more interesting: Vampires fighting over the potential long-term blowback of their Alaskan buffet, or a couple of exes bonding under duress? Seems like an easy decision, but 30 Days Of Night makes the wrong choice."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,63,"Mark Boone Jr. makes a vivid impression as eccentric loner Beau Brower, and Danny Huston is mesmerizing as the leader of the shrieking, slashing, wallowing-in-gore bloodsuckers. They effortlessly eclipse the rest of the cast."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,63,"Like most kiddies games, this one starts out fun and then gets tired. Inevitably, that's when Slade tries to revive our interest by upping the gore quotient."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,63,"It is well-made, well-photographed and plausibly acted, and is better than it needs to be."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,63,"A proficient, atmospheric fangfest that does nothing you haven't seen before but still does it passably well."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,63,"Based on a graphic novel, 30 Days of Night opens with a premise so promising it seems almost impossible to screw up."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,63,It's all pulled off with a firm sense of the fun in being scared.
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,60,Danny Huston is screamingly funny as the alternately finicky and savage Head Ghoul--he’s like something spewed forth from the bowels of the Politburo. The problem is structural.
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,58,"With such a good concept for a vampire movie, it's hard to believe it turned out to be this boring."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,58,"It's seductive in its buildup but overall as subtle and, alas, as humorless as a hatchet to the brain."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,50,Director David Slade's stab at the story is actually rather ordinary.
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,50,"Excels at bloodthirsty action, though dialogue and human-interest aspects are a tad anemic. Result is a mixed bag but has a catchy premise and quite enough splatter to satisfy gorehounds."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,50,"Nearly two hours long, 30 Days of Night makes you feel the cold (though it was shot in New Zealand) and feel the fangs, but it also makes you feel like 30 days is a pretty long time."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,50,"Forget about a stake through the heart: sheriff Josh Hartnett discovers that decapitation is the best way to stop the bloodsuckers, who suggest feral, steroid-crazed gymnasts as they scale buildings and leap onto moving vehicles."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,40,"Dramatically, the film is a shambles, with whiplash-inducing lurches in tone and pacing that make it seem as if portions were edited out of sequence."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,40,"The movie thus moves from truly creepy to truly inane, which is, unfortunately, all too common in films of this ilk."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,38,Lighter on horror than it is on inadvertent humor.
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,30,"The performers have little to do besides spill and drink blood in this tedious, inconsequential B picture. The sun doesn’t rise nearly fast enough."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,25,"You can expect a lot of shredding and gurgling. 30 Days of Night is relentless, but it's also relentlessly one-note."
30 Days of Night,6.6,39568996,25,"The movie approaches the final scene with a straight face, but it left the audience giggling spasmodically. This script probably should have gone all the way and thrown in a few quips: If your movie is a joke, at least be intentionally funny."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,88,"Body of Lies neither panders nor condescends. It involves current events and has a political viewpoint, but it overplays neither."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,88,"The crisply photographed and edited Body of Lies reveals some ambition, for while it certainly works as pure entertainment, this tale of a good man trying to extract himself from an impossible situation offers some commentary on America's feelings about being in Iraq."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,80,"Its generic attributes (and title) notwithstanding, Scott's film may be the sharpest of all the post-9/11 thrillers--and also the most purely entertaining--in the way it maps the vectors and currents of the modern intelligence-gathering game without losing us in its dense narrative thicket."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,75,"Body of Lies is a James Bond plot inserted into today's headlines. The film wants to be persuasive in its expertise about modern spycraft, terrorism, the CIA and Middle East politics. But its hero is a lone ranger who operates in three countries, single-handedly creates a fictitious terrorist organization, and survives explosions, gunfights, and brutal torture."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,75,"The result is commendably non-West-centric, but no less sentimentally conceived."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,75,Fascinating and flawed spy thriller.
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,75,"It's not like the screens are so flooded with decent movies that we couldn't use another, particularly a timely, clear-eyed thriller about the Middle East and the role of the U.S. therein."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,75,"As good as it is in pieces, its protagonists are distancing, its story is tangled, its film-noir cynicism is oppressive and unglamorous, and it just doesn't leave us with the satisfying unity of the kind of great movie it wants to be."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,75,Leonardo DiCaprio brings straight-razor reflexes and rooted emotion to the role of a deceptively rugged CIA man.
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,75,It's a genre film - the action is fierce and nonstop - with a brooding undercurrent of unease that aims for the complexities of John le Carre.
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,70,"It may not be as much fun as old spy movies starring Cary Grant or more recent entertainments such as ""Spy Game,"" directed by Ridley's brother Tony, but it feels all too accurate."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,70,"The movie is smart and tightly drawn; it has a throat-gripping urgency and some serious insights, and Scott has a greater command of space and a more explicit way with violence than most thriller directors."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,70,"With its urgent post-9/11 context and often brutal violence, it seems off-key to describe Body of Lies as a nifty political thriller, but that's what it is."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,70,"Always crisp and watchable. But as the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently hold our attention."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,67,"Ftrangely emotionless. There's little offered in the form of rooting interests or compassionate characterizations, making the film ultimately as ephemeral as its title."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,67,"Doesn't have much new to offer in either style or substance. It's got the same glossy-gritty urban warfare sheen as ""Black Hawk Down"" and every other Third-World geopolitical action thriller of the last few years."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,63,The most interesting thing about this slick but frustrating picture is the way it puts Crowe’s  Hoffman  at the center of our mixed feelings.
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,63,"A tautly paced, well-acted espionage thriller with the requisite explosions and action sequences. Still, it ends up leaving the viewer rather cold."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,63,"The romance seems tacked on as a way to humanize this character; there's no reason the nurse would take up with a brash, secretive American."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,63,"It's a generic, clunky title. The movie isn't quite as disposable, but it's not exactly memorable, either."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,63,"Scott doesn't bring much to the table as an action director, and his keen storytelling abilities go invisible here."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,60,"The film has one indelible asset: Mark Strong, who plays the Jordanian spymaster Hani. He's sleek and lounge-lizard sharp like a young Andy Garcia, and he could be bigger than Garcia. The Jordanian holds all the cards, and opposite two superstars, Strong is the only actor who holds the camera."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,A mostly formulaic approach that becomes more disappointing as the yarn unwinds.
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,"As it is, the movie is a hodgepodge of borrowings and half-cooked ideas, flung together into a feverishly edited jet-setting exercise in purposeless intensity."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,"For all of Ferris's desperate struggles, and for all the director's efforts to emulate the remarkable verisimilitude he achieved in ""Black Hawk Down,"" his new film remains abstract and unaffecting. It's a study in semisimilitude, more Google-Earthly than grounded in feelings."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,"Lacks, a story that makes it feel personal."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,"Like Scott's last picture, ""American Gangster,"" this is a little too slick and commanding for its own good; despite Crowe and DiCaprio's best efforts, their characters keep getting flattened by the steamroller narrative."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,"Aside from a nifty new way to avoid surveillance in the middle of the desert, there's nothing here we haven't seen in many other movies - including ""Spy Game,"" directed by Scott's brother Tony before 9/11."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,The sickly feeling that Body of Lies leaves at its conclusion isn't just about the brutality of its subject; it's the realization that real-life barbarism translates so easily into adrenaline kicks for the multiplex.
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,"DiCaprio and Crowe, two supposedly high-wattage movie stars, are remarkably dull to watch together--perhaps because so many of their scenes together take place over the phone."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,"In all, Body of Lies is a mixed bag of treats and trials, but it should be seen by audiences, and emulated and improved upon by other top directors."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,42,"It's a lot easier to follow than ""Syriana."" But intelligibility is about the only thing this international thriller has going for it."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,40,"Excessively intricate and extremely dull, the latest example of a filmmaker giving us a disjointed, overlong movie that’s unnecessarily confusing to follow."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,40,"It's like torture, though Body of Lies has nothing to spill."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,40,Depressingly inert.
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,40,"For all the enthralling visuals and action, the film feels garbled."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,33,"Most of this just seems, you know, so three years ago, so ""Bourne"" again."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,75,"This has to be an intentional wink from Stallone and his contemporaries. They know their days are not only numbered as action stars, but probably should have ended long ago."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,75,"So let me just say that this latest rah-rah red-meat installment is the biggest and best surprise of the series. It has its flaws, but it's mostly a big, dumb, gruntingly monosyllabic hoot."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,67,"There have been some reports that this is the last entry in the series, but it feels like the franchise is (finally) just getting started. ""The Expendables 4"" anyone?"
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,67,"It is forgettable fluff, but well-delivered, and it suggests that they'll be able to keep making these as long as they can prop up the cast, and with the younger generation making a decent showing this time out, they may even be able to hand it off when the time comes."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,63,"It’s a preposterously overstuffed strategy that, go figure, not only works, but even cures a thing or two that ailed the previous movies."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,60,"The Expendables 3 has its cake and shoots it: armed to the nipples with vast action and bulging A-listers, but over-over-blown and overcrowded. See it for Gibson’s big-bad."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,60,The Expendables 3 marks a sizeable improvement on the first two outings.
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,58,"With its third entry, the Sylvester Stallone-led Expendables franchise finally becomes the live-action Saturday morning cartoon it was always destined to be."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,50,"Joke’s way over, guys, and everyone’s now uncomfortable, thanks. Now, who needs a drink…?"
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,50,"For a mostly brainless movie, The Expendables 3 has a surprisingly dense plot, which is part of the problem. The 2-hour running length is unnecessarily long."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,50,"The best thing about this self-mocking affair, which runs a leisurely two-plus hours and affords plenty of time for an insane body count, is Antonio Banderas' manic gusto in the role of a gabby mercenary."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,50,"Antonio Banderas pretty much steals The Expendables 3. But at this stage in that winded franchise, that amounts to petty theft."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,50,"Hughes and cinematographer Peter Menzies Jr. handle the assignment skillfully enough, but without much imagination, sticking to a conventional action style that is more about the quantity of explosions than nuances of execution."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"Studying the topography of decay in a veteran actor’s face is one of the few worthy pursuits for moviegoers sitting through the epic-length, belligerently inconsequential The Expendables 3 — a picture whose very title proclaims its redundancy."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"Hughes' sequel fails because it makes no attempts whatsoever to rise above its predicable formula, even with the new cast additions and a promising director."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"It’s all a bit like a classic-rock tribute concert, or playing with all your action figures at once, or maybe “Cannonball Run,” with the strained buddy-buddy back-and-forth."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"Expendables 3 is a kind of ho-hum experience, wherein a lot of bullets are expended and a lot of structures exploded to minimal dramatic effect."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"The charm of these movies — such as it is — comes from the notion of aging action stars slugging it out between wheezes. So when Stallone brings in a new cast of mostly generic warriors, the premise, like the movie, deflates."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"The film actually has some solid elements—a couple of appealing supporting performances, a good villain, effective comic relief, and even some awkward but sincere attempts at subtext about its aging cast. But the fact remains: An Expendables movie should be fun, and for long stretches, this one isn’t."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"Thank the gods of war for Antonio Banderas, who single-handedly steals (and almost saves) the show as a loquacious assassin."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"The Expendables 3 is silly and overblown, yes, and it could definitely do without Antonio Banderas‘ motor-mouth routine (not to mention an out-of-nowhere reference to Benghazi), but it's less silly and overblown than “The Expendables 2,” for whatever that's worth."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,[A] blundering jackhammer of a film.
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"You can’t help but wonder if some important people in boardrooms watched the last two Expendables films and, between sips of mineral water, diligently noted all the ways in which the third might be made slicker and more polished, without realising the franchise’s doughy unslickness was the wellspring of its charm."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,37,The movie’s action sequences are both thrilling and idiotic.

The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,75,"You can't get this kind of full-on sensory-jolt anywhere else, not legally anyway. ""Sharkboy"" will be equally beloved in elementary schools and in college dorms."

The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,50,"Because the real world scenes are in 2-D and the dream and fantasy scenes are in 3-D, we get an idea of what the movie would have looked like without the unnecessary dimension. Signs flash on the screen to tell us when to put on and take off our polarizing glasses, and I felt regret every time I had to shut out those colorful images and return to the dim and dreary 3-D world.

The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,40,"Mr. Rodriguez seems unsure what his film is really about, making the moral of the story -- ""dream an unselfish dream"" -- feel more like a vaguely judgmental homily than a satisfying conclusion."

The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,30,"Based on characters created by Rodriguez's then-seven-year-old son, Racer Max, the film doesn't belong in wide release. It belongs on a refrigerator door, alongside ""100%"" spelling tests, old lunch menus, and notices from the PTA."

The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,30,"The concept is cute and the movie starts out well, but it devolves into a muddled, overstuffed mess that wears out its welcome around the time the novelty of 3-D effects wears off."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,25,"One could forgive a budget this threadbare, performances this amateurish, a plot this tortuous if the 3-D effects passed the cool test.

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,80,"The stylish and engrossing reinterpretation of the mythological king's early years lacks character development, but makes up for it with swashbuckling, sword-fighting, beast-slaying fun."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,75,"With Legend of the Sword, the filmmaker isn’t remaking or adapting anything. This is his version of Arthur’s origin story and, if nothing else, it’s kinetic and attention-grabbing."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,75,"In its finest moments, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is swift and clever and exhilarating. At its low points, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword plays like a cheesy B-movie, with ridiculous monsters and unintentionally laugh-inducing moments."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,70,"King Arthur wants desperately to please, and it mostly succeeds."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,67,"Ritchie’s ‘King Arthur’ is a pleasing big budget spectacle, oddly aligned to the filmmaker’s thematic interests and startlingly compatible with his signature razzle-dazzle style. In fact, the soggiest moments in the movie are the ones that adhere the closest to that ambitious multi-film strategy, lessening the fun, and emptying its impact."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,63,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a fun, if sacrilegious, first step in a franchise creation — one that observes the first commandment of storytelling: Thou shalt not be boring."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,60,"Put your fingers in your ears when the talking starts, and you might enjoy the view."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,60,"Ritchie’s film is at all times over the top, crashing around its digital landscapes in all manner of beserkness, sometimes whooshing along, sometimes stuck in the odd narrative doldrum. But it is often surprisingly entertaining, and whatever clunkers he has delivered in the past, Ritchie again shows that a film-maker of his craft and energy commands attention."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,58,"Sure, it doesn’t always work — mainly due to some bad writing, shoddy visual effects, and tonal oddities —  but when King Arthur: Legend of the Sword finds its stride, it’s a neat little tincture of Snatchian attitude and fantasy lore that is a good bit of early summer fun."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,58,"Ritchie is so adept that the film is compulsively watchable, but it’s watchable in the same way as a massive train wreck or the slow-motion demolition of a high-rise."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,58,"The franchise-hungry tentpole-itis of the present studio model has produced oh-so-many dumb rehashes of classic myths and fairy tales, but this is the first that is always funny on purpose."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,58,King Arthur could have been a rollicking blast. Instead it’s just another wannabe blockbuster with too much flash and not enough soul.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,55,"There are quick cuts and CG imagery and bro-ing out in nearly equal proportions; I found some of this excess to be heady and exciting, but by the end of the film’s running time, it all became a bit tiresome, to say nothing of tiring."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"Some might find it stimulating. Others will find it bonkers. Watching Jude Law do a slow-motion howl, for example, is certainly … something."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,King Arthur: Legend of the Sword isn't a movie as much as a feature length montage of bastardized lore and rejected Game of Thrones pitches.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"Arthur and Vortigern mix it up amid a lot of shenanigans, detours and filler, some bad, some good and all of it disposable."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"Unfortunately, “Arthur” is rarely at its best, bogged down in countless CGI sequences of battlefields or monsters."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"There are some fun bits in the film. Law is kind of funny, in and over-the-top, does-he-mean-to-be-like-this way. Hunnam is game for playing Arthur. But Ritchie, in his attempt to ensure there’s never a dull moment, makes it all exhausting."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"King Arthur is neither Guy Ritchie’s worst film nor his best, but it might well be his most frustrating. A compendium of all the things that make the British director so occasionally exciting and so often irritating, this new, hyper-stylized take on the Arthurian legends veers between genius and idiocy."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,Legend of the Sword’s overemphasis on the supernatural and the visually spectacular mortally wounds an often-rollicking adventure.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"In all honesty, the rat-a-tat repartee and tasty touches of Classic pre-Madonna Ritchie don’t excuse a bastardization that takes forever to get on its feet, that lacks the requisite love story (Ritchie and his “boys will be boys” pictures), that presents too much of Angle-land as a burnt-out pit quarry, that revels in anachronisms."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"Commercial considerations strangle the vitality from the movie, but Ritchie does his best to bring a bit of impish wit to the proceedings."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"From one moment to the next, it's possible to on some level enjoy the shaking up of tired conventions in a swordplay fantasy such as this and then to be dismayed by the lowbrow vulgarity of what's ended up onscreen. The film gives with one hand and takes away with the other, which can be frustrating in what's meant to be an entertainment."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,A bloated action movie with occasional breaks in the monotony. It’s Perfectly Fine™; entirely competent but unexceptional in just about every way.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,45,"The most frustrating thing about Ritchie's take on King Arthur is that it has all the necessary elements to be a great version of the story, but rather than giving them to the audience as such, they are put into a blender and thoroughly mixed."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,42,"Part “Game of Thrones,” part “Snatch,” and almost all bad, Guy Ritchie’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is one of those generic blockbusters that has nothing to say and no idea how to say it."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"Somehow hectic and lumbering, diverting and dispiriting all at once, this mud-toned medieval pulp largely cleaves to the spirit of Ritchie’s “Sherlock Holmes” series, reducing a fabled figure of British lore to two hours of tough-guy swagger and head-pounding digital thwackery."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"It's all more wearying than fun. Except for Law, whose courtly sangfroid can elevate even the dumbest roles."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,The story never drags – it’s too frenetically paced for that – but it’s still kind of a drag.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"Although it flickers to life at times, King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword devolves into a jumbled affair, weighed down by confusing supernatural elements and a lazy reliance on visual effects."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"This is a tonal misfire, its characters cut down by a blitzkrieg of whip pans, CGI and thunderous percussion. And with Ritchie again rummaging in his increasingly threadbare bag of tricks, the result is a movie more jaundiced than jaunty."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"Ultimately, “King Arthur” is just a loud, obnoxious parade of flashy set pieces, as one visually busy, belligerent action scene after another marches by, each making less sense than the last, but all intended to overwhelm."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"Excitement is fleeting, dialogue rambles and Jude Law’s tyrant-approved throne slouch pretty much sums the film’s overall attitude – a hearty “meh,” worthy of no diamond-studded crown."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"Ritchie’s film...is so misshapen and inert, your imagination and memory never come close to being sparked by it. Just sticking with the plot soaks up every ounce of concentration you have."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,38,The result is an oxymoron: a frenetic slog. That’s unfortunately what happens to King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,38,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword” lumbers on for more than two hours, weighed down with oversized elephants, excessively populated action sequences, and weirdly sudden occurrence of slow motion, as if the film is yawning."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,38,"Optimism is nowhere to be found in Ritchie's movie itself. It is a grim and stupid thing, from one of the world's most successful mediocre filmmakers, and if Shakespeare's King Lear were blogging today, he'd supply the blurb quote: ""Nothing will come of nothing."""
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,37,"King Arthur has a vulnerable heart beating somewhere under all the grimy, sweaty muscles lovingly displayed for the camera. It’s just buried too often under narrative chaos, and the inexplicable ideal that if a story runs at double speed and triple energy, the gaping holes in the story will outpace anyone’s notice."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,33,What we really get is a film made of utter nonsense that’s even less interested in its characters than it is in telling a story.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,30,This latest retelling of the ancient Arthurian myth is a stinker for the ages.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,30,"King Arthur is guilty of many blockbuster sins critics have taken it upon themselves to call out over the last decade. And yet, seeing a version of them this derivative and dumb, with neither CGI grandeur nor a sense of fun on its side, is like a splash of cold water in the face, a reminder of how bad things can be when nobody cares."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,25,"Ritchie aspires to be a great British director, but his working his way through British icons — Sherlock Holmes wasn’t even safe — does no one any good. He just reduces them to his own vernacular, his own level, and he ends up revealing nothing about them and everything about his own narrow vision."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,25,"An epic bore that believes if you make a movie long and loud and repetitive enough, audiences will conclude it's saying something profound. Wrong."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,25,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is stupid enough to send you back to the one movie that did the saga right by ripping it to shreds, 1975’s “Monty Python and the Holy Grail.”"
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,25,"For all the attempts to update King Arthur to be cool and sexy, neither the character nor the film around him musters any spark."
The Sword and the Sorcerer,5.6,39103425,63,"Hearts are ripped out, heads are smashed, and there's plenty of flesh to be seen. If that's what you crave for a night of retro viewing, this is your flick."
The Sword and the Sorcerer,5.6,39103425,60,Editor Marshall Harvey stitches the messy pieces together with considerable panache.
The Sword and the Sorcerer,5.6,39103425,60,"A nonsensical, Hollywood-made, R-rated adventure-fantasy set in a primeval past about usurped kingdoms, erring knights, recently awakened ogres, distressed princesses and various hangers-on."
The Sword and the Sorcerer,5.6,39103425,50,"Combine beaucoup gore and an atrocity-a-minute action edited in fastpace style. Then, toss in a scantily clad cast of none-too- talented performers mouthing dimwitted dialog and garnish with a touch of medieval gibberish. The result would be something resembling The Sword and the Sorcerer."
The Sword and the Sorcerer,5.6,39103425,50,"Lots of gore and some decent artistic effects may keep audiences interested; if not, then the scantily clad."
The Sword and the Sorcerer,5.6,39103425,50,"The Sword and the Sorcerer is so dominated by its special effects, its settings and locations, that it doesn't care much about character. It trots its people onscreen, gives them names and labels, and puts them through their paces. That's not enough."
The Longest Day,7.8,39100000,100,The Longest Day is visually stunning--its extraordinary camera movement and Cinemascope photography brilliantly augmenting the meticulously reenacted battle scenes. The only thing bigger than the film's scope are its stars.
The Longest Day,7.8,39100000,90,"It is hard to think of a picture, aimed and constructed as this one was, doing any more or any better or leaving one feeling any more exposed to the horror of war than this one does."
The Longest Day,7.8,39100000,80,A solid and stunning war epic.
The Longest Day,7.8,39100000,78,Just look at the cast and try to resist the testosterone pull of this movie.
The Longest Day,7.8,39100000,60,"High on noise, spectacle and heroism as the Allies invade Normandy, generally strong on performances and humour, but still over-long and laden with the usual national stereotypes."
The Longest Day,7.8,39100000,60,"At three hours it does seem bloody long at times, but is still a suitably epic tribute."
The Longest Day,7.8,39100000,60,"Seen now, the picture is ludicrous, pointless, and stirring all at once."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,60,"Morita still charms, Macchio still tightropes between petulence and raw optimism, whilst the fight scenes are competent enough to offset the woeful romantic sub-plotting."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,50,"With its sluggish script and unaging characters, The Karate Kid Part III has the rote sense of film makers trying to crank out another moneymaker."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,50,Perhaps the series is simply getting cynical and tired.
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,50,"After suffering endless abuse, Daniel wins with just a few well placed whacks: those expecting standard wish-fulfilment fantasy will be disappointed that (in tune with the philosophy, of course) he didn't give the punk a pasting."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,50,"Unfortunately, the pattern has so calcified that Gene Autry westerns seem like models of moral complexity by comparison."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,40,"This material is wearing out its welcome. I have mastered all of the lessons The Karate Kid movies have to teach and all of the surprises they have to spring. I am also intimately familiar with the plot formula, so that nothing in this third film comes as the faintest surprise. Perhaps it is time, as Mr. Miyagi might say, to study something else."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,38,"Although III claims seven times as much action as ever before, the movie is still so boring that even the love interest (Robyn Lively) leaves early. She's no Kung Fool."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,38,"In short, writer Robert Mark Kamen gave director Avildsen and his cast too little to work with for The Karate Kid Part III to have gone into production in the first place."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,37,"The makers of The Karate Kid Part III - also responsible for its successful predecessors - have either delivered or taken a few too many kicks to the head along the way, resulting in a particularly dimwitted film that will likely spell the death of the series."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,30,"More a sequel to the original than an extension of the action in Part II, The Karate Kid Part III is half-hearted and very dull."
On Deadly Ground,4.5,38590500,75,"The fuzzy thinking allows for gorgeous outdoor photography and a few too many dead spots, but Seagal the director shows real muscle by staging one of the screen's best-ever exploding helicopters and allowing Seagal the star to spit out tough talk, as when he refuses to shoot Caine because, ""I don't want to dirty my bullets."""
On Deadly Ground,4.5,38590500,60,"Although you could certainly wish that Seagal and his writers, Ed Horowitz and Robin U. Russin, could have found less preachy ways to express themselves, On Deadly Ground is otherwise lively entertainment for action fans."
On Deadly Ground,4.5,38590500,60,"It isn't difficult to identify those who will and won't like this film. There's plenty of violence, lots of fights and explosions, and the miniatures special effects work is impressive. A sizable portion of the Seagal crowd will likely be annoyed by the environmental message and the Eskimo religious practices because they interfere with On Deadly Ground's pacing. In the end, however, there's probably enough bang to overcome these flaws for Seagal's fans, if not anyone else."
On Deadly Ground,4.5,38590500,50,"This is a vanity production parading as a social statement. It nonetheless has enough sound, fury and flash to satisfy the action crowd who have propped up Seagal’s career."
On Deadly Ground,4.5,38590500,50,"Loud, stupid and clumsy."
On Deadly Ground,4.5,38590500,40,"Mr. Seagal's own film is awesomely incoherent, a mixture of poorly executed violence and Dances With Wolves-style astral musings."
On Deadly Ground,4.5,38590500,40,"In contrast to his short, sharp fighting style, Seagal's presentation of the human conflicts and underlying issues consists of vague, sweeping gestures."
On Deadly Ground,4.5,38590500,40,"This fuzzily illustrated sermon is mostly an attempt to prove that the internal combustion engine is obsolete, and that oil companies everywhere are conspiring to wipe out alternative methods."
On Deadly Ground,4.5,38590500,38,"Martial arts maven Seagal has long been on deadly ground with critics, and this, his directorial debut, is likely to keep him there."
On Deadly Ground,4.5,38590500,38,"Certain things must be answered, like Seagal's environmental lip service that is utterly mocked by the movie's need to blow things up and destroy property."
On Deadly Ground,4.5,38590500,38,"What is there to do but laugh in self-defense at such pompous self-regard when blood gushes, fuses pop, and Seagal scowls in a series of snappy, embroidered buckskin jackets?"
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,80,What follows is pulp made near-profound through director Jonathan Mostow’s sure-handed guidance.
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,75,"There's fun robot stuff, some good philosophical ideas, and a brief, nutty Willis-Ving Rhames reunion 15 years after ""Pulp Fiction."""
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,75,"Among cheesy sci-fi movies meant to make you think, I'll take Surrogates over ""District 9."" Both are highly derivative, but in the course of recombining the basic chromosomes of ""Blade Runner,"" ""The Matrix"" and especially ""I, Robot,"" Surrogates nudges the robo-thriller in an interesting direction."
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,75,"This represesents the smartest high-budget, high-profile science fiction film to have come along in quite some time."

Surrogates,6.3,38577772,70,"Surrogates stays afloat by not taking itself too seriously, but also by recognizing that a movie about robots shouldn't look as if it were made by one."
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,63,"Surrogates is entertaining and ingenious, but it settles too soon for formula."
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,60,"Willis is fine, both as his blond action figure (Zack Morris hair) and actual self, in trusty bruised palooka mode. Mostow does good meat-and-potatoes genre work, coherent even when reckless."
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,50,"The questions the movie raises have less to do with science than movie execution: Do the actors sound so robotic because they are playing robots well or humans badly? And did a machine write this dialogue? If so, could we please apply for an upgrade?"
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,50,Half a howler but not nearly funny enough.
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,50,"A reasonably watchable sci-fi B movie, a case of a good director and some intriguing ideas struggling to overcome formula plotting, limp dialogue, and a serious case of the sillies."
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,42,"Relentlessly plods from one dour moment to the next, coming to life only in a late-film car chase that takes the possibilities of a world filled with robots to an absurd extreme."
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,40,"A mechanical sci-fi'er absent of logic or emotions. It functions as an expensive place-filler on the Disney release schedule and, as such, will be welcomed by only the least discriminating thriller fans."
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,40,"An interesting idea, but unfortunately, the film's narrative and emotional engine operate as mechanically as the titular, dead-eyed glamazoids."
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,40,"In this kind of industrial entertainment, particularly one that seems to be missing some connective narrative tissue, it’s hard to know if the writers or the director can be credited or blamed for what’s left on screen."
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,40,"An ambitious but sub-ordinary SF epic in which, as so often, Willis is better than his material."
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,38,"Surrogates, which borrows tone and content freely from ""I, Robot,"" is all windup and no pitch."
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,30,"Surrogates takes an interesting idea -- the triumph of technological convenience over grimy, workaday life -- and buries it under clumsy exposition, unconvincing action sequences and a by-the-numbers conspiracy plot."
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,30,"The premise for this sci-fi actioner makes sense for about four seconds, after which you begin to wonder why everyone on the planet would willingly become a shut-in."
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,20,"The filmmakers were too busy throwing together potential blockbuster material to notice all the loose ends and gaping holes in logic. Which may, ultimately, explain why Willis looks so confused throughout. Maybe he, too, is straining to locate some intelligence amid all the machinery."
Surrogates,6.3,38577772,0,"Surrogates' morality is less Asimov than asinine, although it's bizarrely reassuring, in a nihilistic sort of way, to believe that in the future, when the world is ready to play The Sims for real (so to speak), our avatars are all going to look like generic porn stars with shitty airbrush jobs."
Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,38538188,67,"Far more coherent than its immediate predecessor, Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D benefits greatly from its two likable young leads and some of the series' wittiest, pun-filled writing."
Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,38538188,63,"Even the use of the 3D format -- and the 4D ""Aroma-Scope,"" which allows the viewer to enjoy various odors in sync with the film -- adds to its good-natured earnestness."
Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,38538188,60,"Far more charming, quick-witted and high spirited than anyone could have expected...for a film that didn't screen for press. It's gimmicky up the wazoo (not just 3D, but scratch-and-sniff ""Aroma-Scope"" cards handed out at screenings) and it's all the better for it."
Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,38538188,50,"The visual effects are as gleefully shoddy as ever, and the playful ideas sometimes achieve a dreamlike suggestiveness."
Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,38538188,50,"The film is being released in both 2- and 3-D, and from what I could tell the 3-D version is still almost 50-50. What use is made of the technology is hardly worth the effort, unless you've always wanted to experience a cascade of cheesies in 3-D."
Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,38538188,42,"The fourth installment of Robert Rodriguez's franchise that keeps adding dimensions even as it loses charm would have been better titled ""Spy Kids: All the Time Puns in the World."""
Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,38538188,40,"This fourth ""Spy Kids"" picture isn't so much bad as it is just boring, lacking the buzz and brio of even some of the earlier entries in the series. It feels like someone is now just marking time."
Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,38538188,38,"Alba, meanwhile, is again ridiculously shoehorned into a comedy gig, although she does have an amusing opening bit spying while nine months pregnant. If only diaper bomb gags weren't the inevitable follow-up."
Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,38538188,38,Nobody has much that's funny to say or cool to do. Even the spy gadgets are lame.
Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,38538188,33,"The Spy Kids series once seemed charmingly homemade. These days, it feels less charmingly homemade than maddeningly amateurish."
Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,38538188,30,"The fall-off in sexiness, soulfulness and wittiness from Ms. Gugino and Antonio Banderas, the parents in the first three ""Spy Kids"" films, to Ms. Alba and Joel McHale is whiplash steep."
Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,38538188,30,"A cheap-looking, vaguely depressing echo of Robert Rodriguez's well-loved kidpic trilogy, assembled with minimal imagination or effort."
Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,38538188,30,"Arriving eight years after the lame third installment in Dimension's profitable series, this seems like far too little way too late."
Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World,3.5,38538188,20,"Even by the broad standards of children's flicks, the film's prank-prone next-gen tween spy Rebecca (Blanchard) is one monstrous brat."
Running Scared,6.5,38500726,80,"Nonstop banter between the two stars is rowdy, intimate, natural and often very funny. Hyams keeps most of it fresh, including the action ending, staged within one of Chicago’s architectural spectacles, the cavernous, glass-enclosed Illinois State Building."
Running Scared,6.5,38500726,75,"I liked the smaller-scale scenes the best, the ones where Hines and Crystal were doing their stuff."
Running Scared,6.5,38500726,70,"With their sloppy slapstick and wet Menudo jokes, one only wonders why more people aren't out to kill them. But Crystal and Hines do flavour the film with genuine warmth, and despite some cheap gags, work well together to produce some truly funny moments."
Running Scared,6.5,38500726,63,"Crystal and Hines are immediately likable on the screen, so the fact that Running Scared isn`t all that we expect must be due to the script. The film`s ending does leave room for a sequel. If one is made, director Hyams should get Crystal and Hines a better story as well as that bar in Florida."
Running Scared,6.5,38500726,63,"Running Scared's razor-crisp editing (by James Mitchell) shows that you can combine mayhem and laughs. But the action becomes huge, cartoony, out of scale, crushing the warmth Crystal and Hines have built up. And the movie is too long by about 15 minutes, a deadly thought for a comedy."
Running Scared,6.5,38500726,60,Hines and Crystal succeed in creating a new buddy team that ranks with the likes of Robert Redford and Paul Newman.
Running Scared,6.5,38500726,50,There is something disturbing in the way the film elevates cynicism and detachment into heroic attitudes.
Running Scared,6.5,38500726,50,"Decent premises and the promise of Billy Crystal pale in a film that fronts up to, then whimpers away from, the prospect of leaping out of its genre's boundaries."
Running Scared,6.5,38500726,50,"Still another, thoroughly depressing demonstration of the extent to which television now dictates the style and the manners of so many of the movies we see in theaters."
Midnight Run,7.6,38413606,100,"One of the most entertaining, best executed, original road pictures ever."
Midnight Run,7.6,38413606,100,"Whoever cast De Niro and Grodin must have had a sixth sense for the chemistry they would have; they work together so smoothly, and with such an evident sense of fun, that even their silences are intriguing."
Midnight Run,7.6,38413606,90,The virtue of Midnight Run is not that it does anything new; the virtue is that it does everything old so well.
Midnight Run,7.6,38413606,88,"The funniest buddy movie ever and a generally daffy one at that. It features some of the most genuinely stupid and amusing tough guys in the history of cinema, and a tantalizing slow burn by Deniro."
Midnight Run,7.6,38413606,88,"Robert De Niro is one extended pleasure in Midnight Run -- a real actor putting his considerable talent to work in a well-scripted comedy. And he's more than complemented by Charles Grodin, a brilliant comic performer who has been wasted up to now in small roles or lousy movies.  [22 July 1988]"
Midnight Run,7.6,38413606,88,"Miraculously, De Niro and Grodin turn this sow's ear into a plausible vehicle for a buddy movie, and thanks to both of them, this movie springs to life."
Midnight Run,7.6,38413606,88,"Director Martin Brest has allowed the actors to improvise, and their resulting interaction is more realistic, funny, and surprising than that of any buddy film released in the last several years."
Midnight Run,7.6,38413606,80,"Too routinely formulaic to be anything more than modestly diverting. But as modest diversions go it cruises along at a reasonably brisk pace and, in the smaller details -- the off-in-the-margins doodling -- it has its rewards. [20 July 1988]"
The Terminator,8,38400000,100,Director James Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd (both of whom co-wrote the script) demonstrate their storytelling virtuosity.
The Terminator,8,38400000,100,"A blazing, cinematic comic book, full of virtuoso moviemaking, terrific momentum, solid performances and a compelling story."
The Terminator,8,38400000,100,"Getting the extraordinary physical specimen of Arnold Schwarzenegger for the lead was a stroke of genius and a stroke of fortune. Each of his pecs is the size of a bull’s flank. It is a tremendous black-comic performance and, without Schwarzenegger, the movie is of course unthinkable."
The Terminator,8,38400000,100,"From the slam-bang direction to the relentless pace to the not-a-word-wasted dialogue and even the driving synth score, everything else about The Terminator just works."
The Terminator,8,38400000,100,The havoc makes for a genuine steel metal trap of a movie that may very well be the best picture of its kind since The Road Warrior.
The Terminator,8,38400000,91,It's a rousing science fiction story that proves an on-screen adrenaline rush.
The Terminator,8,38400000,90,An amazingly effective picture that becomes doubly impressive when one considers its small budget.
The Terminator,8,38400000,90,"When Terminator is not taking itself seriously -- and sometimes even when it is -- it's lots of fun. And filmmakers James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd don't drown us in blood, though it's not for the squeamish."
The Terminator,8,38400000,90,"An efficient, cold-blooded sci-fi splatter movie that never makes the mistake of forgetting that on some level it is deeply ridiculous."
The Terminator,8,38400000,90,"Those nightmares we’ve all had about being chased by some relentless, unstoppable monster? This is the movie adaptation."
The Terminator,8,38400000,88,"It's rather confusing. But in the context of this wildly imaginative movie, it's all, rather exciting, too."
The Terminator,8,38400000,88,"Schwarzenegger is presented as a lumbering slab of dumb, destructive strength--the image is more geological than human--and Cameron plays his crushing weightiness against the strangely light, almost graceful violence of the gunplay directed against him. The results have the air of a demented ballet."
The Terminator,8,38400000,80,A B-movie with flair.
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,88,"What if Reagan’s America got a taste of her own interventionist foreign policies? Apocalypse, wow."
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,75,"The film has some truly great right-wing anarchic moments, bur for the most part its politics are all too predictably – and only – militaristic, misogynist, racist, and xenophobic; for too much of its running time, it’s just a childishly simplistic masturbatory fantasy for right-wing hebephrenics that’s mostly safe enough to play the White House."
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,75,"It packs plenty of rabble-rousing ammunition, but its sloppy execution is unlikely to win any merit badges for marksmanship."
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,67,"As an action movie, Red Dawn is a repetitive headache, and anyone with Blue State sympathies will be appalled at its manipulations and exaggerations. But there's smart subtext beneath the big dumb explosions."
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,60,Red Dawn is at once a mainstream shoot ‘em up action picture and an ideologically demented exercise in American paranoia.
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,60,"Director John Milius, the barbarian behind Conan, co-wrote this anti-gun-control, anti- Communist, survivalist script with Kevin Reynolds. Sick and silly as it is, the idea could have been intriguing, had it gone anywhere, which it didn't."
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,60,"Another infantile right-wing fantasy from writer-director John Milius, this cinematic embodiment of the paranoid delusions of militarists, survivalists, and television evangelists is definitely a film for the Reagan era. Red Dawn is simply too
simplistic and inept to be taken seriously."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,75,"A multi-colored downer fantasy which combines bursts of imagination with a bleak worldview, resulting in something that rarely feels mainstream."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,60,"Perhaps a folly and – Kikuchi aside - too deadpan to be a romp, this is still a decent, colourful samurai spectacle with a classical look (lots of symmetrical compositions) and a story which stands up under multiple retellings."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,50,"This one never quite decides if it wants to be a big, boisterous epic or a solemn retelling, and it nearly disappears into the crack between the two."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,50,An odd mix of stiff and sumptuous.
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,50,"There’s little sense of urgency, or — oddly, given the film’s title — of scale. You never really think that the 47 are truly outnumbered, and the large action scenes are often just incomprehensible."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,50,"While the visuals are lovely to behold, this unremarkable version of the classic 18th century Japanese legend is stiff and uninvolving."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,40,"Hollywood's latest play for the growing Asian market revisits the ancient Japanese legend of self-sacrifice, hoping to offset its garbled narrative and grinding humourlessness with 3D and Keanu Reeves as a samurai Jesus."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,40,"47 Ronin can’t entirely paper over the void at its center, traceable partly to the shadowboxing of computer-aided filmmaking or studio tinkering."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,40,"As impressive as these visual elements prove to be, the film struggles to grab and maintain audiences’ interest, whether or not they know the underlying legend by heart."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,37,"Ultimately, the movie just doesn’t justify its outrageous bid to turn a solemn tale of self-sacrifice into swaggering global-marketplace entertainment."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,30,"Rinsch, making his feature debut, shows the shortcoming of someone coming from the image-based world of commercials and advertising. There are moments of genuine beauty and a few terrifically eye-popping effects, but no feel yet for storytelling."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,30,"It falls short on character definition, emotional involvement, narrative drive and originality."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,25,It’s a movie of pointless scenes.
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,25,"In spite of its enjoyable, easy-to-exploit aspects, 47 Ronin is a big budget spectacle hamstrung by its need to be at once flippant and respectful of its honor-driven source material."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,25,This botched vision accepts the warrior's nobility at face value and sees the story merely as a springboard for high-flying action and CGI special effects.
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,20,"This Hungarian-shot bore is so indistinct it reeks of no place more than Hollywood, where the fascinating specifics of history and legend are ground into universal mush."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,20,"47 Ronin is elephantine and lumbering, a wobbly, would-be epic that aspires to the scope and majesty of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, but comes up woefully short."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,20,"The basics of the story remain unchanged, but it’s the wanna-be-blockbuster additions that rankle, be it the incoherent direction of first-time feature director Carl Rinsch or the copious CGI beasties who look like rejected ""Lord of the Rings"" villains."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,20,"“I will search for you through 1,000 worlds and 10,000 lifetimes!” Reeves promises his beloved. Anyone who sits all the way through this glossy folly will know exactly how that feels."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,5,"Insufferably boring, culturally hegemonic, and profoundly ugly."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,0,"In the monumentally dull 47 Ronin, Reeves mumbles monosyllabic claptrap between dull action scenes. And it’s a shame: At almost 50 years old, the actor allows this turgid, clanky flick to play to his worst stereotypes."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,70,"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is an utterly depersonalized thrill machine, yet it’s exactly the film’s go-go relentlessness that is likely to make boys and girls eat it up."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,67,"This big-screen incarnation of the TV kids' adventure show that spawned a marketing empire is no better than it should be, but it's lively enough to fulfill its primary mission -- which is, of course, to sell more toys."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,67,The production values are much higher than those of the TV shows. There's even a plot.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,63,Power Rangers is good junk.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,60,"The special effects are surprisingly good. And the too-numerous fight scenes have a certain flavor, since Ivan's henchmen always explode in ooze when they are destroyed, which brings out the eeewww in the audience."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,60,"Beyond its baby-sitting capabilities, Power Rangers doesn't morph into anything special. It hasn't a single fresh idea."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,60,"It's easy to see why the Rangers are popular. Even before they magically morph, the kids are sky-diving, roller-blading and living without parental authority. And they kick serious butt. But it's all done quite unhumorously."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,50,"With absolutely as little time devoted to character or plot development as possible, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie may not be Battleship Potemkin, but it does deliver the cheesy sci-fi goods for fans of the colorful television show, even if it's not likely to win any new converts."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,50,"On such a limited level this delivers; if you take the kids, leave them to it."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,50,"The comic-book fight sequences, too, are a little more imaginative. But, like the series, the film is also corny as hell, with glaring continuity lapses, cringeworthy performances, silly monsters and laughable set-pieces."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,50,"Noisy and meant for children only. A bored grown-up's only consolation is that the Rangers' popularity has probably peaked, and the next kiddie phenomenon must be on the way."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,50,"Lively, colorful, violent, stupid."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,50,"There's an appeal here, for sure, but if you're not 8 years old you may never figure it out."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,40,This movie is bad on a galactic scale.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,40,Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie is about as close as you can get to absolute nothing and still have a product to project on the screen.
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,80,"Never managing to look more hi-tech or further on from 1987 than, well, Hi-tech trainers, this Arnie vehicle still runs it's bloody course without dropping many gears. A brainless, breathless thrill."
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,70,"Has the manners and the gadgetry of a sci-fi adventure film but is, at heart, an engagingly mean, cruel, nasty, funny send-up of television. It's not quite Network, but then it also doesn't take itself too seriously."
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,63,"The one element in the movie that is not standard and that does have some energy is the TV show itself, with Dawson's performance as the egotistical, sleaze-bag host."
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,60,"For the right audience, it'll be fun. It's for action movie fans with a taste for something off the beaten track -- but not too far. And for people who like to rail and spew against the vulgarity and stupidity of TV -- but keep watching it all anyway."
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,50,"Once things get going, The Running Man just turns into a silly chase movie populated by baddies who look like B-level pro-wrestling villains."
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,50,"With a wholly derivative concept, confused scripting, and incredibly sloppy direction, THE RUNNING MAN is a frustrating experience."
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,40,"Format works only on a pure action level, with some exciting, but overly repetitious, roller-coaster style sequences of runners hurtling into the game through tunnels on futuristic sleds. Schwarzenegger sadistically dispatches the baddies, enunciating typical wisecrack remarks (many repeated from his previous films), but it’s all too easy, despite the casting of such powerful presences as Jim Brown and former wrestlers Jesse Ventura and Prof. Toru Tanaka."
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,40,The film doesn't look good; it's as if the flat lighting and boring set of the TV show had infected everything else. And Big Arnie's quilted outfit makes him look like a duvet.
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,40,"You want to know if The Running Man is a good-time macho show, right? Stay at home and watch professional wrestling. Or Miami Vice (same director -- Paul Michael Glaser). Sure there's blood spattering and bullets riddling and Big Boys Banging Biceps. But through the dry-ice haze, Running Man is surprisingly boring."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,80,"From frame one Showtime displays an ingenuity, cleverness and briskness that never flags."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,75,It's getting hard not to think of De Niro as anything but a dead-pan comedian.
Showtime,5.5,38082712,70,It's hard not to warm to a film that features William Shatner (playing himself) looking at De Niro's character and complaining about what a lousy actor he is.
Showtime,5.5,38082712,70,Would seem to be surefire casting. The catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders.
Showtime,5.5,38082712,63,Chalk up another big-name star vehicle that fails to live up to a wealth of potential.
Showtime,5.5,38082712,63,Its breeziness keeps it from ever being completely bland or flat.
Showtime,5.5,38082712,60,"It's a wretchedly dumb, lazy and incoherent movie that's magically rendered watchable by Eddie Murphy's charm and Robert De Niro's presence."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,50,"De Niro's scowl and Murphy's sass are inherently funny, though in this case both actors are forced to call in moviegoers' long-established goodwill."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,50,"The moment Showtime begins to take itself even remotely seriously, it loses whatever edge it might have had -- and that occurs less than 15 minutes into the proceedings. The best time for Showtime is no time."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,50,"So pleased with its own spoofy conceit it stays in annoyingly self-amused, predictable mode."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,50,"By refusing to take anything seriously (including himself), Shatner lifts the movie to a truly funny level of absurdity. Soon, though, it goes back to being the type of buddy picture Hollywood stamps out like stale cookies."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,50,The movie's funny in the opening scenes and then forgets why it came to play.
Showtime,5.5,38082712,50,"Showtime is better than the fourth ""Lethal Weapon,"" which was pretty bad, but not as good as the original ""Lethal Weapon"" or the superior ""48HRS."""
Showtime,5.5,38082712,50,"No matter how much good will the actors generate, Showtime eventually folds under its own thinness."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,50,A flat-out cynical attempt to launch a new Lethal Weapon-like franchise.
Showtime,5.5,38082712,40,"De Niro and Murphy are visibly uncomfortable with each other. Their improvisation seems chaotic and mismanaged, and the movie follows in kind."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,38,"Isn't particularly assaultive, but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase, explosion or gunfight again."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,38,"This one makes De Niro's recent film ""15 Minutes"" look like ""Network.""  Even worse, aside from a few scenes with Shatner, it just isn't funny."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,30,"A shrill, strained and shallow riff on a tired idea."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,30,"Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro have made any number of lame movies on their own, but there's a special wastefulness connected to their first co-starring vehicle, Showtime: It's lameness times two, and then some."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,30,"Plays every convention twice, once as parody and once by the book, but the movie, trying to be two things at once, fails at both."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,30,"A disgrace to the talents of Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy, but it's not enough just to say that. It's also a disgrace to the talents of Rene Russo and whoever drove the coffee truck to the set every day."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,30,De Niro seems to be reacting to nothing so much as the lame movie he's stuck in.
Showtime,5.5,38082712,30,A criminal waste of talent.
Showtime,5.5,38082712,25,Muddled screenwriting and uninspired directing.
Showtime,5.5,38082712,25,"It is, from beginning to end, a paint-by-numbers movie. There's a mildly entertaining climax, but most of Showtime is a layering of tired pop-culture tropes by actors who are not especially interested in what they're doing."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,25,There's so little urgency to the plot that one eventually feels not even the actors and filmmakers believe for a second in what's going on.
Showtime,5.5,38082712,25,Add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal.
Showtime,5.5,38082712,25,"The collective charisma of Robert De Niro, Eddie Murphy, and Rene Russo is the only reason to slap down eight bucks for this limp action/comedy, but then, it's difficult not to want to avert your eyes out of embarrassment for the trio."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,20,"A buddy cop movie that pretends to spoof buddy cop movies along with reality TV shows, Showtime is so lazy and artless that … that …  it saps my will to come up with a good quip: Witless in itself, it is the source of witlessness in others."
Showtime,5.5,38082712,20,Should come with a disclaimer.

"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,50,"Kind of a drag when it resorts to frantic slapstick and tired action-comedy tropes, but modestly engaging during stretches that suggest the project would have worked better as an exuberant musical."
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,40,Hilariously horrible when it isn't just plain awful.
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,40,John Whitesell's extraordinarily witless movie operates as a checklist for cultural and racial clichés.
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,40,Won't likely disappoint fans of men-in-drag comedy but doesn't offer much that's original or funny.
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,33,"Lawrence's gender-bending jokes are played out, and his slapstick is wooden and slow."
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,30,"About the only honestly funny thing in the movie is Faizon Love's uncredited performance in the Joe E. Brown role, as the school maintenance man who's immediately smitten with Big Momma."
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,25,"Star Martin Lawrence, now the sole remaining element from the original ""Big Momma's House"" 11 years ago, looks pretty tired both in and out of makeup here."

"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,11,"The comic, his career now apparently in total free fall, tackles the (dual) role(s) so broadly (no pun intended) that it's just plain annoying."
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,10,A film so drained of entertainment or simple humanity it is difficult to relate to as anything other than industrial artifact.
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,10,"Starved of humor and energy, the interminable Big Mommas: Life Father, Like Son could force Lawrence and co-star Brandon T. Jackson undercover for real."
The Dead Pool,6.3,37903295,88,"The film is smart, quick, and made with real wit. It's never just a crude action movie, bludgeoning us with violence. It's self-aware, it knows who Dirty Harry is and how we react to him, and it has fun with its intelligence. Also, of course, it bludgeons us with violence."
The Dead Pool,6.3,37903295,88,"The Dead Pool isn't the best and brightest of the Dirty Harry films, either, but just as invincible. It's possible that Clint Eastwood and crew are just enjoying a bit of self-mockery with this one."
The Dead Pool,6.3,37903295,70,"An episodic thriller that certainly has its moments, but eventually peters out into dull formula standbys; Eastwood's Harry seems weary of his own sarcastic witticisms, and the ones here won't make anybody's day."
The Dead Pool,6.3,37903295,60,"Fifth entry in the ""Dirty Harry"" series, a definite step backwards from the fascinating and ultimately disturbing progression of Eastwood's character in Sudden Impact."
The Dead Pool,6.3,37903295,60,"This is Dirty Harry's greatest hits, which is a little fun and a little embarrassing. The best part of the film is a warped version of ""Bullitt""'s San Francisco car chase through Pacific Heights."
The Dead Pool,6.3,37903295,50,Unless you're a Clint fan there's little other reason to sit through this one.
The Dead Pool,6.3,37903295,50,"The Dead Pool, possesses a couple of good jokes, but nothing can disguise the fact that it's a mini-movie in the company of a mythic figure."
In Time,6.7,37520095,100,"Coming now, today, In Time is not just satisfying. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's important, because that would overstate it, but it certainly feels like part of the national conversation. It arrives in theaters at a time when people are camped out in New York saying the same things as the people in the movie. It's weird the way films often anticipate the near future."
In Time,6.7,37520095,90,"In Time has so much style and energy that it comes across as an act of boldness rather than just a liberal-minded tract, though of course, it's that too. If there were ever a movie made for the 99 percent, this is it."
In Time,6.7,37520095,75,"To my thinking, the grand simplicity of the metaphor is a big part of In Time's oddly retro sci-fi charm. Niccol is practicing the old-school craft of making a barn-broad alternate-reality that forces you to think about the way we all consensually agree to participate in systems -- even when those systems are hopelessly screwed up."
In Time,6.7,37520095,75,"Justin Timberlake continues to demonstrate that he is a real actor, with screen presence. But after the precise timing and intelligence he brought to ""The Social Network,"" it's a little disappointing to find him in a role that requires less. He has a future in the movies."
In Time,6.7,37520095,70,"A pleasing, often rousing movie for the 99 percent, In Time is not without flaws."
In Time,6.7,37520095,70,Clever and unsettling.
In Time,6.7,37520095,70,"It's a fascinating philosophical conceit delivered as a slick, hyper-stylized conspiracy yarn, juicy enough to deliver on both fronts, provided you don't ask too many questions."
In Time,6.7,37520095,70,"So, yeah - even if In Time descends from its gripping and thought-provoking premise into a mediocre chase thriller before it's over, it's still pretty damn satisfying to watch in the current climate."
In Time,6.7,37520095,63,"The problem with In Time, to the extent that it is a problem, is that an intriguing premise turns into window dressing for a somewhat routine ""Bonnie & Clyde""-meets-""Robin Hood"" action thriller with car chases, heists, and gunplay."
In Time,6.7,37520095,63,"Along the way there are definitely some pleasing distractions, just not enough to obscure the growing realization that a much better picture could have been made, and wasn't. Many films never have a chance, but this one did – it's an opportunity wasted."
In Time,6.7,37520095,63,"All in all, In Time is not just stylish but surprisingly substantial. From now on, you'll think twice every time you hear the phrase ""rollover minutes."""
In Time,6.7,37520095,63,"In Time has about 50 minutes of good movie in it. Alas, the sci-fi thriller runs nearly twice that length, and despite a terrific concept that could make for an ""Inception"" for 2011, we get ""Logan's Run"" meets ""Robin Hood."" And not the good parts."
In Time,6.7,37520095,63,"I like a lot of the film despite its drawbacks; its violence isn't rote or numbing, and there's a simplicity and elegance to the digital-countdown effect."
In Time,6.7,37520095,63,"""Gattaca"" director Andrew Niccol's sense of the zeitgeist is as on the money as ever with In Time, a sci-fi parable that plays like ""Occupy Wall Street: The Movie."""
In Time,6.7,37520095,63,"If you can overlook the lack of logic inherent in its central conceit, In Time makes for a fun, stylish piece of speculative sci-fi."
In Time,6.7,37520095,60,"The pace is solid and engaging without putting you on the edge of your seat-you won't be looking at your watch, which means it's at least worth the time spent."
In Time,6.7,37520095,60,"The tick tick tock of the mortal clock gives the science-fiction thriller In Time its slick, sweet premise."
In Time,6.7,37520095,58,"The movie, I'm sad to report, has a majorly disappointing follow-through. It turns into a noisy, squalling chase movie."
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,It's a great idea that Niccol can't translate into a great movie.
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,"The writer-director Andrew Niccol is best known for writing ""The Truman Show,"" another movie that got carried away by doomsday deep-think. The deep-think here is even sillier."
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,"After a nifty setup, In Time mostly fails to deliver as it gets lamer by the minute."
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,"Andrew Niccol's In Time looks great, sounds stilted and plays like a clever videogame with too many rules."
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,"What's missing are the kind of moments that actually matter, the ones that are so gripping that you want desperately for time to stop - to savor them, to feel the fear, the passion, the regret. Ah, well … maybe next time."
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,Pretty cast. Potent  premise. Piss-poor execution. And so dies In Time.
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,"The movie tries to do for forearms what the loosely similar science-fiction romance ""The Adjustment Bureau'' attempted for men's hats: make them chic."
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,In Time is that kind of movie: Philip K. Dick for knuckleheads.
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,"Much like Niccol's ""Gattaca,"" in which genetic perfection rather than time was the weapon a small group of snobby, unworthy elites used to hold down the meek masses, In Time is a chilly, stiff movie where clever ideas are delivered as self-righteous sermons."
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,"As novel and absorbing as In Time is in several respects, however, Andrew Niccol's latest conception of an altered but still recognizable future feels undernourished in other ways that are not as salutary, preventing the film from fulfilling its strong inherent promise."
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,"Justin Timberlake can't elevate what amounts to relatively simplistic, formulaic material, but his headlining turn exhibits sufficient charisma and wit to make In Time a passably diverting action-packed waste of time."
In Time,6.7,37520095,40,Niccol's attempts at satire are toothless.
In Time,6.7,37520095,40,"Niccol's bizarrely stilted sci-fi thriller In Time, a movie so consistently flat-footed, with pauses between lines of dialogue so vast, that you begin to wonder if the whole thing might be a psychological experiment of some kind...Or has he just made a really dull movie?"
In Time,6.7,37520095,40,"Kartheiser brings some zip and smarm to the proceedings as the villain with a million years in his vault, but it's not nearly enough to make In Time worth your time. Or your money."
In Time,6.7,37520095,38,This future looks awfully passé: The stimulus didn't work out. Neither did 1917 Russia.
In Time,6.7,37520095,20,"They have some fun playacting at class warriors on the lam – and Seyfriend, it must be said, rocks a killer bob – but it's all just big-budget dress-up in a futurescape that reeks of phoniness."
In Time,6.7,37520095,20,"Sadly, for 99% of its running time, this muddled sci-fi drama is filled with enough overplotting, bad acting and riddle-speak dialogue to stop a clock."
In Time,6.7,37520095,16,Niccol fashioned an uninspired and downright dull sci-fi gimmick and doesn't even explain how it happened.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,88,"A blast, the best action movie of the summer."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,83,"When Bekmambetov is in full stride and the gore, oaths and silver bullets are flying, it's a kick.  The title may sound like a joke, but Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is serious fun."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,78,"Benjamin Walker, as Lincoln, may not have the gangly gravitas of Raymond Massey's ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" – he looks like a young Liam Neeson doing a younger Bruce Campbell, frankly – but he does have a sly, self-effacing sense of humor that feels ever so Lincoln-esque"
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,75,"Instead of getting smirky and campy and blowing out the joke in the first few scenes, Grahame-Smith and director Timur Bekmambetov straight-face it. They ask themselves, well, what would it be like if the main struggle of Lincoln's life were with vampires intent on taking over the new world? And they answer the question as realistically and soberly as they can within this loony framework."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,75,"Without a doubt the best film we are ever likely to see on the subject - unless there is a sequel, which is unlikely, because at the end, the Lincolns are on their way to the theater."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,70,"There's definitely some empty-calories, summer-movie fun to be found in this ludicrous genre mashup, most of it courtesy of maniacal Russian director Timur Bekmambetov, who stages hilarious, imaginative, almost free-form action sequences like nobody in the business."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,70,"Genre enthusiasts will lap up the mixture of action and fantasy, while history buffs who don't mind a bit of rewriting will dig into an alternative spin on the Civil War period."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,70,A Civil War-era actioner of questionable taste and historical accuracy but surprisingly consistent entertainment value.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,63,"A stylish slasher of a movie, a monster flick that does its vampires right, if not their real-life counterparts."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,63,Both terribly silly and a lot of fun.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,63,"One expects a movie called Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter to be rich in wit and black humor, but writer Seth Grahame-Smith and director Timur Bekmambetov opt to play things reasonably straight."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,63,The script leaps forward with an absurdity almost as great as Lincoln's own strength.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,60,"Bekmambetov directs with gusto, and the forthright absurdity of the story, combined with its weirdly heartfelt self-belief is winning."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,58,"With so much flesh crunching and bloodletting, it could have been scary as all Walking Dead get-out. Instead, the movie plays safe by cutting every theme down the middle - a swing that's effective when splitting wood or vampire skulls, but dull when applied to filmmaking."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,50,It's not nearly as snappy or campy as it should be-though its self-seriousness is its own kind of entertainment.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,50,"It sounds fun. It's a little fun. For a while. But Bekmanbetov shoots every killing spree like an addled gamer, working that slow-down-speed-up kill-shot cliche like a maniac."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,42,"The training montage where Lincoln learns to twirl his axe around his body like a baton for no apparent purpose is neither the movie's first laughable sequence nor its last, but it sums up the movie's aesthetic: The filmmakers mistakenly think nothing is silly if it's done with a grim enough facial expression."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"It doesn't take long for Bekmambetov to wear out his welcome with a laundry list of generic-looking action sequences: When you've seen one vampire get stabbed in the eyeball, you've seen 'em all."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"Unfortunately, there's also a certain artificiality to the whole film, both visually and narratively."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is such a smashing title it's too bad someone had to spoil things by making a movie to go with it.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"Given the subject matter, an exercise in delicacy and restraint was unlikely, but it's too bad that the film's concept is way more entertaining than what has ended up on-screen."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"The grave tone makes it stiff and leaden, the digi-saturated look is a turn-off. Damnable and disordered."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"The problem with movies based on a single joke is that a single joke is rarely funny enough to sustain the running time of a feature-length film. And with Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, the whole joke is in the title."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"Watching this is like flipping channels randomly between a Masterpiece Theatre drama and a splatter film on Cinemax. If you're like me, you'll stick with the splatter."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"Possible resulting ""fun"" is only slightly mitigated by contemplation of the wearisome decadence of American popular culture."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"What [Bekmambetov] doesn't do is offer us any respite from his 3D CGI barrage, an assault on the senses that makes the bullet John Wilkes Booth fired into the real Abe's noggin seem calming by comparison."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,38,"The biggest high comes from the images evoked by the title alone, or the title in tandem with the movie poster, doesn't it?"
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,38,The movie deserves a stake through the heart.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,25,"A pox upon history and an insult to the 16th president of the United States. It's that, of course - actually, that's the point - but this joyless, deafening cinematic headache commits a different crime. It's a sin against entertainment."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,25,"Other than its campy title, not much about Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is fun."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,25,Enormous in its scope and colossal in its stupidity.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,20,"What I don't understand is why this extended piece of idiocy chose to sink its stinky teeth into our 16th president. If an axe-wielding hero was required, George Washington would have been the better choice, with the Redcoats as bloodsuckers."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,20,"This ludicrous CGI extravaganza, based on the comic horror novel by Seth Grahame-Smith, can stand proudly beside the best-worst of Ed Wood and Uwe Boll."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,20,"This insipid mashup of history lesson and monster flick takes itself semi-seriously, which is truly deadly."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,0,"I didn't know whether to be more offended as a moviegoer or as an American, but I do know I'd rather gargle nitroglycerine than watch this again, though given that the film looks like it were buried under a log cabin for a century, I barely saw it the first time."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,100,It is not merely a thriller but a shocker. It will separate hard-core Jet Li followers from the fair-weather fans.
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,90,"The inventive, often comically horrible fight set pieces will have you standing on your seat cheering like a Viking, and the result is a supremely kinetic and amusing guilty pleasure."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,80,"A veteran of commercials and music videos, director Chris Nahon crowds out too much of the sprawling combat gymnastics, but his film doesn't lack for luxuriously seedy ambience --his Paris is a retro-futurist sewer."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,75,"The Hollywood action genre, sliding into a lazy dependence on computer-generated fakery, needs this authentic kick to the head delivered by Jet Li."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,75,"Jet Li and Bridget Fonda form a terrific bond in this action film. And the choreography adds a nice kick, too."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,75,"This is all grimy, guy on guy fun, right down to the fevered, bad English dialogue."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,75,"Kiss of the Dragon is a straight-ahead star vehicle for the trim and terse Li, whose steady gaze and fist-flying ways are tempered by a gentlemanly mien."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,75,"I like the movie on a simple physical level. There is no deeper meaning and no higher skill involved; just professional action, well-staged and filmed with a certain stylistic elegance."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,70,"The non-fighting parts of Kiss of the Dragon are, despite the presence of co-star Bridget Fonda, completely non-compelling. It's a proud convention in films like this for fans to mark time during exposition, waiting patiently for the action to start up again, and Kiss is very much in that tradition."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,70,"Slick, straight-ahead action-thriller that marks a small step back and two bounding leaps forward for toplined Jet Li."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,70,"Mr. Li will come out of Kiss of the Dragon smelling like a rose; the combat couldn't be better. But next time around, he should leave the script to more capable hands."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,67,"This is a garish, rocket-fueled slice of popcorn mayhem, and the perfect antidote to this summer's limp action lineup."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,63,"The action scenes, including one on that tourist sightseeing staple, the Bateau Mouche, were directed by Cory Yuen with some creative touches, including a hail of chopsticks during a fight in a restaurant kitchen."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,63,"Seeing this movie won't get you into MIT, but it's passable fun."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,63,"Will probably please hard-core action fans who have become inured to plot idiocies, but it remains a terrible waste of talent."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,60,"The story is formulaic, but this brutal, fast-paced thriller makes excellent use of Li's martial arts prowess."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,50,The new sexism -- the old sexism plus the idea that everything is ironic -- is getting old.
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,50,Lively but incredibly dumb.
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,50,"Offers just about a kill a minute, but less than a thrill a minute."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,42,"Too bad the filmmakers -- and here's where the American part comes in -- decided the movie had to have some heart, too."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,40,"The most dispiriting thing about Kiss of the Dragon, is that it's another example of how Western filmmakers fall on their faces when they try to evoke the feel of Hong Kong action films."
Kiss of the Dragon,6.6,36845124,40,Li is powerless when the film slows to a crawl to provide a little drama.
The Getaway,7.5,36734619,83,Brutal but hugely entertaining.
The Getaway,7.5,36734619,80,"Peckinpah's own control of the escalating frenzy is masterly; this is one of his coldest films, but a great thriller."
The Getaway,7.5,36734619,75,"This violent film, typical of Peckinpah's slam-bang action movies, relentlessly depicts ruthless robbery and murder, not to mention adultery, kidnaping, bribery, extortion, and general mayhem. The vivid direction and lightning pace, however, make the film completely fascinating."
The Getaway,7.5,36734619,70,"The Getaway has several things going for it: Sam Peckinpah's hard-action direction, this time largely channeled into material destruction, although fast-cut human bloodlettings occur frequently enough, and Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw as stars."
The Getaway,7.5,36734619,60,Intense direction (Pekinpah) coupled with assured acting (McQueen).
The Getaway,7.5,36734619,50,"Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway is a big, glossy, impersonal mechanical toy. It's like one of those devices for executive desks, with the stainless steel balls on the strings: It functions with great efficiency but doesn't accomplish anything."
The Getaway,7.5,36734619,50,The action and the violence of The Getaway are supported by no particular themes whatsoever. The movie just unravels.
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,80,"All of that combines to make Colombiana into a scandalous blend of action, sex and violence. My apologies in advance for having so much fun."
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,75,"In catsuits, swimsuits, and skimpy underthings, Saldana is as potently elusive as a shadow can be."
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,70,"The Olivier Megaton-directed Colombiana may not be the brainiest of actioners, but one of the merits of producer Luc Besson's latest brainchild is that fanboys worldwide will come away with a scrap of horticultural knowledge as well as a pretty good time."
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,63,"Colombiana isn't the last word in action movies, but it's a fun ride. And so wrong."
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,63,"Zaldana is such a sultry and surprisingly heartfelt executioner that she often finds a way to make this by-the-numbers genre retread feel, if not fresh, then at least sporadically electric."
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,63,"Saldana is in top form for the acrobatics required in the role, and she makes the gritty determination of her character believable."
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,60,"Saldana makes this watchable, James supplies a fitful plausibility, and director Olivier Megaton (a former graffiti artist) keeps things racing along, preposterously."
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,60,"Zoe Saldana makes being an action hero look so easy in Colombiana, you have to wonder why more actresses don't try it."
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,60,The jittery aesthetic is a bit grating - there's a three-cut minimum per roundhouse kick - but the spectacularly named Olivier Megaton (Transporter 3) still manages to deliver the action-film goods.
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,58,"It uses a story about family as a vehicle for glorifying gangsterism. In other words, it's empty, amoral, and - in the style of other Besson productions - surprisingly easy to digest."
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,50,"Possibly worth seeing if you are 13, as the hot Rihanna-looking chick shows sideboob."
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,50,"It's basically a blaxploitation movie stretched to meaninglessly international proportions that leans on tired Colombian stereotypes. But if Saldana's aiming to be some kind of new Pam Grier, she needs to save more than herself."
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,50,"Colombiana is silly fun at first, but as her break-ins and escapes grow absurdly complex - and her motivations increasingly muddy - it turns into the same silly stuff we've seen before, a dish of revenge served not so much cold as reheated."
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,50,"Colombiana, though, doesn't quite qualify as a chick flick. The filmmakers were surely thinking of the guys when they arranged for Saldana to play many of her scenes in a cat suit, a bikini or lingerie."
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,50,"The overall effect is distancing; there are some early comic moments that have you laughing along with the movie, but eventually the clashing tones and preposterousness just have you laughing."
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,50,"While most action films fall apart because they succumb to stupidity, Colombiana suffers most because it tries to be too smart."
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,50,"There are guilty pleasures to be had in this frenzied B starring Zoe Saldana (Avatar, Star Trek), who gives an acrobatic performance that makes the overcooked material watchable, if not entirely enjoyable."
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,40,Luc Besson's Jumping Frog Action Factory looks mighty lame in Colombiana.
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,40,A movie so addicted to the crack pipe of delirious cinematic badness that it has real potential as a camp classic.
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,38,"As straight exploitation, it's amusing, in fits and starts. It's just that Colombiana lacks the kinetic energy of ""The Transporter"" and the pathos of ""La Femme Nikita."""
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,20,"Colombiana is one long megayawn; I'd have garnered more titillating thrills rewatching freckle-faced Russkie sexbomb Natalya Rudakova strut her leggy, sassy stuff in Megaton and Besson's ""Transporter 3."""
Colombiana,6.4,36665854,12,"Luc Besson keeps ralphing up scripts about beautiful lady killers, but that doesn't mean you have to keep seeing them. Case in point: Colombiana...[a] dull cable-TV-quality item."

Taxi: The Maximum,4.5,36611066,40,I expected this to be much funnier: Latifah coasts on her charm and Fallon seems incapable of playing an actual character.
Taxi: The Maximum,4.5,36611066,40,"Full of car chases, weak jokes and scenes so meandering they make ""Saturday Night Live"" look like a paragon of brevity and wit."
Taxi: The Maximum,4.5,36611066,40,Very little of it works.
Taxi: The Maximum,4.5,36611066,38,"Throughout this Americanization of the Luc Bessonscripted French hit, Latifah itches to check her watch, Fallon appears mortified, and only Ann-Margret mainlines any comic adrenalin."
Taxi: The Maximum,4.5,36611066,30,"A bland, half-finished film that seems to have been conceived as off-peak cable fodder."
Taxi: The Maximum,4.5,36611066,30,"Queen Latifah is a natural-born charmer, but there's only so much she can do when paired with a costar so irritating it's hard not to squirm when he's on the screen, which is most of the time."
Taxi: The Maximum,4.5,36611066,30,"This thoroughly repetitive, ill-conceived and poorly executed effort -- with an emphasis on the word ""effort"" -- defeats these two talented people more often than not."
Taxi: The Maximum,4.5,36611066,30,Commits any number of comedic violations during an aimless pursuit of laughs.

Taxi: The Maximum,4.5,36611066,30,Feels stitched together from bits and pieces of lame '80s buddy-cop movies.
Taxi: The Maximum,4.5,36611066,30,"The glitch, beyond the rote story, is that while she's an infectiously upbeat screen presence, Latifah is not, inherently, a major laugh generator, and neither, it would appear, is Fallon."
Taxi: The Maximum,4.5,36611066,30,"Bad as he is, Fallon cannot claim Taxi's worst moment. That belongs to Ann-Margret."
Taxi: The Maximum,4.5,36611066,25,"Taxi's only saving grace is an inexplicable, though delightful, turn by Ann-Margret as Andy's ever-tipsy mom. She's a stitch, and about 100 times better than her surrounding material."
Taxi: The Maximum,4.5,36611066,25,"In a film that is wall-to-wall idiocy, the most tiresome delusion is that car chases are funny."

Taxi: The Maximum,4.5,36611066,25,This witless action comedy begins to insult the audience's intelligence from the opening scene.
Taxi: The Maximum,4.5,36611066,12,Very nearly as entertaining as watching a potato bake.
Death Race,6.4,36316032,80,"The movie is legitimately greasy, authentically nasty, with a good old-fashioned sense of laying waste to everything in sight -- including the shallow philosophizing and computer-generated fakery that have overrun the summer blockbuster."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,75,"Nothing in director Paul W.S. Anderson's schlock drawer--prepares you for the peppy, good-time nastiness that is Death Race."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,75,It honestly delivers the goods without all the preachy moralizing about violent entertainment and cultural ruin.
Death Race,6.4,36316032,75,"Statham is an essential tough guy, what the Brits call ""well'ard,"" as self-assured as Lee Marvin."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,70,"Statham moves with such easy grace that you don't have to work hard to believe him. And if he can stand up to Joan Allen, melting her predatory stare with his own molten gaze, then it's clear he's not just the prettiest guy on the prison block, but also the toughest."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,70,"Though the picture doesn't deserve to appear on any critic's 10-best list, it observes the minimum standards of modern action films, which is to say it looks smarter, talks sassier and moves faster than almost anything else on the market."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,67,"This new version has absolutely none of the distinctive tongue-in-cheek black humor that was the keynote of its model and the trademark of its original director, Paul Bartel."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,67,"Soft sexual and racial jabs replace the more daring political commentary of the original, a crude classic from the Roger Corman factory."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,63,"This movie is about mayhem on wheels, tough guys viewers can root for, and villains whose comeuppances audiences crave. That's what Death Race is all about and, for what it is, it does a solid job."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,63,Death Race is our unshaven Brit hero's inevitable comeuppance: The Prison Job.
Death Race,6.4,36316032,63,"Smartly, Anderson makes some eclectic casting choices that keep the story from feeling as though it's populated by video-game characters."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,60,"It's nothing more than an enjoyable, ridiculously macho B-movie romp, but it's derson' best movie since the underrated Event Horizon. Perhaps, at long last, he' starting to find his - yep - top gear."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,58,"It's the perfect end-of-summer film, and a sign that summer needs to end soon."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,40,"The best you can say about the movie is that it isn't boring. It's fast-paced, but it isn't really well made."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,38,"OK, so no plot, really."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,30,"It isn't so much a movie as a superheated, highly conductive miracle substance for the pure transmission of masculine aggression and misogyny."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,30,"As hard as metal and just as dumb, Paul W.S. Anderson's Death Race couldn't be further from producer Roger Corman and director Paul Bartel's goofy, bloody 1975 original, ""Death Race 2000."""
Death Race,6.4,36316032,30,"Paul Bartel's ""Death Race 2000"" is a beloved camp item, but this slick, loud, violent remake is pitched at the video game crowd."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,30,"Well, you've got to say this for Death Race:  It knows what it is and doesn't apologize for it. What it is, incidentally, is junk."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,25,An ill-advised and severely wussified remake.
Death Race,6.4,36316032,20,"With its inexplicably watchable shotgun-riding bimbos, unconscious homoeroticism and ""Shawshank Redemption"" ending, The Fast and the Frivolous here is almost so bad it's good. Almost..."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,12,"It is an assault on all the senses, including common. Walking out, I had the impression I had just seen the video game and was still waiting for the movie."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,0,"Anderson has neutered the original film's outrageously transgressive macadam mayhem and completely stripped the story of its pointedly political social satire, making this Death Race one of the most boring drags of all time."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,0,Here's hoping Allen's static Hennessey is due to an extreme acting choice and not plastic surgery. It would be tragic to lose a natural smile to star in garbage like Death Race.
Universal Soldier,6,36299898,63,"It may be standard-issue stuff, but it looks great and it almost makes you nostalgic for the days when stuntmen reigned supreme and mayhem and computers never knew how much they had in common."
Universal Soldier,6,36299898,60,"By its own deliriously rock-bottom standards, ""Universal"" ain't half bad.  Of course, you have to be big on bloody slaughter, kickboxing, infrared gunning and impaired acting. But ""Universal"" executes its subtle-free mission with surprisingly watchable efficiency."
Universal Soldier,6,36299898,60,"The film is actually fairly well made, with a brisk tempo pace, a professional look and enough competently staged action."
Universal Soldier,6,36299898,50,"I suppose there is a market for this sort of thing among bubblebrained adolescents of all ages, but it takes a good chase scene indeed to rouse me from the lethargy induced by dozens and dozens of essentially similar sequences."
Universal Soldier,6,36299898,50,"Viewers primed for a postapocalyptic blowout will be disappointed to learn that Universal Soldier is set in the boring old present day, and that until the climactic clash the film is slow-moving and short on firepower."
Universal Soldier,6,36299898,50,"As the robotic duo, Lundgren and Van Damme have found roles tailored to their acting abilities."
Universal Soldier,6,36299898,50,"In an equally damning commentary on the acting and Roland Emmerich’s direction, Lundgren and Van Damme are both more realistic as stoic cadavers than they are once their memories start to return."
Universal Soldier,6,36299898,33,"Mr. Lundgren, who glowers his way all too convincingly through the role of a rabid bully, may well be the only man in the universe who can make Mr. Van Damme look like an actor."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,80,"Punchy and confronting, with another terrific turn from Seimetz."

The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,75,Implausible yet enjoyably diverting thriller.
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,75,A well-constructed and genuinely tense thriller.
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,70,"An unassuming thriller, a nifty piece of genre filmmaking without frills or self-importance. It's a throwback, if you will, to the days of B pictures, when formula movies were made with a maximum of skill and a minimum of pretense."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,63,"Director Clark Johnson has an energetic style of filmmaking and a facile way with stunts and chase sequences. The result is a fairly stylish action thriller. We've seen plenty of suspense films in which a seemingly good guy is framed, so it helps when a director can pull off a few cinematic tricks to keep audiences on their toes."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,63,"Director Clark Johnson and screenwriter George Nolfi (adapting the novel by Gerald Petievich) do an excellent job of setting things up and getting the story underway. Unfortunately, some of their hard work is undone during the movie's final third."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,63,"Ultimately all of the ado about men in shades and dark suits running around shooting and shouting at each other comes to a satisfying, if predictable, conclusion."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,60,"A slick enough thriller about a presidential assassination attempt. It is also a rather mechanical, soulless affair that avoids politics or anything else that might clearly define who these characters are and why we should care."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,58,"No, it's not the big screen version of ""24."" For one thing, Sutherland is in the wrong role."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,58,"The Sentinel moves quickly and never becomes a bore. It does become something of a cartoon, though, which proves a major letdown for a movie that aims for something far more intelligent."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,58,We have reached a point in history when an ordinary TV show is often as good as or even better than an ordinary movie. And movies don't come much more ordinary than The Sentinel.
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,50,"Sentinel works overtime to suggest what a thrill-a-minute world its characters inhabit; but only during the last 20 minutes does the movie's pulse (or ours) raise above a flatline. The actors look uniformly unhappy to be there - except for Basinger, who seems lost in a lithium haze."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,50,"Amid the nervousness Douglas and Sutherland do what they can to enliven their warring stereotypes. And now and then, blessedly, The Sentinel nudges toward camp."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,50,"A half-hearted exercise in political paranoia, The Sentinel unravels its wrong-man scenario with business-like efficiency and an impressively jittery visual scheme, but falls far short of providing visceral or emotional thrills."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,50,"The Sentinel is so bland that it wants only to be as good as TV. Not as good as good TV, like ""24."" It merely aspires to be the Regis Philbin of D.C. thrillers. It isn't trying to dazzle you with style, complexity or intelligence."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,50,A contrived and tepid thriller that insists on wanting to interest us in its main plot -- the usual nefarious plan to assassinate the leader of the free world.
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,50,"Douglas and Sutherland do crackling hostility with devilish glee, and the fireworks are nothing if not entertaining."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,50,"The Sentinel isn't an entire season of ''24"" smushed into a bland two hours of movie? Does Kiefer Sutherland know?"
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,50,"The movie gives away its shifty-eyed villain almost immediately. What it doesn't give away is why he betrayed his trust, who wants the president dead or what they hope to gain by killing him."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,50,"The Sentinel isn't nearly as slick as it must have looked on the page. Those zingers are perfect fodder for a movie preview, but they just don't lead anywhere interesting on-screen."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,50,Eva Longoria brings a crisp swagger and fluent Spanish to her role.
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,50,"Director Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T.) has a flair for action, which compensates for the flattening effect of Gabriel Beristain's cinematography."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,50,"Always an intriguing (though sometimes unpolished) actress, Basinger has softened the rough edges over the years to become an extremely watchable performer who deserves better roles than those in which she appears onscreen."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,42,"Looking back, 1993 was a golden age for thriller cinema. That was the year Hollywood hatched both ""In the Line of Fire"" and ""The Fugitive,"" the two obvious and way superior antecedents for the very humdrum B-movie mash-up The Sentinel."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,40,Sentinel is a medium-dumb thriller that starts out with momentary promise but gets progressively sillier.
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,40,"The screenwriters seem to have meticulously researched the inner workings of the White House by watching DVDs of ""The West Wing,"" but, despite their hard work, casting sinks the film. With Longoria and Sutherland onboard it feels like an uneasy marriage of ""24"" and ""Desperate Housewives."""
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,40,"Plays like a 108 minute episode of Hawaii 5-0, minus the exotic locale."
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,30,"The question is why. Why would a star of Michael Douglas's stature and intelligence attach himself to a Washington thriller as deeply ridiculous, suspense-free and potentially career-damaging as The Sentinel?"
The Sentinel,6.1,36280697,30,"Brought low by its premise and rendered idiotic by its subplot, this alleged political thriller spells momentary doom for star Michael Douglas."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,100,"Ryan Gosling in a physical action-comedy? Whoever thought of the idea should be crowned genius of the year. With dynamite timing and uproarious gestures, Gosling mines his diverse abilities and becomes a blast in The Nice Guys."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,91,Half of the best gags in The Nice Guys are of the physical variety. Some of the action scenes escalate into full-on live-action Looney Tunes madness.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,91,"The Nice Guys, which the screenwriter also directed, is the best of Black’s films. It is eccentrically, sometimes broadly funny, with top-notch performances from Crowe and Gosling and a pitch-perfect sense of timing to help smooth over some of the script’s fault lines and blind spots."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,90,"To sum it all up, The Nice Guys is basically “Chinatown” remade by Quentin Tarantino and starring foulmouthed, updated versions of Abbott and Costello, as played by two of the most recognizable male stars of our time."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,90,"The Nice Guys is an ultra-violent burlesque, the sort of cheerfully hostile buddy bash that’s been a staple since the ’80s, only this one is singularly clever about its own triviality, and it offers the scruffy pleasure of seeing two great actors dial down their gravitas with style."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,88,"It’s all delightfully fizzy, bloody fun – even if there’s the teeniest, tiniest hint of sequel ambitions."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,88,Is this a family film? No way. Does it include scenes that some may find painful to watch? You bet. Will you be entertained? Thoroughly.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,83,"It is an easy sit, a big fat slice of smart entertainment. Constantly funny, startlingly violent, and oddly heartfelt, The Nice Guys is a grown-up delight, a perfect antidote to the nonstop barrage of effects spectacle that normally marks the summer movie season."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,83,"The Nice Guys spends nearly two hours treating Crowe and Gosling like a pair of piñatas, beating them mercilessly and unapologetically, and it’s watching them crawl out from underneath and towards some form of redemption that makes the film a genuine smash."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,80,"Quick on its wits and fast with its fists, this is Black firmly back doing what he does best. And nobody out there does it better."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,80,Should be called ‘The Funny Guys’. The Crowe/Gosling partnership drives Black’s lurid comedy at top speed. Enormously entertaining.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,80,"Black’s general atmosphere of resigned melancholy fits perfectly with The Nice Guys and its portrait of sleazy 1970s Los Angeles, the ideal setting for a filmmaker interested in faded dreams and broken dreamers."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,80,"The porn, the drugs, the smog, the bad haircuts - you can play it for laughs or play it straight. With terrific performances from Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, Black does a little of both. The film is at once a nod to hard-boiled film noir and a send-up of it."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,80,"As summer popcorn-style entertainment, The Nice Guys gets the job done."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,80,The Nice Guys could well mark the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Black has really thrown the kitchen sink at his latest project and it all works tremendously. Let's hope there's more to come.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,80,[Black] creates some outrageously contrived and protracted shootouts and one or two good old fashioned action explosions. But he also keeps the dialogue cracking along.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,80,"Think of The Nice Guys as candy noir: all the key ingredients from mysteries such as Chinatown and The Long Goodbye poured into a tall glass, then topped up with sugar syrup, a spritz of club soda, a sprig of mint and an ironic paper parasol."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,77,"While the characters are distinctive and charming, and the dialogue is often pretty funny, The Nice Guys is a large step down on the ambition scale from Kiss Kiss. Having deconstructed his favorite genre so perfectly, Black has a harder time reconstructing it without leaving out some pieces."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"Laughter trumps logic here, and the laughs flow freely."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"The cast is perfect, but The Nice Guys could have used one more rewrite or two and another trip to the editing bay to really streamline jokes that don’t work and a plot that gets more cluttered than engaging."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"The film overflows with quips, irony, and physical gags while at the same time relating a noir-tinged story of seedy corruption set in the neon-saturated underbelly of the 1977 Los Angeles porn industry."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"Some editing would have made The Nice Guys easier to love — at times it feels as bloated as Crowe’s gut. It’s neither as fast, fresh or as funny as Black’s “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang’’ (2005)."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"Like Shane Black's directing debut, ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" with Robert Downey, Jr., his The Nice Guys borrows from noir traditions and pulp fiction, throwing a fresh coat of smart-alecky comedy over the whole thing."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,Brews up an enticing murder mystery and gives Shane Black — who directed and co-wrote the script — another hit on-screen pairing.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"Angourie Rice, who plays Gosling’s intelligent and highly moral 12-year-old, deserves a special mention. The character is an unexpected presence that adds dimension to the story, and Rice plays her beautifully."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,The Nice Guys is funny enough when it sticks to its heroes — whether pinned in a tight spot or bickering with each other — that its less-than-compelling intrigues and digressions come as an acceptable trade-off.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"The Nice Guys has a little extra padding that isn’t necessary.... Ah, but Crowe and Gosling save the day."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"Gosling and Crowe have a surprisingly fizzy, ferret-and-bull chemistry, and the hedonistic Me Decade setting is groovy.... But the one-liners and shoot-outs feel a bit threadbare, handed down from older, better Shane Black movies."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"Shane Black's The Nice Guys doesn't want for great exchanges, and even disposable conversations brim with acidic wit."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,The Nice Guys delivers enough brilliant physical comedy to smooth over its blunter narrative devices.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,72,"There’s a tipping point at which comedy goes from black to bilious, and that’s a balancing act that The Nice Guys doesn’t always nail. The laughs from this frequently entertaining action comedy get stuck in the throat, keeping this altogether good movie from being a great one."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,70,"The Nice Guys has a nice feel: just slick enough to keep from falling apart, just brutal enough to keep from seeming inconsequential."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,70,The modest pleasures of The Nice Guys lie not in following the wiggy story twists but in watching Gosling and Crowe mix it up and mess everything up.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,70,"A consistently entertaining, frequently violent and generally slapdash action comedy."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,70,"As an action comedy, R-rated division, The Nice Guys is hard to beat. Black knows how to pace and escalate a fight and a film, and he springs wicked surprises all along — scene after scene dances around trapdoors that the audience falls into."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,70,"Why see this film? Partly because of the leading men, but mainly because of a girl. An Australian actress named Angourie Rice plays March’s daughter, Holly, who is thirteen."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,67,"For a good portion of Black's film, all this mayhem is great fun, since Russell Crowe is obviously funnier than he has ever allowed himself to appear, and Ryan Gosling is funnier than he has already proven. Together they form a deliciously dumb action duo; one brawn, the other sort of has a brain."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,67,"I’m not sure I’ve laughed harder all year than at Gosling in a bathroom stall, accidentally dropping a lit cigarette down his pants leg."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,63,"Is it fun? Parts, yes, and many will get exactly what they wanted from The Nice Guys."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,63,"It should have worked, and it almost does, but Black buries his characters in a sputtering, chaotic story, seeming to realize only sporadically that we aren’t watching this film for the plot and the stunts...but for the byplay between the two main characters. And — who knew? — Crowe and Gosling have comic chemistry to burn."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,63,"For a movie predicated on slapstick forward momentum, we spend an awful lot of time driving backward."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,63,There are even times when Black seems to be letting Crowe and Gosling make the whole thing up as they go along. Not a bad thing.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,63,"The characters in The Nice Guys often ask each other if they’re good or bad, a choice the movie doesn’t want to force the audience to make. Instead it settles for making good on the title, occupying the nice, mushy middle — perhaps unfocused and off-balance at times, but conveying a sense of buoyancy that’s as cheerfully contagious as it is freewheeling."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,63,"The Nice Guys never lives up to the promise of its hilarious first 10 minutes, but Crowe and Gosling are good enough to leave you hoping for a sequel."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,63,"The porn industry of the era is as much a part of the movie as the classic cars (re-used in the background, in scene after scene) and the leisure suits. But the zingers, which fall off markedly in the latter third when the energy flags and the plot unravels, always pack a punch."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,60,"Though the plot here may be a confusing, multi-threaded mess (which may in fact be the script’s truest homage to Chandler), it’s occasionally offset by the exuberance with which Black blends splatter and slapstick, and the leeway he grants his two very game leads."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,60,"This is a dumb movie pretending to be smart, even as it wants you to believe the opposite. Still, dumb can be fun."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,60,"The Nice Guys harks back to the 70s golden age of revisionist detective thrillers, but the result feels too knowingly déja vu, rather than bringing a truly fresh angle."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,50,"The violence is cartoonishly garish and the yuks are few. Crowe, looking (deliberately I presume) flabby and somnolent, is more dead than deadpan, and Gosling, who appears at times to be doing a Lou Costello impression, is, to put it mildly, not in his element."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,50,"That the film mostly falls flat has far more to do with the largely unconvincing material rather than with the co-stars, who are more than game for often clownish shenanigans Black and his co-writer Anthony Bagarozzi have concocted for them; in fit and starts, the actors display a buoyant comic rapport."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,0,"This one, by the jarringly untalented writer-director Shane Black, is merely violent, vulgar and stupid."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,100,"This is a movie that strains at the leash of the possible, a movie of great visionary wonders."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,100,"It closes the trilogy like a lightning blast followed by the ominous, resonant drone of thunder. Great action sequences crop up frequently today, but great action movies are always few and far between. Beyond Thunderdome is one, every bit as much as its two predecessors."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,100,"This middle portion of the picture becomes dangerously preachy, but just before we and Max are bored, director Miller returns Max to his roots, a screaming chase sequence through a desertlike Australian landscape."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,88,"This film has showier stunts than its predecessors, and a better sense of humor. It also has Tina Turner, in chain-mail stockings."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,80,"Gibson impressively fleshes out Max, Tina Turner is striking in her role as Aunty (as well as contributing two topnotch songs, which open and close the picture) and the juves are uniformly good."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,80,Disjointed but it still rocks.
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,80,"Miller unveils some marvellously original cinematic snaps (the lost city of the feral children; Master Blaster, the dwarf-powered giant; Thunderdome itself); and if the thrills and special effects lack a little of the punch of Mad Max 2, there's still enough imagination, wit and ingenuity to put recent Spielberg to shame."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,80,The battle between Max and The Blaster in Beyond Thunderdome may be the best the series has to offer.
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,80,"Its high-bounding excesses of action simultaneously satisfy and satirize the passion for heedless viciousness that so profoundly moves the action film's prime audience, urban adolescent males."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,75,"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome isn't a bad movie. It has entertaining sections, decent performances and more than a few provocative images. But it also has a major shortcoming: It's too darned sane."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,70,"The Thunderdome sequence is an amazing display of imagination and technical skill, but the film falls apart with the climactic chase scene."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,60,"The directors, George Miller and George Ogilvie, borrow from every source they can find; movie buffs can pass the time spotting the Lynch shot, the Leone shot, the Jodorowski shot, and all kinds of others."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,60,"The punky energy of the earlier films has given way to a self-conscious striving for significance, obscuring Miller's considerable kinetic talents in favor of a lumpy didacticism."
The Island,6.9,35818913,75,"Bay's movie couldn't be more timely; whatever you think about this subject, you might admire his attempt to come to grips with it in a summer blockbuster."
The Island,6.9,35818913,75,"It's got a hot premise, some cool sets, attractive stars and action that lets up only when it thinks you're about to surrender."
The Island,6.9,35818913,75,"The Island runs 136 minutes, but that's not long for a double feature. The first half of Michael Bay's new film is a spare, creepy science fiction parable, and then it shifts into a high-tech action picture. Both halves work."
The Island,6.9,35818913,75,"Bay's best film since ""The Rock."""
The Island,6.9,35818913,75,"The movie is more about how many things Michael Bay can smash up -- lots. That might not be a talent most people respect, but it gets through to people anyway, and here Bay does it exceptionally well."
The Island,6.9,35818913,70,"Starts off an aggressively derivative sci-fi thriller, then morphs into an above-average chase melodrama."
The Island,6.9,35818913,70,"Glossy, witty eye candy with some moderately chewy stuff in the middle. This lavish, exhaustingly kinetic film is smarter than you might expect, and at the same time dumber than it could be. It's an impressive product: a triumph of cloning that almost convinces you that it possesses a soul."
The Island,6.9,35818913,67,Make no mistake: This not high art. But it does its job without insulting our intelligence or unpleasantly jangling our nerves.
The Island,6.9,35818913,67,The final third...is so overblown and anticlimactic that it finally gets you thinking about empty profundity and loose ends.
The Island,6.9,35818913,63,There's enough fun to be had that it's almost possible to ignore the stupidity of the story and the cavity that replaces character development.
The Island,6.9,35818913,63,"Bay's strength as a filmmaker, the reason his superficial yet entertaining productions can never be completely ignored, is that he appears to lack shame. He'll blow anything up and run anybody over. The moral complexities don't matter to him. He just wants to stage spectacles, appreciate very good-looking people, and assert his cowboy aesthetic."
The Island,6.9,35818913,63,"As the careening cars go splat, splat, splat, the director's vision of the future looks like a cheerfully mindless combination of two extremes of carnival entertainment: demolition derby and whack-a-mole."
The Island,6.9,35818913,63,"Scarlett Johansson looks lovely and hasn't much to do besides that, McGregor only starts having fun when he's playing the ""original"" of his clone."
The Island,6.9,35818913,60,"Frenetic actioner about refugees from a genetic cloning plant starts off intriguingly, burns up its ideas in the first hour and pads out the rest with joltingly repetitive action sequences."
The Island,6.9,35818913,60,"This is pure essence of Bay--it's big, it's loud, it has no context, and if you show up tanked, I'm sure it's really quite poetic."
The Island,6.9,35818913,60,"There is nothing wrong with the action sequences beyond their sheer length and number. They're in the ""Road Warrior"" mode: hyper-fast and vicious."
The Island,6.9,35818913,60,"Like its slack-jawed clones, The Island is full of energy and incredibly pretty but burdened with only the minimum of smarts."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"For all the menace of its techno-prattle, its implicit boosts for humanism and its swell production design, the picture is finally a bore. Sci-fi was more powerful when its special effects were cheap and crude, its ideas simple but potently stated."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"The Island begins with a whimper of interest as a cool-hued, cautionary exploration of the ethics of cloning, and ends, in a hail of product placement, with a dumb bang."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"As usual, Hollywood hitmeister Bay is more interested in blowing stuff up than in addressing deep questions like the morality of science and the false myths of civilization, and these explosions go on for over two hours."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,Nary an original idea abounds in The Island.
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"Classic Bay, except it's missing the crass director's fine-tuned rhythm, his feel for adrenaline, his breakneck edits and sense of humor."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"The best thing about The Island is this: Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson, buffed and dressed in sparkling white, wondering how and when to kiss each other."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"The first half is high-quality science fiction, the rest is a high-tech chase adventure with a gleeful yen for destructive thrills."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"The Island could be read as a metaphor for societal ills (commercialization, conformity, pharmaceutical overkill) if it weren't so shamelessly dumb. And dumb it is."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"Chases, crashes and explosions are thick on the land in the second half of this movie, but though they are expertly done, their size, frequency and increasing disconnection from what was once a coherent story leave you feeling pummeled rather than exhilarated."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"This frenzied fiesta of firepower is about cloning people for spare parts, but the movie is a clone itself. Possessing no new ideas, it reworks and borrows from such films as ""Blade Runner,"" ""The Matrix"" and ""Logan's Run."""
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"For a slick pop entertainment, more than the usual quotient of timely ideas rattle around between the relentless product placements and futuristic geegaws."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"Steve Buscemi supplies the only spark of intelligent life in this numbingly flat universe, despite the fancy gadgets, the high-speed chases, and a skyscraper collision reminiscent of the World Trade Center attacks."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"Like ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" The Island is the kind of suicidal high-concept movie increasingly prevalent these days: a film so thoroughly pre-conceived and pre-sold that most audiences know more about what's going on than the characters do for half the movie."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"Unfortunately, The Island grows dumber as it goes along, gradually disintegrating into a generic good-versus-evil spectacular that not only defies all known laws of gravity and physics, but also suffers from the lack of morality that plagues Bay's films."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"The Island walks a weird, wobbly line between being stupid, falsely fattened-up entertainment and a picture that just might have possibly been made by a person with a brain -- a scrambled one, but a brain nonetheless."
The Island,6.9,35818913,40,What makes this movie so inadequate is that there are some moments in it that could have been really worth watching.
The Island,6.9,35818913,40,"An overblown science-fiction epic in which ostensibly unthinking, unfeeling stem-cell-like entities not only think and feel, but look and act like glamorous movie stars."
The Island,6.9,35818913,38,"A borrowed idea -- hello, ""Blade Runner,"" hi there, ""Matrix"" -- but an idea nonetheless."
The Island,6.9,35818913,30,"If you like ""Maxim,"" you will love The Island. It is glossy. It is expensive. It has lots of slick ads for Aquafina and Cadillac."
The Island,6.9,35818913,30,"If you find yourself at ""The Island"" I have only three words of advice: Vote yourself off."
Sharky's Machine,6.3,35610100,80,"Sharky’s Machine contains all of the ingredients of a tough, violent, cynical big-city cop movie, but what makes it intriguing is the way the Burt Reynolds character plays against those conventions."
Sharky's Machine,6.3,35610100,75,"Mr. Reynolds's third and best directorial effort - the first two were Gator and The End - is an unexpectedly accomplished cop thriller. There is, as is often the case with movies of that genre, less here than meets the eye: the plot has its unreasonable spots, and the story doesn't come to much in the end. But one measure of the success of Sharky's Machine is that it's too fast and exciting for those considerations to count until after the movie is over."
Sharky's Machine,6.3,35610100,70,"Directing himself in Sharky’s Machine, Burt Reynolds has combined his own macho personality with what’s popularly called mindless violence to come up with a seemingly guaranteed winner [from the novel by William Diehl]."
Sharky's Machine,6.3,35610100,70,"Directing his own starring vehicle, that sly boots Burt Reynolds gives the audience a shamelessly lurid but stylish going-over, while putting a clever new wrinkle or two on his own status."
Sharky's Machine,6.3,35610100,70,"Unfortunately, Reynolds the director is as uncertain about the tone of the picture as Reynolds the star is about his screen persona. So while the action veers from lightweight action to extreme violence, Reynolds' character vacillates between macho tough guy and sensitive, vulnerable leading man."
Sharky's Machine,6.3,35610100,63,"Burt Reynolds showed signs of becoming a very personal filmmaker with this police thriller, his third outing as a director. It has the wistful faith in innocence and the extreme moral outrage of Gator coupled with the subversive infantilism of The End; what Reynolds lacks in technique (which is plenty) is nearly compensated for by the almost embarrassing intensity of his feelings. The context is extremely violent, which makes the intimate moments—between Reynolds and the girl and Reynolds and his buddies—stand out in agonizingly stark relief."
Sharky's Machine,6.3,35610100,50,"Reynolds was coasting at this point of his career, with zero risk-taking it ends up as a soulless, below-average movie."
No Way Out,7.1,35509515,100,Good performances from a strong cast and paranoid plotting enough to keep even the staunchest of remake nay-sayers quiet. Hitchockian production with a modern twist.
No Way Out,7.1,35509515,100,"No Way Out has the exuberance of something freshly conceived. It's so effective, in fact, that when it's all over, you might want to sit through the beginning again just to see if the end is justified by the means. I suspect that it is."
No Way Out,7.1,35509515,100,"A thriller that grabs you even before the ironies of its plot kick in is a thriller you don't want to miss. No Way Out is that sort of movie, a thriller that's thrilling throughout."
No Way Out,7.1,35509515,100,"No Way Out is a superior example of the genre, a film in which a simple situation grows more and more complex until it turns into a nightmare not only for the hero but also for everyone associated with him. At the same time, it respects the audience's intelligence, gives us a great deal of information, trusts us to put it together and makes the intellectual analysis of the situation one of the movie's great pleasures."
No Way Out,7.1,35509515,90,"In thriller terms it's close to irresistible and enormously entertaining. And the movie's lack of weight is part of what makes it work, part of its gripping purity. What this movie, which as a political thriller has more in common with ""Three Days of the Condor"" or ""Seven Days in May"" than ""All the President's Men,"" has going for it is a great premise: the mainspring of this big clock is built to run."
No Way Out,7.1,35509515,90,"No Way Out's greatest prize is Costner, a leading man at last: fiercely good, intelligent, appreciatively sensual in a performance balanced perfectly between action and introspection. It's a movie that lends itself to more than one sitting, and when you go back, armed with full understanding, Costner's work seems even better than the first time, richer, more complex and many layered."
No Way Out,7.1,35509515,90,"Gripping...A very convincing nightmare, and if Hackman gives too rounded a performance to approach the omniscient evil of Laughton's original, Patton assumes the mantle as Brice's henchman, while Costner confirms his arrival as a star. Clearly, they can remake 'em like that any more."
No Way Out,7.1,35509515,80,Costner is extremely low key while Hackman glides through his role and Patton dominates his scenes overplaying his villainous hand. Young is extremely alluring as the heroine.
No Way Out,7.1,35509515,80,"This taut thriller adds so many twists of its own it might be more appropriately cross-referenced with The Manchurian Candidate, even though it isn't nearly as daffy or as mercurial."
No Way Out,7.1,35509515,75,"A worthy remake of the film noir classic THE BIG CLOCK, NO WAY OUT adds, among other things, a delightfully subversive twist ending. Good performances from a strong cast."
No Way Out,7.1,35509515,75,"No Way Out emerges, paradoxically, as a film that is better than it has to be and not as good as it ought to be, but there is skill here, as well as an admirable willingness to try something new."
No Way Out,7.1,35509515,75,"The action is tight and suspenseful, and the plot culminates in the most astounding last-minute switch of the decade. Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman shine as the main characters, and Will Patton leads a solid supporting cast."
No Way Out,7.1,35509515,75,"Indeed, viewers who arrive at the movie five minutes late and leave five minutes early will avoid the setup and payoff for the preposterous twist that spoils this lively, intelligent remake of 1948's The Big Clock."
The Gauntlet,6.4,35400000,75,"The Gauntlet is classic Clint Eastwood: fast, furious, and funny. It tells a cheerfully preposterous story with great energy and a lot of style, and nobody seems more at home in this sort of action movie than Eastwood."
The Gauntlet,6.4,35400000,70,"The well paced script is an effective mixture of worldliness and naïveté: despite the couple's graphic sparring scenes, in which Eastwood more than meets his match, their relationship remains curiously innocent; a kind of fugitive romanticism pervades."
The Gauntlet,6.4,35400000,70,"Vicious and hypocritical as it is, The Gauntlet remains an entertaining sort of disreputable show, considerably more proficient and interesting than junk melodramas in a dogged vein."
The Gauntlet,6.4,35400000,63,"It is a movie without a single thought in its head, but its action sequences are so ferociously staged that it's impossible not to pay attention most of the time."
The Gauntlet,6.4,35400000,63,"In a major role reversal, Clint Eastwood stars in The Gauntlet as a person who might be on the receiving end of the violence epitomized in his famed Dirty Harry film series."
The Gauntlet,6.4,35400000,60,"It's telling that the film is still only truly memorable for the closing five minute bulletfest, which turns Clint's bus into the only thing with more holes in it than the screenplay."
The Gauntlet,6.4,35400000,60,"The violence is bloody, nonstop, and as pointless as the script."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,80,A modernised Bond is dragged kicking and screaming into the 70s.
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,70,"There is a marvelous escape from an alligator farm (deadly reptiles are rather a motif in this movie), a superb collection of grotesque ways of killing, and a fine sense of pace and rhythm."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,70,"Live and Let Die isn't the best of the series by far, but it's not the worst either. The fun doesn't last due to the interference of the flimsy plot, centered around one of the least threatening Bond villains ever."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,63,"It has all the necessary girls, gimmicks, subterranean control rooms, uniformed goons and magic wristwatches it can hold, but it doesn't have the wit and it doesn't have the style of the best Bond movies."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,60,"The most significant Bond ingredient missing from Live and Let Die is Q, whose gadgets still play a central role. The film also offers a few key additions, including an illuminating glimpse of Bond’s home."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,60,"Two hours long and anti-climactic, but Bond fans won't be disappointed."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,50,"Watching Live and Let Die isn't a complete waste of time, but there's no overriding reason why anyone should go out of their way to see it unless they're a die-hard Bond fan or are curious about Roger Moore's first turn in the role."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,50,"This eighth film in the Bond series marks the first appearance of Roger Moore as the superspy. Less macho than Sean Connery's Bond, Moore's fastidiously dressed 007 survives by his wits and injects more humor into the proceedings."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,40,"Guy Hamilton's direction lacks enthusiasm and pace, while even the art direction—long the Bond films' real secret weapon—seems to have fallen to a shrunken budget. Not much fun."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,60,"If you can ignore the disturbing parallels with recent events, this middle-aged, Middle-American ""Attack The Block"" raises a laugh."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,60,"Some of the phallic jokes work, others are really lame. Fortunately there are many other funny bits that have nothing to do with body parts that keep the laughs coming."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,60,"As broad as a barn yet as thin as paper, The Watch is a summertime action-comedy that works almost in spite of its overcrowded cast and loose, pulpy spitball of a plot."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,55,"It's not that The Watch is terrible – it's not not terrible, but there are sufficient diversions and more punitive ways to spend your evening – but that it's one of those smoke bomb comedies that seems to disappear even while you're watching, leaving no trace of itself behind."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"Yes, it all gets kind of old, and yes, it's all over the place, but you'll probably find yourself laughing at least some of the time. Dick jokes, after all, can be pretty funny."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"The body part joke to alien joke ratio seems slightly skewed in favor of the former, which makes the humor more than a little repetitive. How many different ways can one film say: ""Men are idiots""?"
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"The Watch takes the same ethos of male bonding, obsession with sex and sardonic violence that has proved so profitable in recent years on yet another summer spin. The tires may be in need of changing pretty soon, but for now the jalopy still runs."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,The film is one long Costco joke - but the punch line is never all that funny.
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"The end result is mediocre, slightly sloppy and a mild waste of a great cast."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"Reality aside, The Watch is harmless enough - and even occasionally humorous, in a riffy, sketch-comedy kind of way."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"What's onscreen feels as half-assed and juvenile as it was probably always envisioned to be, suggesting an umpteenth retelling of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" by way of ""The Hangover,"" or perhaps a far less inspired version of ""Attack the Block"" transplanted to small-town Ohio."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"It should be funnier. It should be better. Instead, it just sort of is."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,It sticks in the craw. The whole movie does.
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"If this movie wanders into your neighborhood, the only watch that will hold your attention is the timepiece on your wrist."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"In spite of some prominently featured green slime and power-beam weaponry, it won't make anyone forget ""Ghostbusters"" anytime soon."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"It's so determined to be crude, vulgar and offensive that after a while I grew weary. Abbott and Costello used to knock out funnier movies on this exact intellectual plane without using a single F, S, C, P or A word."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,42,"Certainly possesses a lot of energy, but it's never harnessed or focused effectively. As a buddy comedy, all four leads have done better, and you already know what those movies are, and this one doesn't stand among them."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,42,"If this amateur justice league spent as much time analyzing clues as they did analyzing their junk, in every slang variation available in the Urban Dictionary, the murder mystery in The Watch could have been solved on the first night of surveillance."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,40,"Lacking the bite of ""Attack The Block,"" Stiller and co. are happy to fall back on their usual shtick, with director Schaffer providing barely enough juice to power the laughs."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,40,"There's a secret weapon embedded within The Watch, however, and his name is Richard Ayoade."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,40,"The Watch perks up when Ayoade's spacey line readings give it something unique and unexpected - otherwise, per Costco, audiences are buying their generic sci-fi comedy in bulk."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,40,The movie builds to a human-versus-alien showdown so sloppily staged that it makes little visual sense. The bargain-basement pyrotechnics suggest that much of The Watch was filmed on autopilot on a strict budget.
The Watch,5.7,35353000,40,Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn play the guys they always play in this sci-fi comedy misfire.
The Watch,5.7,35353000,40,"The Watch is awfully lightweight, and while it earns its R rating via some comic gore and a whole lot of hyper-sexualized tomfoolery, it's hardly the best work of anyone involved."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,40,"You're unlikely to laugh much, and you may get an unexpected case of the non-art-imitates-bad-life creeps."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,38,"Then there's the movie itself, which should be crazy, stupid fun but settles for just stupid."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,38,The Watch is a studio turd marinated in eau de skunk that stinks worse than week-old fish.
The Watch,5.7,35353000,38,"It's another one of those loud, penis-obsessed bro farces, lazily written (by actor Seth Rogen, among others) and haphazardly directed."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,38,"What's perhaps most off-putting about the movie isn't its increasingly stale humor, but the way it ultimately validates its characters' worst impulses."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,25,"It's a mash-up of blah buddy comedy and gross-out CGI monster splatter, with nary a laugh to be had."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,25,It's a dumb-ass comedy done strictly for a seriously large paycheque.
The Watch,5.7,35353000,25,The danger of dreaming up a predictable adventure for a group of nobodies you hold in contempt is that the audience will see your indifference and raise you.
The Watch,5.7,35353000,25,"As far as formulaic, empty and disappointing comedies go, The Watch is far from the worst. About every seven or eight minutes, perhaps a dozen times over the course of the picture, the movie generates a medium-size laugh. Not a big laugh."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,0,"This messy mix of sci-fi horror and post-Superbad raunchiness didn't make me laugh once. Not a single snicker, chortle or smile."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,0,"Every summer needs a super-turkey. So barring anything in the next 30 days that's the second coming of ""Howard the Duck,"" the witless, completely terrible ""comedy"" now called The Watch should win hands-down."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,67,"It's not exactly thrilling, and it doesn't cover much new ground. But young audiences will lap it up like ice cream."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,60,An enjoyable escapade and a great introduction to the forthcoming series - just not the seventh Star Wars film fans were hoping for.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,58,"With its simple-goal-driven plot, its wordy, cutscene-like interludes, and its stiffly modeled characters, it wouldn't even make for a particularly high-end videogame."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,"The largely uninspired Clone Wars feels landlocked. In the absence of any extensive innovation, the video game-ready results play more like a feature-length promo for the imminent TV series of the same name than a stand-alone event."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,This isn't the Star Wars we've always known and at least sometimes loved.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,"When George Lucas last pulled off an original idea for a feature film, Bill Clinton was still thought of by many voters as overweight and chaste."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,The best that can be said about the movie is that it's harmless and mostly charmless. The Clone Wars is to Star Wars what karaoke is to pop music.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,The Clone Wars is the last nail in a coffin that has been propped up ever since George Lucas sold his creative soul in the quest for a few more pieces of gold.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,"Looks fantastic, but the film suffers from the TV-to-feature transition."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,Gets more cluttered and confused as it moves along.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,"Lucas' films are like Cher's face. No matter how many times you rework the same material, it's never going to be new and fresh again. And so it is with his latest, Star Wars: The Clone Wars."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,Essentially an extended trailer for the 2008 Cartoon Network animated series.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,"As a mechanical thrill ride, The Clone Wars has an uncluttered look and furious pace that make it more or less as satisfying as its wildly overdesigned predecessors."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,"Once again, even reasonably committed fans will need a scorecard to keep track of who's fighting whom. What's the real target audience - i.e. kids - supposed to make of it all?"
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,42,"It might be impressive as a made-for-DVD production, but coming from producer George Lucas, it makes for a cheap excuse for a big-screen spectacle."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,42,"Unlike its predecessors, this one doesn't even try to aspire to myth. It aspires only to merchandising."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,40,"The Clone Wars is minor to the point of irrelevance, nothing more than a stylized direct-to-DVD shrug projected onto a big screen while Lucas launches two more TV series filling in prequel blanks better left empty."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,40,"Despite some absolutely gorgeous animation and adjusting expectations for what Clone Wars is meant to be, the Force is not strong with this one."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,38,Don't expect the seventh Star Wars film here. Star Wars: The Clone Wars is more like a long Saturday morning cartoon.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,38,Basically just a 98-minute trailer for the autumn launch of a new series on the Cartoon Network.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,38,"While the movie and the accompanying series are being pitched to a younger audience than most new Star Wars ventures, parents may be perturbed by the film's relentless violence."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,33,"The animated characters in ""Clone Wars"" are about as lively as the actors in the live-action movies, so I guess Lucas has achieved his goal of eliminating humans from his movies altogether."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,30,Unfolds with all the entertainment value of watching somebody else play a video game.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,30,"Clone Wars will appeal only to the most tolerant, galactically minded children and their parents."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,30,"The whole thing feels like a continuation of Lucas' experiments to see how much sh-- his dwindling supporters will take before finally saying ""enough"" and moving on to adult pursuits."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,25,At what point might animators be arrested for doing work so ugly it causes aesthetic blindness in millions of younglings?
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,20,The latest indignity.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,20,Story is entirely insignificant in The Clone Wars.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,20,"Without the grandiose narrative structure of the six live-action releases, this feels even more pointless, a mechanical attempt to milk the kids for every last dime."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,0,George Lucas is turning into the enemy of fun.
Commando,6.7,35100000,70,"In Commando, the fetching surprise is the glancing humor between the quixotic and larky Rae Dawn Chong and the straight-faced killing machine of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Chong lights up the film like a firefly, Schwarzenegger delivers a certain light touch of his own, the result is palatable action comics."
Commando,6.7,35100000,63,"Though not as good as Terminator, the film has a better-than-usual script for this sort of thing and shows a lot of humor. Schwarzenegger isn't especially good as an actor, but his presence is impressive, and he is beginning to show some style, if not much substance. For action fans, one of the picks of the litter for the year."
Commando,6.7,35100000,63,"Comic book stuff, helped out by the presence of Rae Dawn Chong as an airline stewardess whose sarcastic commentary adds some comic counterpoint to the deliberately overscaled action."
Commando,6.7,35100000,60,Two-thirds of this 90-minute film is mayhem unrelieved by humor and untouched by humanity.
Commando,6.7,35100000,50,"Lots of machine-gunfire, explosions and disposable khaki-clad extras, as you'd expect."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,100,"An expensive flop and the latest Iraq movie to be shunned by the mass audience, Green Zone was still the year's most visceral, thrilling entertainment."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,100,"It is a thriller, not a documentary. It's my belief that the nature of the neocon evildoing has by now become pretty clear. Others will disagree. The bottom line is: This is one hell of a thriller."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,88,Damon's prior appearances as Jason Bourne make him credible in this role.
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,80,"When Mr. Greengrass made ""United 93,"" his 2006 reconstruction of one of the Sept. 11 hijackings, some people fretted that it was too soon. My own response to Green Zone is almost exactly the opposite: it's about time."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,80,"Made with daring and passion, it attempts the impossible and comes remarkably close to pulling it off. So close, in fact, that the skill and audacity used, the shock and awe of this highly entertaining attempt, are more significant than the imperfect results."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,80,"Christopher Rouse's rapid-fire editing nervously stitches the stunts, chases, fights and confrontations together. It's a remarkable film."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,80,"Bourne goes epic. A wham-bam actioner, but its pointed political subtext ensures Damon and Greengrass deliver their most provocative mission yet."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,80,"A master of smash-mash montage and choreographed chaos, Greengrass is the best action director working today, adroit at producing the sense of everyone converging and everything happening simultaneously."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,80,"The cast is strong, and Damon is a dependable center for all this, a classic American good guy wanting to know what's rotten and why."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,78,"No matter where your political gullibilities lie, Green Zone is a riveting piece of actioneering."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,75,Watchable in spite of Greengrass as much as because of him. The story is good enough to make viewers want to ignore the photography.
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,75,Mixes fact and speculation in a way that's already raised the ire of some on the right as well as on the left.
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,75,"Green Zone can't make up its mind whether it's ""The Bourne Insurrection"" or ""Hurt Locker: The Prequel."""
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,75,"It's at times implausible and heavy-handed, but thrillers need villains and it's not like the Ba'ath Party had an exclusive license on 'em."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,70,"This is a movie that recognizes there's no straight line to the truth, which is part of what makes it vaguely unsatisfying -- though it's also what keeps it honest."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,70,To pretend that the film doesn't make a political statement is silly. Of course it does. It wouldn't be effective at all if it didn't.
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,67,"Indeed, Green Zone plays a little bit like a video game version of the Oscar-winning film (The Hurt Locker)-- which should tell you right off whether it's for you or not."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,67,"For the first time in Greengrass' career, the politics too often get ahead of the action, so points that might have been subtly embedded in the story are instead laid out like a left-wing editorial."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,63,"Miller's wake-up call is meant to be ours. Too little and too late? Maybe. But even in this Bourne Zone, Damon and Greengrass haven't shirked their duty to enlighten and entertain."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,63,"The jittery, scattershot camerawork of Greengrass's longtime cinematographer, Barry Ackroyd, was used far more coherently in Kathryn Bigelow's Oscar-winning ""The Hurt Locker,"" and the constant blurry close-ups of computer screens and street-level scrums lose their power with each successive cut."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,63,"Zone feels anticlimactic now. It also pales in comparison to Oscar-winning ""The Hurt Locker,"" the most powerful film yet made about the Iraq war."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,63,"Partly real and partly, increasingly, fantastic and outlandish in its wishful thinking."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,63,Green Zone is just an excuse for director Paul Greengrass to haul out his jittery hand-held camera as Miller and Co. sprint through the streets and buildings of Baghdad in pursuit of one villain or another.
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,63,Green Zone is somewhere between a blockbuster and a tract -- a traction movie. It whizzes and bangs and sizzles as it chases the truth like a dog off its leash.
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,63,"In the wake of the Oscar-winning ""The Hurt Locker"" - a far better film, and one with a less strident, less obvious agenda - Green Zone arrives looking strangely anachronistic."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,58,Green Zone wraps up with a wish-fulfillment fantasy that is about as believable as watching reinforcements riding in to save Custer.
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,58,"With Green Zone, though, the malaise has finally hit me. So while Damon's Miller uncovers the (inconvenient) truth of why the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, all I want to know is: How does he suggest we get out?"
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,50,"To suggest that a lone, brave soldier could have set things right with a little amateur sleuthing seems like cinematic wish-fulfillment, an insult both to the intelligence of viewers and to the troops."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,50,"Screenwriter Brian Helgeland (L.A. Confidential, Mystic River) is the real culprit here, creating a crude paint-by-numbers fiction that keeps yelling about the importance of the truth while hurtling in the opposite direction."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,50,"Director Paul Greengrass has applied his jumpy, tumbling visual style to action blockbusters with Matt Damon and serious dramatizations of political events. This Iraq war drama makes a game attempt to meld the two, though manufacturing thrills takes precedence over any kind of journalistic insight."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,50,"Once Damon's one-man truth squad goes off the reservation and starts behaving too much like Jason Bourne for comfort, the film begins not only spilling more blood but also leaking crucial credibility."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,50,"Shot by Barry Ackroyd, the same cinematographer who filmed ""The Hurt Locker,"" and using the same camera techniques, this movie looks like outtakes from a much better film."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,50,Green Zone isn't so much a bad movie as a misguided one.
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,40,"For a while Green Zone generates genuine excitement, as well as plenty of provocation--a fatuous surrogate for Ahmed Chalabi, a pervasive scorn for American planning--but then goes off its own reservation into a won't-fly zone of awkward preachments and hapless absurdities."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,40,Green Zone is an exercise in commercial cowardice masquerading as a thriller about political bravery.
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,40,"It's also rather tawdry. The climax is as ludicrous as any Jack Bauer adventure, and Greengrass is always on shaky ground. Literally."
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,40,What lends the film its grip and its haste is also what makes it unsatisfactory.
Green Zone,6.8,35053660,40,"Not since a Nam-scarred Sly Stallone asked, ""Do we get to win this time?"" in ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" has an American action star been deployed to rewrite history so thoroughly."
Red Heat,6.1,34994648,75,"The film is punctuated by violence, a great deal of violence, although most of it is exaggerated comic-book style instead of being truly gruesome. Walking that fine line is a speciality of Hill, who once simulated the sound of a fist on a chin by making tape recordings of Ping-Pong paddles slapping leather sofas."
Red Heat,6.1,34994648,75,"Hill has gotten Schwarzenegger to give one of the best performances of his career, and Belushi too is thoroughly convincing as an action hero. RED HEAT is a welcome break from the shallow shoot-'em-ups that became the standard in the 1980s."
Red Heat,6.1,34994648,75,"Schwarzenegger, who when he dons a green suit is dubbed 'Gumby' by Belushi, is right on target with his characterization of the iron-willed soldier, and Belushi proves a quicksilver foil."
Red Heat,6.1,34994648,75,"Thanks to a fairly good script, this thriller about a Soviet cop sent to Chicago to apprehend a Soviet drug dealer is a respectable enough star vehicle."
Red Heat,6.1,34994648,70,"Red Heat is a topically entertaining variation on the sort of action-adventure nonsense that plays best on television. Mr. Hill's touch is heavy when he takes himself seriously. However, he has a real gift for instantly disposable fantasy."
Red Heat,6.1,34994648,70,"Red Heat is poorly, or even indifferently, made. It's a joyless exercise, and too much angry resignation seeps in for it to be very funny or very entertaining."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,90,"The James Bond production team has found its second wind with Licence to Kill, a cocktail of high-octane action, spectacle and drama...The thrills-and-spills chases are superbly orchestrated as pic spins at breakneck speed through its South Florida and Central American locations."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,88,"On the basis of this second performance as Bond, Dalton can have the role as long as he enjoys it. He makes an effective Bond - lacking Sean Connery's grace and humor, and Roger Moore's suave self-mockery, but with a lean tension and a toughness that is possibly more contemporary."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,88,"If Licence to Kill has one of Bond`s best heavies, it also has one of his best heroines in Carey Lowell, a strapping brunet who plays an ex-Army pilot reluctantly enrolled on Bond`s side. Lowell`s line readings may be only adequate, but she moves with the grace and vigor an action movie needs."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,80,"The series has been with us since 1962 and, like many another old timer, tends to repeat itself. Yet, every once in a while, it pulls in its stomach, pops the gun from its cummerbund, arches its eyebrow and gets off another bull's-eye. The newest, Licence to Kill, is probably one of the five or six best of Bond."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,75,"Not since Dr. No has 007 been so cool and ruthless, and never has a plot been this close to realistic plausibility."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,75,"One of the best of the 16 Bond films, thanks to Dalton's athletic, tough and deadly new 007."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,70,"If Licence to Kill added more than just scenes with Q to lighten the load, if it provided a love interest as compelling as Vesper and more engaging than Lowell's whiny Pam Bouvier, this Bond could have been one of the instant greats, instead of one that is better appreciated with age. The movie is not perfect, but a lot of what works now in the series got its start in Dalton's last mission as James Bond."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,70,"Despite some shaky narrative continuity and muddled motivations, this manages to move pretty briskly, and the action sequences are generally well handled, especially at the climax."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,70,Licence to Kill continues the salvage operation begun in The Living Daylights and rescues a series that was in danger of shooting itself in the foot.
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,63,"But this cruise is also a gruesome one. You may find yourself shaken -- not stirred -- by the screenwriting cruelty and cynicism behind the 16th ""Bond."""
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,63,"As unlikely as it seems, Mr. Dalton actually appears to be growing in the Bond role, which is potentially stifling because its own popularity has so rigidly defined it."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,63,"Not as witty as The Living Daylights, but it doesn't let the audience down in the arena of effects, gadgetry, and locations."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,63,"For all its clever updatings, stylish action and witty escapism, Licence to Kill is still a little too much by the book. Mr. Dalton is perfectly at home as an angry Bond, and as a romantic lead and as an action hero, but he never seems to blend any two of those qualities at once."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,60,"Hardcore Bond fans may be dismayed by some of the changes, but no one can deny that the action scenes staged by director John Glen are some of the most spectacular of the entire series and well worth the price of admission."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,58,"Like ""The Living Daylights"", Licence to Kill definitely has its moments. But also like ""The Living Daylights"", the new, two-hour-plus picture goes on too long and is encumbered by a needlessly complicated plot."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,50,"He may look the part, but Timothy Dalton fails the boots, the scuba gear, or the automobiles left him by Moore and Connery."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,50,"Drab in the extreme. Timothy Dalton's second and wheezing, final turn as 007 was barely recognizable as a Bond film."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,50,"It's time to find a new Bond. This one is tuckered out, spent, his signature tuxedo in sore need of pressing...Dalton plays a straight-faced, humorless, no-nonsense Bond -- all guns and no play -- and it makes for a very dull time."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,50,"The Bond women are pallid mannequins, and so is the misused Dalton -- a moving target in a Savile Row suit. For every plausible reason, he looks as bored in his second Bond film as Sean Connery did in his sixth."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,80,"Made with energetic flair and no small dose of violence, mercifully handled with discretion, Hostage exemplifies taut, confident filmmaking."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,75,"My new theory is that Willis' own aesthetic soul is more old-world than he knows, and that he works best with directors who either are (Luc Besson) or might as well be (M. Night Shyamalan) European."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,75,Hostage has suspense and momentum.
Hostage,6.6,34639939,75,"The mechanics of the final showdown are unexpected and yet show an undeniable logic, and are sold by the acting skills of Willis and Pollak."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,70,"If Hostage looks a lot like a state-of-the-art French ""policier"" minus the pesky subtitles, the effect is purely intentional."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,70,"The movie isn't particularly tasteful or finely crafted -- but it grabs you by the jugular, and only during an overcooked climax does it finally relax its grip."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,67,"Full of small, weird moments."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,63,"Willis, who'll turn 50 a week from Saturday, has this kind of hero down pat. He may never again get or demand the complicated dramatic roles I think he could handle, but he's well-cast."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,63,"Hostage is really about sleek Bruce - buff, bald and clean-shaven - as he goes to town on two sets of assailants."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,63,"On the plus side, bloated narratives make for a busy action star, and Bruce is quite the workaholic on this outing, clearly eager to rekindle memories of his ""Die Hard"" glory days."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,63,"Right from the intriguing opening sequence, which hints at the bleakness which envelops the movie, Willis’ Talley is an interesting character."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,60,What sends this initially tense thriller over the precipice is a plot scheme that never knows when enough is enough.
Hostage,6.6,34639939,60,Brainlessly efficient action thriller.
Hostage,6.6,34639939,60,"Certainly delivers violence and heroics, but not in a way everyone is going to enjoy -- it's brutal and harrowing."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,60,"There's a gripping thriller between the gaps in logic. Director Florent Siri has a tough style and an unforgiving attitude, but it drowns in the queasy blood lust."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,58,"The action is dynamically filmed and Willis is at his best. Suspense is soon hijacked by outright gore and grisliness, though."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,50,"From the first strains of its overly dramatic, self-important score -- come on, this is not by any stretch of the imagination ""Citizen Kane."""
Hostage,6.6,34639939,50,Especially discomfiting is the stream of kids in peril.
Hostage,6.6,34639939,50,"It's a B-flick all the way, but it has no pretensions to the contrary, and that's some kind of refreshing."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,50,"By the time the film escalates into a suitably ridiculous Grand Guignol finale, all connection to reality has been severed."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,50,"Bruce looks hot and underplays handsomely as always, but Hostage is a steaming pile of siege clichés and screaming unlikelihoods."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,40,"The amazing thing is how dull a movie crawling with gunfire, psycho tantrums and stuff blowing up can be when you just don't care what happens to anyone."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,40,"Director Siri has a stylish eye that makes this film resemble a film noir outing, but the script (by Doug Richardson) is at first routine before growing increasingly outlandish."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,40,"Beyond the cliches, there's something deeply offensive about the way Hostage exploits our empathy for children in peril."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,38,An unrelenting assault on the brain and eardrums.
Hostage,6.6,34639939,38,It doesn't satisfy in the way a good thriller ought to.
Hostage,6.6,34639939,30,"But by the time Willis's character saves this considerably long day, it's filmgoers who will no doubt feel like prisoners, as a movie that promises to be a taut nail-biter devolves into the kind of silly, overblown climax parodied so beautifully by Robert Altman in ""The Player."""
Hostage,6.6,34639939,30,"Take a tired formula...Stir with a director, Florent Siri, who has no shame about stealing every sadistic suspense trick from the Die Hard series. Serve to a gullible audience willing to pay top dollar for secondhand goods."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,30,Hostage may well be the first action flick cited both for child abuse and audience abuse. In a singularly sadistic and degrading way it has something to offend everyone.
Hostage,6.6,34639939,25,"This is a half-hearted, derivative action film with not a single honest artistic impulse behind it."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,25,"More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on Hostage, a pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Bruce Willis's fading career as an action hero."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,80,The delight of this awesome thriller is simply that Schwarzenegger--an old hand at this sort of running-around-shooting-henchmen thing--could easily sleepwalk through the movie...but he doesn't.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,75,"Spottiswoode and Schwarzenegger deliver a clever and colorful conspiratorial thriller with high-energy action scenes, car crashes a go-go, spectacular technology and big explosions, packaged with ferocious glee and spoofing humor. Who could ask for more from Ah-nold?"
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,75,This movie knows how to entertain.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,75,A well-crafted entertainment containing enough ideas to qualify it as science fiction and not just as a futurist thriller.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,75,Well worth the price of admission.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,75,"A fun ride. It's loud and obvious, but it's also the first high-tech, sci-fi thriller to think through some of the implications of cloning and capitalism."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,70,A clever but routine science fiction flick.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,70,"A bit of a clone itself, but it's got a crackerjack helicopter chase, a semblance of a script, and a sotto voce performance by Robert Duvall as a biotech genius who murmurs sweet nothings to his dying cloned wife."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,70,"Offers high-speed helicopter chases, fireballing explosions, deadly laser guns, futuristic technology gone amok, multiple car crashes, two Arnold Schwarzeneggers for the price of one - almost everything except a plot that makes sense."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,67,"The movie isn't ""Blade Runner,"" but it's got some provocative ideas about the implications of cloning in a market-driven, capitalist society."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,63,A mostly standard-issue latter-day Arnold Schwarzenegger actioner spiked with a creepily plausible cloning angle.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,63,Plays like something picked up at a vintage store; you can see all the greasy fingerprints from those who have handled it before.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,63,"This movie is a clone itself, a far cry from ""Total Recall"" but vastly superior to ""End of Days."""
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,63,"Like Schwarzenegger himself, it looks tired, and a little bored."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,60,"Edited like the world's most expensive car ad. The screen opens and closes like a nervous accordion, and the action shifts speeds like crazy."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,60,"From its standard-issue action to its halfhearted dialogue and acting, that's one situation even two Schwarzeneggers aren't enough to solve."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,50,Offers director Roger Spottiswoode a chance to have the worst actor in Beverly Hills play scenes with himself.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,50,Achieves a level of hypocrisy astounding less for its brazenness than for its sheer stupidity.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,50,It's mediocrity at its most unremarkable.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,50,Neither smart nor exciting enough to justify the effort.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,50,Another droning formulaic thriller.
Inferno,6.2,34343574,75,"It is a satisfying but thoroughly idiotic film, in which relationships make no sense, character motivations change on a dime, and Tom Hanks has weird hair. But brainless as it is, it’s artful. It is a well-made bit of silliness, a piece of construction optimally designed to maintain audience interest while garnering absolutely no one’s respect."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,75,Inferno delivers as an engaging thriller that I frankly enjoyed far more than Howard’s last Brown outing.
Inferno,6.2,34343574,75,"Bourne it is not, but the twists come with enough regularity to keep the squishier parts of the plot from mucking up the works."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,70,"It's fair to say that Inferno won't be for everyone, but those who have stuck through Howard and Hanks' previous Dan Brown adaptations should find enough thrills to keep them interested in solving the mystery."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,70,"Koepp has managed a brisk adaptation, although some of the dialogue can feel very forced, particularly when it comes to the clue-solving set-ups. Still, Howard keeps the viewer constantly occupied, Felicity Jones is an engaging sidekick, and there’s clearly a lot more mileage left for Tom Hanks in this franchise’s tank."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,70,"Although some of the film’s many twists are not that surprising, they’re satisfyingly delivered, and with a strong supporting cast ...plus striking dream imagery, this adds up to arguably the best in the franchise so far."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,67,Returning director Ron Howard somewhat belabors the Botticelli-inspired hallucinations Langdon suffers from following a konk on the head – though you really can’t oversell the creepiness of a beaky plague mask – but he continues to have an inspired hand in casting his supporting players.
Inferno,6.2,34343574,63,"Perhaps Howard’s dutiful obligation to Brown’s treasure-hunt oeuvre will end here, with the temperate Inferno sparking a resurgence to follow. Dante wrote that “The poets leave hell and again behold the stars.” Here’s hoping that Howard has some shine left in him."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,63,"Inferno is the exact cinematic equivalent of an airport paperback, which is what’s fine and forgettable about it."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,60,Early promise proves misleading in a sequel that should be far better than The Da Vinci Code than it actually is.
Inferno,6.2,34343574,58,"This latest film, which was made on about half the budget of either of its predecessors, is as close as the Langdon-Howard cycle has gotten to actually being fun."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,58,"The first two — The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons — left much to be desired. This one emerges as a marked improvement, though that’s not saying a whole lot."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"Whatever inspired the compulsively addictive (I assume) fast-selling book series isn’t found in yet another dull, tiresome race-against-the-clock European mystery thriller with a historical twist."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"The most interesting character and performance come from the great Indian actor Iffran Khan (“Life of Pi,” “Jurassic World,” “The Lunchbox”). He brings a wonderful world weariness to this “dark money” criminal mastermind."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"Unless you are a Dante scholar, and perhaps not even then, following Inferno is a wild goose chase – without the goose."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"Part of the draw of these movies is that they don’t create beauty, but instead borrow the emotions of the beauty they depict. (This, more or less, is one definition of kitsch, courtesy of the philosopher Tomas Kulka.) That makes the movies easy to watch and easy to forget."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"The film is never gripping, but at least it moves. Director Ron Howard does his best to spark excitement with cheesy horror-movie editing — brief shots of the damnation in store if the virus is unleashed — and there are a couple of twists to keep things lively. Nothing is what it seems, unless it seems ridiculous, in which case it’s exactly what it seems."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"The ""Da Vinci Code"" was adequate but forgettable. ""Angels & Demons"" was godawful. Inferno is somewhere in between - watchable but by no means worth the money and effort necessary to see it theatrically."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,Don’t get burned by Inferno.
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"It's not that ""Inferno"" as it stands doesn't provide hints of better things. The plot has its share of unexpected twists, peripheral characters hold our attention, wide-screen vistas of tourist destinations Florence, Venice and Istanbul are easy to take, and stories involving the end of the world have a certain built-in interest. But as presented on screen, none of this gels as it should."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"Inferno is another docent tour dressed as an action movie, a baby boomer's fantasy of travel and intrigue."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"The multiple twists, double-crosses and leaps in logic are more likely to prompt giggles than gasps, despite the impressive production values and the earnest efforts of an A-list cast."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"Ron Howard, who’s tied to this franchise like a man trapped in a decaying house by a huge mortgage, tries without success to blow life into David Koepp’s script."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"The chase, chase, chase pace is tiring, not least because it’s not clear who many of these people are and what agendas they’re following. Mixed-up confusion is the result."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"Even with a wealth of talent involved, Inferno is missing some serious heat."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,42,"When it was all over, I found myself googling Dante for my own clue as to what I’d just suffered: “He who knows most grieves most for wasted time.”"
Inferno,6.2,34343574,42,"Inferno, much like its predecessors, simply can’t work its way out of the disappointing middle ground between a slick, technically competent thriller and tongue-in-cheek absurdity."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,42,"If the first film was ploddingly, airlessly faithful to its source, this follows the second in being frantically paced, chaotic and increasingly exasperating."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,40,"Tom Hanks takes his art down a peg with another paycheck performance as the dramatic cipher Robert Langdon in Inferno, Ron Howard’s mostly lame adaptation of Dan Brown’s wholly lame novel."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,40,"This gets to be exhausting, since there’s hardly a scene that isn’t manipulative or assaultive."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,40,"Inferno feels every bit like the second sequel in an exhausted franchise, stunted by unfocused storytelling and a blandness that's almost sleep-inducing."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,40,"Inferno...is the kind of movie that stops — and stoops — to explain, early and often. Not that the explanations amount to much; the movie makes almost no sense."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,40,"Howard's film, particularly early on, ends up being too fast, too dense and too smart for its own good. Keeping moviegoers guessing is one thing. Keeping them confused is quite another."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,40,"It’s not the worst of the trilogy, but this is less for fans of thrillers and more for people who are pining after last year’s holiday to Florence."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,40,"By the end, even Hanks looks a bit bored."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,40,"There’s a stern, let’s-get-to-work air to the film’s craft and conception that hampers whatever thrill of the chase “Inferno” has to offer. Fundamentally silly the film may be, but it never graduates to spryness."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,38,"Hanks is one of the most likable actors on the planet. But Inferno just lays there onscreen, pancake-flat and with no animating spark to make us give a damn."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,38,"The more movie magic Howard piles on, the less we care. And, boy, does he pull out all the stops, stocking the pic with a tub of red herrings, half a dozen plot twists, and more complex set pieces than a comic-book flick. I felt relieved when it was finally over."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,38,This is a franchise with lead weights tied around its ankles.
Inferno,6.2,34343574,37,"Say what you will about Dan Brown’s books. They may be, as some have noted, poorly written, formulaic and pretentious. But at least they hold a reader’s attention, in ways that this excursion — as sleep-inducing and rigidly predictable as a train ride — does not."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,30,"The Da Vinci Code wasn’t Da Vinci, but it was an actual movie with texture and characters. Inferno is dumbed down to a shocking degree."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,25,It's impossible to even laugh at Inferno given how Ron Howard reduces the material to a dull spectacle of earnest puzzle-solving.
Inferno,6.2,34343574,20,"Like The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons before it, Inferno stumbles into the same pitfalls of convoluted plotting, kindergarten art history and conspiracy theories of the daytime-slot-on-the-Discovery-Channel sort."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,20,"While the plot’s endless lurches and jinks are designed to hold you in a constant state of pleasurable bafflement, the cumulative effect is desensitisation: no single thread holds long enough to give you anything to cheer for or believe in."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,20,"Ron Howard allows all manner of contrivances to pile up in David Koepp‘s screenplay, as if relying on constant reference to Dante’s Divine Comedy would make people think, “Ooh, this is clever stuff.”"
Inferno,6.2,34343574,20,"Once upon a time, this wackiness had some novelty value. Now it’s tedious."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,10,Take the Dan Brown out of a Dan Brown movie and all you’re left with is Tom Hanks jogging in mild irritation.
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,90,Snakes was the most exuberantly trashy delight of this summer movie season or last.
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,88,A movie called Snakes on a Plane had better be one of two things: So bad it's good or so good it's great. Darned if it isn't a little bit of both.
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,88,"Why is this movie so watchable? Four simple reasons. It's truly funny. It's truly scary. It's truly gruesome. And Samuel L. Jackson is the cool head who prevails (“You stick with me, you live”)."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,75,"The film failed to be frightening, suspenseful or dramatic but accidentally succeeded in being absolutely hilarious."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,75,"Looming large over all this is Jackson, who glowers and growls and acts the hero better than any actor out there."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,75,"If you can find a better time at the movies this year than this wild comic thriller, let me in on it."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,75,"Hilariously funny, full of fang-popping scares, and guaranteed to increase travel by train."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,70,"This is a coolly efficient, tongue-in-cheek horror-comedy."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,70,"What they give us is the chance to win, not with righteous morality, but with an old-fashioned swagger that says, much like the film itself, Hey, we may be stupid, but we rock."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,70,"Who knows whether Snakes will have--forgive me--legs, but it's more than awesome enough to assure opening-weekend euphoria."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,70,There's something almost refreshingly venal about a movie with no purpose other than to meet intentions this cheesy.
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,67,"To be sure, Snakes on a Plane is going to inspire some highly readable graduate-school film theses. You may even want to re-enroll to pen one yourself."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,63,"Cheesy, campy B-movie fun, thanks mostly to the cadre of cobras and their ilk and also to Jackson (probably the only actor alive who could pull off this save-the-day bad ass movie role)."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,63,"To an extent, Snakes on a Plane reminds me of ""Eight Legged Freaks."" It has the same kind of off-the-wall, don't-take-it-seriously comedic horror sensibility."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,63,"There is also a capable, wisecracking stewardess (Julianna Margulies) and, what a surprise, a steward who appears to be doing a Paul Lynde impersonation."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,60,"1. It has the potential to supplant ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" as the greatest audience participation movie of all time.
2. It is, simultaneously, one of the worst and best movies I’ve ever seen."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,60,"Snakes on a Plane is exactly the sort of tasteless, utterly depraved, no-nonsense sluts-and-guts extravaganza it was meant to be."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,60,"While Snakes on a Plane barely stands up as a movie, it definitely qualifies as an event."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,60,It’s the sort of picture you'll either queue all night in the rain to see twelve times or avoid like a Wayans Brothers Retrospective for the rest of life.
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,58,"More potent than anything in Snakes on a Plane is the fantasy offscreen: that if enough people talk up their desire to see this film and, at the same time, take an overt delight in what an unabashed piece of junk it is, they will fuse with the hype, with the movie's mystique. They will not just watch Snakes on a Plane; they will own it."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,50,"This hotly anticipated film delivers on the premise of its celebrated title. But it offers little more in terms of suspense, originality or enjoyment. Mostly, it lays there on the screen like a big lazy boa."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,50,"Snakes on a Plane represents a fairly craven mixture of deliberate cheese and inadvertent lameness, plus fangs."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,50,"The result is not quite a horror movie (too cheerful and can-do) or a thriller (too cheerful and stupid), nor does it parody itself or take itself seriously, thereby canceling out the camp factor. It's more like an improv sketch at 30,000 feet."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,50,"Nothing at all special. It's one more cheesy, broadly played, poorly paced, instantly forgettable August action movie."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,50,The whole enterprise has the sweaty sheen that comes from trying too hard to be cool.
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,50,"The movie's highest level of artistic expression was the ingenious Internet campaign that catapulted it to culture phenom months before it even opened. The thing itself turns out to be pretty much an afterthought, cheesy and not very well worked out."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,50,"The plot is ridiculous and the characters are cardboard, but none of that really matters once the snakes get into the cabin and start zapping people, the very definition of entertainment."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,50,"The audience decided to sell Snakes to itself, and that became the event--the actual movie could never have been more than another exploitation picture."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,38,"Neither as good nor as bad as you'd hoped it would be: It's just a mediocre exploitation picture with an inspired premise (succinctly spelled out by its title), loads of gratuitous gore, a dash of equally gratuitous nudity and enough inanities to make you wonder if Ed Wood rose from the grave to serve as a creative consultant on the project."
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,38,It's not so bad that it's good. It's so bland that it's boring. Not even worth a hissss.
Snakes on a Plane,5.5,34020814,25,Not since Pet Rocks riveted the nation have so many gotten so excited over so little.
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,75,"Death Wish is easily the second best “Death Wish” movie ever made, and not a distant second."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,Death Wish is a classier version of what you can find on cable in the wee hours — it’s not worth seeing in the theater — but it’s worth pausing over its politics of guns.
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,"The one light at the end of this long, slogged-through tunnel is, surprisingly, Willis."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,"The 2018 Death Wish has been developed with a specific audience in mind – those who enjoy these kinds of thoughtlessly violent outings. The direction is workmanlike, although without the flourishes that have added some visual razzle-dazzle to similar orgies of brutality like ""John Wick"" and its sequel."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,"The film, much like Willis' performance, never flatlines, but it never delivers the thrills you expect from this type of genre piece."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,"Again and again, Death Wish feels anything but real."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,"Roth and Carnahan’s motivations here remain murky and Death Wish never justifies its existence. Divorced of context, it’s like sauce and tomato without the burger."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,"The film’s best stability through all of these shifts is Willis who, while he could do a role like this in his sleep (and has), commands the screen and reminds us why he became an above-the-marquee star in the first place."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,Eli Roth’s Death Wish isn’t a bad movie as far as super-violent exploitation flicks go. But it is a deeply problematic one. And that problem boils down to this: It’s the absolute wrong movie at the absolute wrong time.
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,"Although he races through the occasional blasts of gritty action, Roth slows things down whenever Paul corners one of the people who killed his wife, the director sinking his teeth into long torture sequences or terse dialogue scenes that are punctuated with shocking flashes of gore."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,"A wishy-washy exploitation movie, which doesn’t show any real verve until the climax."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,40,"Sadly, Donald Trump hasn’t quite found his Leni Riefenstahl: this is a film too embarrassed to be what it is. And shorn of capes and costumes, vigilantism is pretty ugly. Though Roth’s gift for the gruesome gives it a small voyeuristic appeal."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,40,"This is a standard vigilante/revenge fantasy too plodding to deliver the base genre goodies, and too simplistic to work as a character study on how a sudden life of violence can irredeemably disrupt an average citizen’s psyche, the way the original film at least half-heartedly attempted to do."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,40,"Quite simply, it’s impossible to “enjoy” a film that makes you feel even worse about the society we live in – especially when it’s so gobsmackingly unaware itself."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,40,All the new Death Wish is truly committed to is getting a rise out of the audience. It’s a first-person-shooter fantasy. The film’s only real view of justice is that it’s a blast.
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,40,"But the real problem is that the picture feels padded. There are endless, and pointless, scenes of radio hosts debating the vigilante violence. And the wildly mismatched shoot-outs — every criminal Kersey goes up against is slow, stupid and a lousy shot — waters down the thrills."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,38,"Preying on a hurting city might be forgiven if the movie was any good. But Willis, who was once a formidable action star, is performing “Die Hard With an Ambien” as he exhibits zero emotion and mutters under his breath like an accountant who’s upset with his boss."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,38,"The new Death Wish is a vigilante film that's also about vigilante film cliches, when it remembers to think about such things, which is only occasionally. Most of its attempts to subvert or freshen up familiar elements aren't well developed, and they're certainly never strong enough to counter the bloodlust and gun worship that's invariably going to power this kind of project."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,33,"Whether uncritically brought over in remake translation or genuinely reaffirmed, the movie’s fucked-up politics poison the fun. By the end, which creates an unmistakably symmetrical arc for Paul, Death Wish has all but devolved into a scare-tactics advertisement for locked-and-loaded home protection."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,30,"Eli Roth and screenwriter Joe Carnahan could have done the same thing, manifesting the rages and fears that afflict the country we live in right now. Instead they offer a cheap and dishonest Death Wish that (references to social media notwithstanding) is interchangeable with get-tough knockoffs that have flooded cinemas for decades."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,30,"Directed by Eli Roth with the same knowing smirk that has informed his previous exercises in self-satisfied bloodletting (""Cabin Fever,"" ""The Green Inferno,"" the ""Hostel"" movies), the movie is a slick, straightforward revenge thriller as well as a sham provocation, pandering shamelessly to the viewer's bloodlust while trying to pass as self-aware satire. Your time, to say nothing of your outrage, is much better spent elsewhere."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,30,"Death Wish takes the serious topic of vigilante violence and reduces it to melodramatic hero worship, and it’s not even particularly good at that. The action is forgettable and the plot barely holds together."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,30,"As soon as Willis deploys his trademark smirk, and the comfortable vengeance of tracking down his wife’s killers while avoiding detection takes over, it just becomes a million other B-movies about lowlifes getting what they deserve."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,25,"Bruce Willis, looking decrepit and acting like he gave his last damn a dozen years ago, stars in what plays like an old man’s movie for angry, emasculated and frightened old men."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,25,"For a while, director Roth plays this stuff relatively straight, and Willis periodically reminds us he can act (the grieving Kersey cries a fair bit here)."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,25,There’s something distinctly odious about a storyteller exploiting both a city’s tragic reality and a country’s debate about firearms to make a film that thrives on violence.
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,20,"A pound-store Tarantino with the sadism dialled up and the wit switched off, Roth has the very basics of a stomach-clenching suspense sequence down pat. It’s just that the film never provides any rationale for why you’d want to submit to it."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,20,"The new Death Wish is unlikely to spark similar controversy, simply because the filmmaking is not as compelling as in the original film."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,20,An imbecilic misfire.
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,20,"This could be satire, but Roth and screenwriter Joe Carnahan refuse to take a stance. Ironically, a film about a guy with guts doesn’t have any itself."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,12,The only thing stopping Roth's film from being an irredeemable zero-star disaster is its introduction of a dramatic principle that I'm nicknaming Chekhov's Gun Cabinet – but that's hardly justice for such a recklessly criminal cinematic act as Death Wish.
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,0,"At a time when Americans are constantly bombarded with reports of unpunished police brutality, the film suggests that the true problem with justice in our country is that law enforcement isn't violent enough."
Darkman,6.4,33878502,88,"Darkman is funny, but it’s no joke; it’s the work of a man who underlines the conventions of adventure stories and horror because he enjoys them, and knows that even when rendered tongue-in-cheek, they’re timeless."
Darkman,6.4,33878502,83,Darkman is a thrillingly demented pop spectacular: a grade-B movie made by a grade-A lunatic.
Darkman,6.4,33878502,80,"Darkman, as unnerving as a gargoyle, is a classic nightmare, elegant and sumptuous, everything ""Batman"" should have been. But we're numbed after a while, as we are by the grotesquerie of the nightly news. Then again, maybe that's Raimi's intention. His work is beautiful in its scary way, and never only skin deep."
Darkman,6.4,33878502,75,"Darkman sustains mild interest throughout, but it never takes off, partly because a real-estate scam, gangland shootouts, city corruption and a love story clutter up the sad story of Westlake's strange mutation."
Darkman,6.4,33878502,75,"Certainly not Raimi at his best, but some knowing genre nods and an array of great effects make up much of the deficit."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,65,"Geostorm is as dumb as you think, but more fun than you might expect."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,41,"Just as trying to keep up with every geopolitical crisis on the planet all at once can be overwhelming, trying to track Geostorm’s name-checked concerns and its barely present characters is likely to tax viewers’ attention spans. Horror movies help people process some of our worst fears, but there’s a reason most movies don’t try to address every human fear at the same time."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,40,"Yes, Geostorm is bad, but it’s not a stinker for the ages."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,40,We have been sold a false bill of goods.
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,40,"Geostorm is a watery blend of Armageddon and 24, with enough action to entertain on a basic level. It’ll probably be most appealing to scientists looking for a good laugh."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,40,It’s an action movie without an exciting moment. It’s a special effects flick with chintzy visuals. And it’s a Gerard Butler vehicle without enough Gerard to go around.
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,38,"Geostorm isn’t “Olympus Has Fallen” or “Gods of Egypt.” It’s no better or worse than any of them, but it gives one little hope for the upcoming “Hunter Killer” or “Den of Thieves” or, for that matter, “Angel Has Fallen,” sequel to “London Has Fallen” which was a sequel to “Olympus Has Fallen.” Butler is in a bad-movie rut."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,38,Geostorm fails to work either as awe-inspiring spectacle or as campy silliness.
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,33,"Butler sleepwalks through his thinly written role, and the ostensible tension between the two brothers, flaring up whenever the energy starts to sag, never feels like anything but a bald contrivance."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,30,"When the long-promised global barrage of tornadoes, lightning strikes, tidal waves and extreme temperatures hits in the final half-hour, the special effects are stunning. But the razzle-dazzle arrives too late, and is strangely unmoving."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,25,"Unfortunately, the gleefully absurd ingenuity of Geostorm stops at its title."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,25,"Geostorm finds itself in the curious position of simultaneously taking itself too seriously and not enough so. It’s a disaster movie far too ridiculous to generate any real gravitas, but it’s also just glum enough to suck any fun out of watching the beaches of Rio de Janeiro freeze over in an instant."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,25,"The inconvenient truth about Geostorm is that it’s dumber than a box of asteroid-sized hail. But to take it seriously for just a second, it misses an opportunity to turn idealism about the world coming together to solve its biggest problem and instead turns it into more of cinema’s biggest problem: empty-headed spectacle."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,25,A disastrous disaster movie that is actually quite low on the disasters to its own detriment.
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,20,"Geostorm is so punishingly bad it makes Independence Day: Resurgence look like Last Year at Marienbad. (Or at least its less well-known sequel, Last Year at Marienbad: Resurgence.)"
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,20,"Geostorm’s disasters are just barrages of drab, anonymous digi-porridge, with a very occasional unhinged flourish thrown in, such as a stadium that’s struck by lightning and immediately explodes."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,20,"Big, dumb, and boring, it finds the cowriter of Independence Day hoping to start a directing career with the same playbook — but forgetting several rules of the game."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,20,Geostorm uses digital technology to lay waste to a bunch of cities and hacky screenwriting to assault the dignity of several fine actors.
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,16,"Geostorm is terrible entertainment, but it’s a remarkably effective window into Donald Trump’s soul."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,11,"Not a single character or the jeopardy that they find themselves in – end of the entire human race and all – is likable, canine-in-peril excluded."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,10,"Even though no movie that lends itself to individually tailored special effects should be a royal snoozefest, it’s 2017 and everything is awful, and so, too, is Geostorm, a disaster movie without a disaster and an apocalypse flick lacking the apocalypse."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,10,"The only thing more reliable than bad weather is bad movies, and in that respect, Geostorm is right on forecast."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,60,"Thank heavens — or at least the “Department of Eternal Affairs” — for Jeff Bridges, whose hilariously free-associative performance as a 19th-century frontier marshal-turned-21st-century undead lawman is like an adrenaline shot to the heart of R.I.P.D."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,58,"While he's (Bridges) having more fun than anyone in the audience is likely to be having, it's such a rip-snorting go-for-broke performance that it almost makes R.I.P.D. worth the price of admission. Almost."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,50,"Nothing short of wiping their memories with a real-life neuralizer is going to convince moviegoers that the supernatural buddy-cop comedy R.I.P.D. is anything more than a thinly disguised ""Men In Black"" ripoff."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,50,"A film that grows less compelling and original by the minute, R.I.P.D. serves due notice that the mismatched-buddy-cop movie is wearing out its welcome all over again."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,40,"Confusing and uninspired rather than completely inept, it’s still likely to be swiftly struck from the résumés of all involved."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,38,"R.I.P.D. devotes far more energy to concept than execution, leaving most of the promising aspects high and dry."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,38,"There is less eye candy than you would expect, and it’s underwhelming."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,38,"In R.I.P.D., we have a legitimate train wreck of a motion picture: a film that doesn't work on any level. It's not funny. It's not exciting. It's not engaging. It's a waste of time and money."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,38,"Perhaps there was a clever germ of an idea here, but the five credited writers didn't develop characters, scenarios or rules in this sci-fi world well enough to engage the audience."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,38,The worst comic book adaptation since “Jonah Hex.”
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,36,"There is a legitimate film in here somewhere, buried deep beneath the rubble of its terrible script and editing."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,30,"With its low-stakes chase scenes, obvious-from-the-get-go villains and nonsensical plotting, this feels more like a 96-minute-long episode of Scooby-Doo that's been laboriously translated into another language and then back into English."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,30,It's an unpleasant way to pass a couple summer hours.
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,30,"Unfortunately, the interesting drabness of the afterlife’s police department is paired with the colorless paucity of the film’s heavies...The deados, unmemorable CG brutes, spout generic bad-guy dialogue undistinguished by humor or characterization."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,30,"The entire film has an oddly underdone quality to it, as if aiming not for greatness but to simply be passable."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,25,"Mostly loud and graceless, despite some arresting hyperbolic visuals that deserve an action film of actual soul and purpose. It's simply too generic at heart to justify director Schwentke's delirious, sidewinding, arcing, snap-zooming and whip-panning anti-gravity camerawork."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,25,A dud that squanders a decent cast and succeeds neither as the comedy nor the action film it purports to be.
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,20,"R.I.P.D. never creates a believable universe, interesting action sequences, or dynamic characters. It’s a paint-by-numbers approach in which the film’s comedy and drama both fall flat."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,20,It's nothing special. Which sort of makes it a loser all the way 'round. Expect a sad afterlife for it on cable.
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,20,Tired byplay between Reynolds’s mystified straight man and Bridges’s supernatural old pro will kill off any fond memories you have of zesty buddy films past and present.
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,20,"What’s missing is what’s often absent in industrial moviemaking of this type: story and characters, yes, but also the human touch and a sense that someone behind the scenes actually cares about the work."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,20,"Less a bad movie than simply not a movie, R.I.P.D. gives every indication of having been a sloppy first-draft script."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,20,"It so shamelessly borrows from so many other movies, and then does absolutely nothing to add to them -- nothing to raise the bar, nothing to make it more interesting, and really nothing to make it the least bit appealing."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,20,This is a second-rate special effects-dominated 3D entry that will join several prominent would-be blockbusters that need not be mentioned on the summer junk heap.
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,12,"For a movie that so strenuously rips off “Ghostbusters” and “Men in Black,” R.I.P.D. manages to come up with fresh new ways of being absolutely terrible."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,10,"The whole thing seems ill-conceived from the start, unable to keep its parameters simple – think of Ghostbusters and “Don’t cross the streams!” – but also lacking any genuine comic spark or imagination. It’s an exhausting 98 minute ride to nowhere."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,0,"This expensive misfire runs a little less than ninety minutes, which means that there’s likely a 105-110 minute long version that the producers hacked up in order to get the maximum amount of 3D showtimes to not embarrass the studio on opening weekend. Judging by the released product, that version is likely even worse, if such a thing were possible."
Muppet Treasure Island,7,33609000,83,"Tim Curry makes a fine, flashy Long John Silver, and charming newcomer Kevin Bishop is a lively, toothy young Jim Hawkins, but it’s Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat who make Muppet Treasure Island, the Muppets musical adaptation of the Robert Louis Stevenson, novel a hoot."
Muppet Treasure Island,7,33609000,75,"Muppet Treasure Island is an elaborate, juicy eyeful. The film is an impressive maze of visual scale and perspective that lets humans and puppets interact as a single species. The overall effect is a wonderful sense of the fantastical. But simplicity might have helped where the movie often stagnates with gimmicks."
Muppet Treasure Island,7,33609000,75,"Jim Henson's creations have always appealed on more than one level, offering adorable playmates and positive messages to children and surprisingly sophisticated humor to adults. MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND, the fifth big screen feature to star Kermit the Frog and friends, and the second directed by Brian Henson, delivers exactly what fans -- young and old -- expect."
Muppet Treasure Island,7,33609000,75,"Muppet Treasure Island, directed by Brian Henson, son of the late Muppet genius, will entertain you more or less in proportion to your affection for the Muppets. If you like them, you'll probably like this."
Muppet Treasure Island,7,33609000,75,"After the delightful Muppet Christmas Carol, this fourth Kermit and pals star vehicle comes as a slight disappointment, but it's a treat all the same."
Muppet Treasure Island,7,33609000,75,"This adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure novel features plenty of not-too-menacing pirates, and exactly the sort of schtick one expects from the Muppets. It will provide an entertaining diversion for children and adults."
Muppet Treasure Island,7,33609000,75,"Kermit, who takes to the role of Smollet like a grunion to running, is commanding, but it is Piggy as Smollet's castaway flame who puts much-needed wind into the movie's luffing sails. Clad in a muumuu and clamshells, she sets Kermit's timbers a-shivering as in the old days. Their love for each other—like America's love for Muppets—is simply unsinkable."
Muppet Treasure Island,7,33609000,75,The sight of the Muppets making their first movie appearance since 1992's Christmas Carol - with no technological wizardry or flashy special effects applied to update the simple but effective puppetry techniques - proves to be a sobering experience. And the attempt of Jim Henson's bug-eyed creations to keep up with the times results in a breezily entertaining yet old-fashioned brew.
Muppet Treasure Island,7,33609000,75,"In this sendup of Treasure Island, there are no compelling heroes or villains, and the suspense is minimal. Most of the fun lies in watching the Muppets defuse the swashbuckling tale of its scariness by superimposing their own precociously verbal identities onto their characters."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,75,"A loose, lighthearted romp that's a notch above the usual buddy comedies."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,63,"This is probably Murphy's best comedic performance since ""Bowfinger."" The adrenaline is pumping and the outrageousness is dialed all the way up. Murphy is often funny, and occasionally hilarious."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,63,"The missing ingredient, of course, is script."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,60,"No less than four screenwriters are credited, yet the script is filled with the usual clichés (hello, red digital readout!) and supposed twists that can be seen a mile away."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,60,"Between spy training and sensitivity training, the two (Murphy/Wilson) prove nicely matched comic foils."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,60,"I Spy confirms Wilson's ability to turn mediocre, mercenary endeavors into fun crowd-pleasers. Of course, Wilson starring in I Spy is like Phil Jackson coaching a junior-high basketball team, but as long as the results are this entertaining, it's doubtful audiences will care."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,50,"TV's ''I Spy'' knew how to swing. The movie 'I Spy knows only how to scramble and string together moments of Murphy braggadocio and Wilson stoner-ocity, and the sweat shows."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,50,"It's precisely the lineup of familiar past work that makes I Spy pretty dull goods, invigorated mainly by the sharp interplay between Murphy and Wilson, both of whom shine best when they have a sidekick to work with."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,50,"Up against the wit and teamwork of the sparkling TV original, this lame vehicle sputters and fades."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,50,"The movie comes to life when Murphy and Wilson are trading one-liners, and then puts itself on hold for spy and action sequences of stunning banality."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,50,"Too much of the humor falls flat. Thomas' numerous chase sequences through the streets, over the rooftops and through the airways of Budapest seem numbingly repetitive, and the script's reliance on castration gags betrays its overall lack of imagination."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,42,"The real problem with the new film, however, is a certain lack of chemistry between the leads; Wilson is game, as always, but his part is seriously underwritten, and while Murphy raises trash talking to the level of a fine art, he seems to be operating in another movie altogether."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,40,"Spoof or tongue in cheek update, the movie squanders the lion's share of its time on tired, cartoon-quality sequences choreographed around ho-hum chases and explosions. None possess the satiric zip of Austin Powers-style parody."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,40,"Mostly I Spy, with more dead spots than a Jerry Lewis telethon, is content to mark time. That gives us, and perhaps the cast as well, the opportunity to reflect on how satisfying this film could have been if anyone had thought it worth their while to provide real material for the talent to work with."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,40,"Buffeted by the usual car crashes and explosions, Wilson and Murphy never develop any comic chemistry."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,40,"The sex bits are flat, the racial innuendo is flatter, and somewhere, Cosby is having a Pudding Pop and shaking his head in disbelief."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,38,"I cry for I Spy or I would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-TV spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind. Comas are physical, not emotional."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,38,Their (Murphy/Wilson) exchanges and interplay are so campy and over the top that I kept expecting them to pull out frying pans and start bopping each other over the head with them. I Spy is one just Stooge short of homage.
I Spy,5.4,33561137,38,"The execution is so dumbed-down, so dumbfounding, that sophisticated moviegoers might confuse it for outtakes from ""Spy Kids 2"" and ""XXX."""
I Spy,5.4,33561137,38,"An overblown clunker full of bad jokes, howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,38,"The movie is so thoroughly lousy. It's loud, brash and obvious, full of car chases and explosions and gunplay."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,30,"Something lazy, slow, shallow, stupid, amateurish, unfunny, unsuspenseful, uninformed, unspeakably dull and witlessly written, directed and acted (the special effects suck, too)."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,30,Even the handful of moments that are amusing feel recycled from old sketches of Mr. Murphy's.
I Spy,5.4,33561137,30,"Though ample time is spent mingling Murphy's jabberjaw locutions and Wilson's curveball spaciness, the film leaves only the bitter reek of a botched chemistry experiment."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,30,Moves at a glacial pace.
I Spy,5.4,33561137,30,"Exhausts you with its derivative stupidity, leaving you weak and bored and weary of comedy that's not funny, action that's not exciting, dialogue that's not clever. It's not even an adequate rip-off of the TV show."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,30,"Hollywood's Thanksgiving turkey arrives today - 27 days early - in the gobbling guise of the heavily hyped, brain-dead comedy, I Spy."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,25,"Nothing is real, but at the same time, nothing is fake. Nothing is, period. You don't believe a second of it for a second, so banal and predictable is it."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,25,"Just plain dismal, an inexplicable mining of old, mid-level programming that has all the raging excitement of continental drift."
Silverado,7.2,33200000,88,"This movie is more sophisticated and complicated than the Westerns of my childhood, and it is certainly better looking and better acted."
Silverado,7.2,33200000,80,"Silverado is sufficiently modern to make its landscapes bigger, its people smaller and its moral polarities less powerfully distinct than those of simpler, more starkly beautiful westerns gone by."
Silverado,7.2,33200000,80,"Rather than relying on legendary heroes of Westerns past, writer-director Lawrence Kasdan with his brother Mark have used their special talent to create a slew of human scale characters against a dramatic backdrop borrowing from all the conventions of the genre."
Silverado,7.2,33200000,80,Engrossing western which inspired a huge genre revivial.
Silverado,7.2,33200000,70,"It's best when the carefully chosen cast throws itself into developing characters and building their relationships. When pure storytelling takes over after an hour or so, the picture becomes less original and engaging."
Silverado,7.2,33200000,63,"Between the gratuitous climaxes that seem to occur every 10 minutes, Kasdan parades a myriad of stereotypes before us and never develops them.  In fact, he never really explores any of his characters but only provides them with enough motivation to justify the slaughter of dozens of people."
Silverado,7.2,33200000,63,"Agreeable but never compelling, Silverado proves it takes more than love of the western to make a good one. Maybe the dudes at K-Tell were a mite too slick for the job."
Silverado,7.2,33200000,63,"This 1985 western does a decent job of developing some dry 80s humor without completely undermining the genre, yet Kasdan's considerable skills as a plot carpenter seem to desert him as soon as the story moves to the town of the title--the action turns choppy, confused, and arbitrary."
Dracula 2000,4.9,33022767,50,"One way or the other, there really is something to be said for a movie which seems to revel in its own inherent comic-book silliness."
Dracula 2000,4.9,33022767,50,Dracula 2000 is at heart a solidly old-fashioned cloak-and-fangs vampire flick. It honors the central traditions of the form a lot more often than it skewers them.
Dracula 2000,4.9,33022767,50,"Although it's not half bad -- which doesn't mean it's half good -- this horror cheapie comes equipped with a few ideas, a little atmosphere and a couple of serviceable scares."
Dracula 2000,4.9,33022767,50,"A middling film through and through, despite the occasional shocks it tries to earnestly to achieve."
Dracula 2000,4.9,33022767,50,One of those desultory F/X and no script potboilers that seems to restart itself with every new scene.
Dracula 2000,4.9,33022767,42,In the end it's the same old blood pudding.
Dracula 2000,4.9,33022767,40,"There's a lot of scary stuff in Wes Craven Presents: Dracula 2000. There are eyeball-sucking leeches, decapitations, punctured necks... and appalling acting."
Dracula 2000,4.9,33022767,38,"Overall, though, the slapdash pic appears to be the work of folks who made things up as they went along; you might say they were, well, vamping."
Dracula 2000,4.9,33022767,30,The gratuitous use of the city (New Orleans) during Mardi Gras is the least of this movie's unoriginal sins.
Dracula 2000,4.9,33022767,20,Dracula 2000 is a stake in the heart.
Dracula 2000,4.9,33022767,17,"Dracula may stay undead in the new millennium, but there's not a sign of life - oh, that bloodless acting - in this sorry mess."
Dracula 2000,4.9,33022767,10,It's a little sad to see actors of the quality of Christopher Plummer and Jonny Lee Miller struggling straight- faced to dignify this sewage.
TRON,6.8,33000000,100,"Here's a technological sound-and-light show that is sensational and brainy, stylish, and fun."
TRON,6.8,33000000,75,"The story is simple, as befits a movie that's more about visual flash, technical bravura, and ideas than plot and character development. TRON turns into an action-oriented endeavor, with characters attempting to make their way through the video game inspired landscape of the mainframe to the goal that will achieve victory."
TRON,6.8,33000000,75,"Tron's thematic overtures have a certain silly charm, enhancing rather than detracting from its core virtues. What really makes Tron work is an astonishing sense of design."
TRON,6.8,33000000,70,"Jeff Bridges seems to be the only one having fun, playing a videogame designer who gets sucked into a Day-Glo world of his own creation. It’s like Alice in Wonderland acted out on a kids’ Lite-Brite toy."
TRON,6.8,33000000,67,"Dazzling but lightweight epic about a young scientist kidnapped into a computer, where he battles an evil master control program that runs the place like an electronic fascist. Has some tantalizing moments, as when computer-generated characters debate the religious question of whether users really exist. In the end, though, it's squarely in the old Walt Disney tradition of anthropomorphizing everything in sight, only this time it's circuits (instead of cuddly animals) that look and talk like people."
TRON,6.8,33000000,63,"It's intelligently conceived (on a visual level, at any rate) and largely good fun. Steven Lisberger, an East Coast animator, directed the visuals, combining the actors and computer graphics with satisfying results."
TRON,6.8,33000000,60,"It is beautiful -spectacularly so, at times - but dumb. Computer fans may very well love it, because Tron is a nonstop parade of stunning computer graphics, accompanied by a barrage of scientific-sounding jargon. Though it's certainly very impressive, it may not be the film for you if you haven't played Atari today."
TRON,6.8,33000000,50,"A sympathetic but slightly clumsy rewrite of The Wizard of Oz, with a whizkid programmer (Bridges) trapped inside a computer world. The film boasts some impressive computer-generated animation, but for all its inventiveness, Tron never reaches a level of excitement commensurate with its effects budget."
TRON,6.8,33000000,50,"The best visual design in the world doesn't mean a thing unless there's someone around with a rudimentary sense of story. Jeff Bridges, playing the human hero sucked into the machine, has to carry the film's entire burden of charm and appeal; he seems to have freaked out under the strain, turning in some surpassingly weird, alienating work."
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,91,"The most unexpectedly audacious, exhilarating, wildly creative adventure thriller I've seen in ages."
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,75,It falls short where it counts: In the final confrontation.
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,75,"A straightforward, no-nonsense, agreeably old-fashioned historical action movie."
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,70,For the most part it delivers the goods.
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,67,"A well-marbled, albeit derivative, slab of action-movie man meat."
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,63,Gives you the delirious thrill of ripping off your enemy's head and watching the blood gush by providing a ringside seat.
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,60,Bloody but anemic story.
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,50,Thinking too much about the contents will ruin what little pleasure there is in the experience.
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,50,"Reminiscent of the opening moments of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" actually, only without the clever wit."
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,50,Overwhelmingly grisly.
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,50,Too lightweight and streamlined to be memorable.
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,50,"McTiernan's extensive action background is nowhere evident in the murky, all-but-impossible to follow battle sequences."
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,42,Indulges in enough grubby histrionics and costume-adventure cliches to give you fifth-grade flashbacks.
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,40,"Just a great, empty wind machine."
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,40,Lumbering from one expensive set piece to the next without taking the time to tell us a story that might make us care.
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,40,"With the possible exception of the action sequences and the occassionally imaginitive set design, it's awful."
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,40,Silly supernatural Viking epic.
The 13th Warrior,6.6,32698899,40,"Mud-stained, blood-soaked and completely useless."
Hung fan kui,6.8,32392047,100,"Rumble in the Bronx has the explosive escapades that Stallone/Schwarzenegger followers crave - hair-raising free falls, hovercrafts out of control, crazed turf wars, collapsing buildings, gun-happy gangsters and other boy-film staples - plus the kind of oddball comedy and independent spirit usually found only outside the current Hollywood empire. Chan is a true artist of a genre that ordinarily does all it can to avoid art."
Hung fan kui,6.8,32392047,100,"Any attempt to defend this movie on rational grounds is futile. The whole point is Jackie Chan,  he does what he does better than anybody. He's having fun. If we allow ourselves to get in the right frame of mind, so are we."
Hung fan kui,6.8,32392047,75,"The movie is a giddy triple somersault of a film that makes no sense whatsoever, although in its best moments it is as much fun to watch as a death-defying circus act."
Hung fan kui,6.8,32392047,75,"This is a good introduction to the affable Chan persona. The comedy is broad, the inner-city Americana hilariously off-base, and the English dubbing may prove disconcerting to U.S. audiences. But the cheesiness is part of the fun."
Hung fan kui,6.8,32392047,75,You watch these impossible stunts with fear and gratitude for the hardest-working man in show biz. To see your first Jackie Chan movie is to fall in love with what the movies once were: a comic ballet of bodies in motion.
Hung fan kui,6.8,32392047,75,"While not quite up to the standard of Chan's finest movies, Rumble in the Bronx is fast-paced, funny, and exciting, and should serve as a nice introduction for the uninitiated to the hyperactive world of Hong Kong action filmmaking."
Hung fan kui,6.8,32392047,75,"Rumble in the Bronx never quite achieves the smack-you-around zest of Chan's Hong Kong pictures. Still, it's hard to dislike a movie with such a friendly sense of the preposterous."
Hung fan kui,6.8,32392047,70,"Although Rumble in the Bronx isn't Chan's best work it's still ninety minutes of solid, campy entertainment. Most of the running time is devoted to the slickly choreographed action scenes, leaving virtually no room for plot or character development."
Hung fan kui,6.8,32392047,70,"A mainly routine Hong Kong action film from fleet and floppy-haired action hero Jackie Chan. It's light on plot and character, but the stunts are well staged."
Hung fan kui,6.8,32392047,70,"Filmed in Vancouver (which looks like nobody's idea of the Bronx), the film is a throwback to the hoary chop-socky conventions that gave Hong Kong cinema its shabby reputation."
Hung fan kui,6.8,32392047,70,Though Chan wins his usual stripes for death-defying... the movie ends on a dramatically unsatisfying note.
Hung fan kui,6.8,32392047,67,"Judged by any rational standards, Rumble is absolute bollocks, but it at least has some pretty darned amazing Chan fight scenes."
Hung fan kui,6.8,32392047,67,"It's not often you find a movie as exciting and awful as Rumble in the Bronx. But the sole aim of this so-bad-it's-funny action picture is to introduce Jackie Chan to American audiences. In that narrow sense, it's completely successful."
Hung fan kui,6.8,32392047,63,"With his mop-top cut and silly grin, Chan cuts an amiable figure, but while this film may confirm his skills and appeal to those already familiar with his better work, it's not likely to convert anyone else."
Hung fan kui,6.8,32392047,60,An awkward hybrid of Asian and American film techniques. It's also an uninvolving story that casts Chan in the role of a fish out of water and gives him little opportunity to show his exuberant personality.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,70,Sufficient cheap thrills and enough of the prevailing camp quality.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,70,"Sublimely trashy, this conceptual sequel to 1997's surprise hit, ""Anaconda,"" doesn't expect to be taken any more seriously than its schlock predecessor, and keeps its tongue-in-cheek thrills flowing rapidly."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,70,A highly entertaining movie assured of its genre-jumping potential.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,70,"Funny, suspenseful, and well paced, this is definitely the summer's best time waster."

Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,58,"For all its improbable characters, wretched dialogue and stock situations, the movie has an earnest dumbness that sneaks up on you to be surprisingly entertaining."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,58,The charming thing about Anacondas is that it neither takes itself too seriously nor is it steeped in postmodern irony.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,50,"To be fair, it's little better or worse than the original. But, to be honest, the original--minus its nascent stars--wasn't very good."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,50,"From its jungle forays to its waterfall tumbles to its deadly spider bites - is entirely, utterly unoriginal."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,50,Supremely silly but undeniably fun sequel.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,50,"A programmer that once upon a time would have played on the bottom half of double bills, Anacondas has no pretensions and gets its little job done effectively, providing some small-scale laughs and chills for the late summer season."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,50,At least director Dwight Little (Free Willy 2) gives us enough B-movie speed to keep Orchid from becoming a fountain of aging.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,50,"Still manages to one-up its predecessor, 1997's unintentionally campy ""Anaconda."""
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,50,"Competent formula entertainment, but doesn't make that leap into pure barminess that inspired ""Anaconda."""
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,40,"Director Dwight Little, who has made many mediocre films as well as the gleefully gory Robert Englund version of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" gets at least one thing right -- he really does take time to establish the characters."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,40,"More tongue in cheek than its predecessor, and yet less over the top, it won't do any permanent damage. Of course, it won't leave much of a lasting impression, either."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,40,Exactly as ordinary as you're already expecting it's going to be.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,38,It's never a good sign when the creepiest moment in a movie about monstrous 50-foot snakes is the sight of 2-inch leeches sucking on someone's back.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,38,The biggest problem with the corny horror film Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid is that its titular reptiles are about as scary as jellied eels.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,38,"There's nothing really wrong with it -- it's bad,
but no worse than it needs to be, which is the problem."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,33,"There's no enjoyably outlandish hiss to this variation on the formula, and no Ice Cube or Owen Wilson, either. This time, a ship of capitalist fools (and no movie stars, unless you count utility player Morris Chestnut as a headliner) steams along the river in Borneo."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,30,What they don't do often enough is battle anacondas. It's all tease and no payoff.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,30,Clearly a bottom-feeder.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,30,"The real problem isn't that Anacondas is bad  it's just so bland, so unremarkable, so by-the-numbers, and so instantly forgettable that bad might be a step up."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,25,"This movie didn't have to be good, but that it's so boring in its badness is tough to swallow."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,25,"The refined taste insists on risibly bad, on hysterically bad, on poke-your-seatmate-in-the-ribs bad, and this falls well short of that hallowed mark -- it's just routinely bad."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,25,"The sequel might have the formula down, but it lacks everything that made ""Anaconda'' fun."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,20,"When the CGI snakes finally arrive, they look like they've just returned from a guest spot on ""Charmed;"" if the film had cut any more corners, it would have had to borrow graphics from an old Intellivision game."
Stealth,5,32116746,75,"Stick it out through the first ten incoherent minutes or so, and Stealth is an invigorating reward, especially the tense final half-hour."
Stealth,5,32116746,67,"While you're in the theater, it's actually -- heaven help me -- pretty fun to watch."
Stealth,5,32116746,63,This giddy summer extravaganza does deliver aerial thrills with eye-dazzling visuals and ear-smacking (though beautifully designed) sound.
Stealth,5,32116746,63,"If you like hard bodies and hot engines, if you want to feel like you're inside a cockpit or a video game with someone else working the joystick, you'll find decent escape from the summer doldrums in Stealth."
Stealth,5,32116746,60,"If the Navy is looking for splashy recruiting tools, it could do worse than Stealth, a zillion-dollar action movie stuffed with futuristic jet fighters, glamorous carrier pilots and an overload of explosive, mostly digital derring-do."
Stealth,5,32116746,60,"A slick piece of summer entertainment that is counting on elaborate special effects to make its derivative, convoluted story line all but irrelevant."
Stealth,5,32116746,60,"On one level, Stealth is technically breathtaking, viscerally thrilling action cinema of the highest order. On another, it is slavering, state-of-the-art war porn."
Stealth,5,32116746,50,"A sort of retarded ""Top Gun,"" Rob Cohen's Stealth revisits the world of cocky fighter pilots and war games turned real, but it has some serious moral quandaries on the brain, and too much thinking gets it into trouble."
Stealth,5,32116746,50,"Even Cohen can't dull the loony romanticism of the movie’s finale and, to his credit, stages one truly spectacular bit of action midway through, when Biel bails out behind enemy lines and narrates each harrowing moment of her earthward plummet."
Stealth,5,32116746,50,"Though Stealth's strengths are obvious -- high-tech marvels and a good cast -- so are its flaws. At its worst moments, a mad robot seems to have taken over the movie, too."
Stealth,5,32116746,50,"Makes a serviceable summer shoot-'em-up, but it's surprisingly trashy and rather stupid, and its efforts toward being a gripping military drama in the Tom Clancy tradition are fairly pathetic."
Stealth,5,32116746,50,"While it's loaded with visceral thrills, it never rises above the level of an extended video game or an advertisement for the military."
Stealth,5,32116746,42,"Stealth, a dregs-of-summer knockoff, is too ponderous and inept to serve a comparable function now, yet the film's lack of thrust may be related to an absence of conviction about its own war-is-a-videogame clichés."
Stealth,5,32116746,40,"Hollywood's latest virtual movie, features impressive action sequences -- all created through technology -- a thin story, cardboard characters and snicker-inducing dialogue."
Stealth,5,32116746,40,"Aiming to join the Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay school of American movie war games, Stealth is just too dumb to make the grade."
Stealth,5,32116746,40,Plays like a slapdash assemblage of the greatest hits of conspiracy-minded action cinema.
Stealth,5,32116746,38,"Plastic characters, chaotic camerawork, lots of things blowing up, and an incredibly dumb screenplay. In short, it represents a great time at the movies for anyone who has recently undergone a frontal lobotomy."
Stealth,5,32116746,38,"If Stealth were a recruitment film for aircraft-carrier duty, one would be tempted to say, ""Mission accomplished."" As a feature film, it's a washout."
Stealth,5,32116746,38,"Stealth is an offense against taste, intelligence and the noise pollution code -- a dumbed-down ""Top Gun"" crossed with the HAL 9000 plot from ""2001."""
Stealth,5,32116746,38,"Flimsy and forgettable, but it does have a few worthy action and special-effects sequences."
Stealth,5,32116746,30,The dialogue is often drowned out by engine noise.
Stealth,5,32116746,30,"What's interesting about Stealth isn't its nitwit story... No, what's interesting about this movie - and many others of its kind - is that it continues the love affair Hollywood, that hotbed of liberalism, has long had with militarism."
Stealth,5,32116746,30,"The scene where a pilot bails out in Stealth is so over-painted with CGI that it doesn't look as real as the sequence starring Shepard that inspired it in ""The Right Stuff,"" a movie made with model airplanes."
Stealth,5,32116746,25,Stealth is basically the kind of movie a 13-year-old boy given an infinite budget and creative freedom might cook up between Xbox games.
Stealth,5,32116746,25,"It's astonishing what little impact even the most imaginatively choreographed and well-filmed aerial escapades can have when they're presented as neither an expression of a character's personality, nor in the context of a compelling mission."
Stealth,5,32116746,25,"Cohen (The Fast and the Furious, xXx) is no stranger to cornball excess but Stealth is his chef-d'oeuvre, a movie so audaciously preposterous and jingoistic it plays like a parody of the genre."
Stealth,5,32116746,25,"Its action sequences, more geeky than thrilling, fail to rescue the laughable plot."
Stealth,5,32116746,20,"Even by the degraded standards of dim-witted summer blockbusters, this is sorry stuff."
Stealth,5,32116746,20,"For a movie to pretend, in the face of the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi men, women, and children directly or indirectly caused by our presence there, that we can wage war without anyone really getting hurt isn't naive, or wishful thinking, or a jim-dandy way to spend a Saturday night at the movies. It's an obscenity."
Stealth,5,32116746,12,It's not new. It's not interesting. I wish it would go away.
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,100,"A great American movie about the greatness of ordinary Americans, Patriots Day combines an electrifying manhunt with the intimacy and feel for character writer-director Peter Berg showed in his brilliant TV series “Friday Night Lights.”"
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,91,"Berg’s approach is blunt and effective. With Patriots Day, he’s made an action film that grabs you by the throat and doesn’t let up."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,88,"Overall, this is a Boston Strong film about one of the worst terrorist attacks ever on American soil, and a community’s resounding response."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,83,"Like Lone Survivor and Deepwater Horizon before, Patriots Day is a brawny procedural, more than the exploitation flick it could be. Berg and Wahlberg's commitment to details beyond death and destruction feels like a calling."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,80,"Still, it’s one of the terrorist's wives (Melissa Benoist) who carries the film’s most riveting and provocative scene."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,80,"Patriots Day, muscular and confident, falls right in line with Berg’s other work. And you might feel a little dirty after watching it, as if you’d been granted access to real-life suffering and tragedy that perhaps should have remained private."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,80,"Formally, Berg's film is at its root a police procedural, albeit an exceptionally well-executed one."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,80,"The hurtling action, speaking louder than any dialogue, gives a stirring sense of the suffering and heroism that flowed from the terror at the Boylston Street finish line."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,80,"An effective, efficient and quite dramatic examination of the events surrounding the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing that killed three and injured 264, Patriots Day is a tribute to people who earned it: the investigators and first responders who ensured that a horrible situation did not become even worse."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,80,"It’s genuinely exciting megaplex entertainment, informed by extensive research, featuring bona fide movie stars, and staged with equal degrees of professionalism and respect."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,80,There’s little doubt who the hero of Peter Berg’s retelling of the 2013 Boston marathon bombings is: the city itself.
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"A taut, riveting police procedural that maintains suspense even as it finds humor in the people, their funny accents and way with profanity, and pathos."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,Berg also creates one scene that should stand as an all-time classic: a residential street standoff between the Tsarnaevs and members of the Boston and neighbouring Watertown police departments.
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"Far from being exploitative, Patriots Day honors the Bostonians who responded to terrorism with strength."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"As with all of Berg’s films, Patriots Day does an excellent job with sets and locales and is compulsively watchable."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"For all its rough edges and gruesome touches, Patriots Day is a heartfelt and ambitious attempt to turn mayhem into something that’s emotionally valid."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"In other hands, Patriots Day could have been a paint-by-the numbers action thriller, but strong performances and well-paced momentum make it an engrossing watch."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"The question is, How big an audience is ready to relive the horror of a tragedy so close to home, especially in the light of the terrorist attacks that continue to assault our senses daily?"
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"Berg's unquestioning faith in law and order could have used, well, a little questioning. But there's no doubt about the worth of the movie as a well-earned tribute to the heroes and victims of a tragic event that may have just made Boston stronger."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"The movie, none too revelatory, mostly just stands as a sturdy thriller, one that’s more fleet than flat-footed as it shuttles among a veritable network of characters and story lines."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"As long as Patriots Day is concerned with recreating the sense of ambient chaos among sparring investigators and an anxious community, it’s immersive and thrilling."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"Historians, media scholars and even Boston citizens may debate whether this is the most worthy way to honor those fallen in the attacks. But Berg mounts a heartfelt, harrowing tribute to the film’s real-life heroes."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,70,"Patriots Day is a well-meaning, well-executed movie that tells the story of the Boston Marathon bombings of 2013 as a crime thriller — an interesting choice that works well, for the most part."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,70,"With Patriots Day, Peter Berg translates national tragedy to cinema screens with power and purpose for the second time this year – yet the question for many is with wounds still healing, do we really need to be subjected to recreations of a hateful act still fresh in our nation’s history?"
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,70,"My reservations about such pictures in general were not put to rest by Patriots Day, but this film’s real merits are not easily dismissed either."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,70,"Like the heroic Bostonians it celebrates, civilians and law enforcement both, Peter Berg’s Patriots Day gets the job done."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,70,"As a retelling of a tragedy that had its moments of heroism among uniformed personnel and indefatigable civilians alike, it gets the job done."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,67,"The film, which swivels frantically between first responders, survivors, and investigators, has a percussive force, but its best scene, unbearably tense, is a quiet one, when a Chinese app designer (an excellent Jimmy O. Yang) is carjacked by the Tsarnaev brothers."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,67,"Patriots Day benefits from a robust, concentrated timeline and sheer bat-out-of-hell pacing."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,63,"If you’re looking for great, realistic action, it’s just the thing. Berg is a masterful action director, and his Patriots Day is every bit as engaging and exciting as ""Lone Survivor"" and ""Deepwater Horizon."""
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,63,"After dispensing with the sluggish setup of the film’s first act, Berg shifts into high gear, powerfully evoking the feelings of dread and white-knuckle excitement that much of America no doubt felt as the manhunt progressed."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,63,The hero worship of a fictional character in the midst of all of this real-life drama is a mistake.
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,60,"Patriots Day is stirring, well-acted, moving and built with conviction and flair. But a film about such a senseless attack shouldn’t be scared, now and then, to make a little less sense."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,60,"The third part of Berg’s unofficial Americans-in-crisis trilogy will play better for US audiences than overseas, but it’s still a pacy and often enthralling disaster movie."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,60,Wahlberg may have succeeded in singlehandedly cracking the case and bringing the perpetrators to justice but — like the film itself—he fails to find meaning in the wreckage.
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,60,"As exciting as the film may be, Berg too easily undercuts the human element of his story."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,50,"Patriots Day sits right on the line between exploitation and tribute. The star power is dicey, and the action relentless, but Berg means well and likes the people in his recount."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,50,"So the bottom line: This is an undeniably effective movie that I mostly enjoyed, even though I’m not altogether sure it should ever have been made."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,50,"To its credit, the film doesn’t linger unnecessarily over the horrors, and quickly turns into a police procedural. As the FBI takes over the investigation from the local authorities and sets up a command center, the details of this process are fascinating to observe."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,50,"At best, it's unnecessary. At worst, it's vaguely insulting."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,50,It works so hard to evoke a sense of teary patriotism it leaves behind a grimy feeling.
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,50,"Patriots Day may, in fact, embrace the spirit of the days following the bombing, but the scattered framing leaves one wanting more."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,80,"As irritating as Lake Placid sometimes is, it also has an easygoing sense of fun, along with one of the more memorable movie monsters of recent years.  The mismatched ingredients blend into a blissfully, stupidly surreal summer cocktail."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,80,"A straightforward camping-holiday nightmare, or a sly, ironic take on the same. It works deliciously as both."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,70,"While we do get a bit of gore, the movie is really about this wacky bunch of people jumping on each other's nerves, kind of a zany hero's journey."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,63,"A formulaic thriller, treated in a style that's just shy of outright parody."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,60,"Comes in well under the ninety-minute mark, leaving no room for bombast or overkill."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,50,"The strange thing is that for all of Fonda's whining, Pullman's wary squinting and muttering, the bad dialogue, the cheesy effects, the severed toes, the severed heads, the severed bodies and the cliched directorial choices, Lake Placid adds up to a halfway enjoyable time at the movies."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,50,It also goes out of its way to give you a schlocky B-movie vibe by wrangling bait in the form of a bunch of Big-Gulp stupid stock characters - that's a whopping 44 oz. more stupid than you probably were bargaining for.
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,50,"Its a comedy, a romantic star vehicle, a thriller, a horror movie and a quasi-environmental parable that's calculated to appeal to all demographic groups.  It's not enough of any one of these things to be particularly engaging."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,50,"Smoothly enjoyable, undemanding entertainment and features a couple of knock-out giant croc attacks."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,50,"Trouble is, while not trading quips, the characters actually go through the motions of being scared of the croc, menaced by the croc and so on. And since even the gator horror satire is old hat (remember ''Alligator?''), there's no remaining way to make this interesting."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,40,The only genuine surprises on hand are the few moments when the film defies the expectations that have been programmed into our collective neurons by the past 25 years of horror movies.
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,40,"To be sure, Kelley's Emmy-winning brand of off-kilter humor and cockeyed affection for rural folk is on display, but his attempt here to blend the citified angst of ""Ally McBeal"" (co-star Bridget Fonda was Kelley's first choice as that series' lead) with the countrified absurdisms of ""Picket Fences,"" plus bits out of the Peter Benchley playbook, doesn't hold water."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,30,"It's like a summer stock ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,"" with the proviso that occasionally a giant snaggle-tooth monster slobbers onstage and eats George or Martha."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,30,"It's laughably stupid, only fitfully scary and relatively harmless summer fun  if you're 12 years old, in which case you probably aren't supposed to be going to movies like this anyway."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,30,At least White summons the camp energy that Lake Placid is fecklessly seeking.
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,30,"A bunch of IQ-challenged characters traipsing through a laughably bad scenario brought to life using silly dialogue, banal direction, and questionable special effects."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,25,"Instead of rooting for Pullman and Fonda, we end up praying that the crocodile is hungry enough to put them out of their misery."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,25,"The movie is pretty bad, all right. But it has a certain charm. It's so completely wrong-headed from beginning to end that it develops a doomed fascination."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,25,"A ""croc"" of nonsense."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,25,"It doesn't help that, at 80 or so minutes, it feels like there's a reel missingyou know, the one with the finale that's even slightly more pulse-pounding than any of the four or five other scenes in which the big, impressive-looking monster attacks the heroes as their legs dangle in the water."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,20,"A smallish cast peppered with a pair of bullish performances by both Platt and the lesser-known Gleeson. The two spark some chemistry between them, which is more than can be said for Pullman and Fonda's moribund performances."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,20,"The shticky dialogue undercuts the solid genre plotting, which undercuts the humor."
Lake Placid,5.7,31770414,20,"By the end of this mercifully short excuse for a horror movie, you'll be wishing the beast had chowed down on the entire ensemble."
1941,5.8,31755742,70,"Billed as a comedy spectacle, Steven Spielberg’s 1941 is long on spectacle, but short on comedy. The Universal-Columbia Pictures co-production is an exceedingly entertaining, fast-moving revision of 1940s war hysteria in Los Angeles spawned by the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and boasts Hollywood’s finest miniature and special effects work seen to date."
1941,5.8,31755742,50,"1941 is loaded with slam-bang sight gags and action, but comedy isn't director Steven Spielberg's forte and the movie isn't nearly as funny as it might have been."
1941,5.8,31755742,40,"1941 is less comic than cumbersome, as much fun as a 40-pound wrist-watch."
1941,5.8,31755742,40,"It's not fair to say Steven Spielberg's 1941 lacks ""pacing."" It's got it, all right, but all at the same pace: The movie relentlessly throws gags at us until we're dizzy. It's an attempt at that most tricky of genres, the blockbuster comedy, and it tries so hard to dazzle us that we want a break."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,80,"Statham isn't an actor who coasts, not even in a recklessly enjoyable picture like Transporter 3. He does the work, so we don't have to: His Frank Martin is the personification of pleasure without guilt."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,75,"The villainous Polluter-in-Chief is eloquently played by Robert Knepper, familiarly loathsome as T-Bag on Fox's ""Prison Break."" And when Knepper and Statham get together, there's a fine showdown of grimaces."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,75,What makes it all work is that Frank remains a self-made hero.
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,70,"Overall, the production has the polish and pace that producer/co-writer Luc Besson's work is known for. Any complaints about the lack of substance are pointless."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,70,"The end result is ""Mission: Impossible"" meets ""Speed"": high-tech gizmos, exotic European locales, and hair-raising stunts, many performed by Statham himself, who, when he's not shirtless, looks spiffy in Dior."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,67,"In a series elevated by high-flying ridiculousness, Transporter 3 falls a couple of sequences short of the standard, but it does show off Statham's considerable dirt-biking skills. For that, at least, it's kinda rad."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,63,"Though this third installment is not quite as nuts as the second film, it's nevertheless firmly set in the same ridiculous mold."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,63,A perfectly acceptable brainless action thriller.
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,63,"The best sequences involve Frank's inventive ability to stay within 75 feet of his car, but otherwise, it's the charismatic unruffled dexterity in the face of impossible odds that rivets."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,60,"Though the car chases have grown more banal as the franchise has started to run on fumes, the smackdowns have retained their zing."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,58,"As action movies seem to get more complicated and convoluted with international conspiracies and technological concepts, the ""Transporter"" franchise is refreshingly simple."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,50,"Boasts a measure of the retro machismo, style and attitude some 007 fans have found lacking in ""Quantum of Solace."" But it also has a pointless storyline, incoherent editing and a polyglot cast that renders some of the dialogue utterly incomprehensible."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,50,Transporter 3 is the most frustrating entry into a series that has never set the bar terribly high.
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,50,Transporter 3 is so far over the top that it more than once spills into outright cartoonishness.
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,50,"If you're going to a no-frills action film, though, at least you want the action to be entertaining, which is where Transporter 3 falls down."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,50,Somehow Statham comes out of this improbable thriller with his dignity intact.
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,42,"For those disappointed in the grim, gritty feel of the latest James Bond movie and who long for the absurdity of the Roger Moore-era entries, Transporter 3, ought to fit the bill."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,40,"The movie has more lags in action than either of the previous episodes, and somehow the dialogue is even more daft"
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,40,"The film does contain a couple of interesting thrills here and there. However, this film would have been better off thrown straight to DVD."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,40,"Statham could do these movies in his sleep by now, so he gets credit for offering up so much dry wit. In fact, while Rudakova makes a painful acting debut, Statham appears more engaged than he has in a while."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,40,"Incoherent and inconsistent, this is a step back for Statham in his quest to become more than a cult figure."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,38,The thrill of the ridiculousness is gone. So is all the mystery that made Statham so appealing in the first place.
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,38,"Transporter 3 is made for airplane viewing, and not just any airplane: an Eastern European one, on the flight from Hrubbishnik to Slutnya."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,38,"At one point, Statham chases down a sports car while pedaling madly on a kids' bike. Pathétique!"
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,30,"Easily the worst in a trilogy that has been notable mainly for the presence of its everyman action star, Transporter 3 is a nonsensical, choppily edited bore, with awful dialogue."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,25,"The fight scenes are lackluster and the plot is needlessly complicated. If you're making an action film that centers on fast cars and fast women, it's usually best to keep the rest of the story simple."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,80,This hugely entertaining oddity could never be mistaken for the work of any other filmmaker.
Chappie,6.8,31569268,75,"It’s a good sci-fi action movie, too. Far be it from me to give this movie the kiss of death by making it seem too serious for its core audience. Chappie is everything it has to be — but it’s everything it should be, too."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,75,"Between the charming Copley performance, the ingenious visuals, the absolutely incredible all-electronic Hans Zimmer score (seriously, this is one of his best ever), and the propulsive narrative thrust (Blomkamp is rarely singled out for how swiftly he moves things along, plot holes be damned), there is a lot to appreciate and even love about Chappie."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,70,"There's something fearlessly uncool about the film, which suffers mostly from being made 30 years too late."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,67,"With a titanium body and a child's mind, Chappie is a fascinating figure, vividly rendered, enough so that you wish there was a better movie around him."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,63,This is a well-meaning film with a good idea that unfortunately stumbles on its way to its less-than-satisfying end.
Chappie,6.8,31569268,63,"Chappie boasts so many entertaining elements, particularly the lead motion-capture performance by Blomkamp’s go-to guy Sharlto Copley, its shortcomings don’t sink the movie."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,63,"Chappie is meant to inspire questions about what it means to be human, and at times it does. However, director and co-writer Neill Blomkamp doesn't explore its intriguing premise deeply enough."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,60,"Even at his shakiest, Mr. Blomkamp holds your attention with stories about characters banding together to emerge from a hell not of their own making, a liberation journey that just isn’t the same old, same old when a director was born in South Africa."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,60,"Like its title character, Chappie is stunning to behold and easy to like, but it’s still some way from fully developed."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,60,"Blomkamp’s third movie has just about enough spectacle and quirk to overcome some fairly major flaws, not least of which is an unappealing central trio."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,60,"Chappie is a broad, brash picture, which does not allow itself to get bogged down in arguing about whether or not “artificial intelligence” is possible. It has subversive energy and fun."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,60,"It’s a brawny, inventive action romp that’s as happy firing rockets at helicopters as it is contemplating the Cartesian model of mind-body dualism, which gives it a satisfying, sweet-and-sour tang of its own."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"Now, with Chappie, the director/co-writer returns home for an uneven showcase of impeccable visual effects and lackluster emotional affect."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"Criminally underwritten characters result in actors like Hugh Jackman, Sigourney Weaver, and Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) having little to do."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"When we’re first introduced, he’s an overwhelmed infant, and by the time the credits roll, he’s John McClane. Is that an accurate representation of how artificial intelligence can evolve? Absolutely. Does it make for compelling drama? Not particularly."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"Chappie has a nothing-to-lose Roger Cormanesque quality about it, low on budget (except for the CGI robots) and low on meaning, but full of high-velocity chases, helicopter pursuits, and weapons blasting around empty warehouses marred by graffiti and trash."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"A movie about a robot policeman given a childlike conscience, Chappie is one of those incongruous Franken-films that’s simultaneously bombastically brutal and treacly. Like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial crossed with Transformers, or RoboCop starring Jar Jar Binks, it’s a recipe guaranteed to produce aesthetic indigestion."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"The technology is seamless, the movements are eloquent and the problem may be my own misprogramming, but the robot still looked to me like a man in a robot suit."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"Chappie feels like Blomkamp and his co-writer Terri Tatchell had three or four different films they wanted to make, and instead of figuring out which one actually worked, they just made them all at the same time."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"Like ""Elysium,"" this rusty A.I. story is basically just ""District 9"" with a new coat of paint; it’s distinguished only by the jabbering, irritating personality of its title character."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"Blomkamp regular Sharlto Copley is quite good — as Chappie, in a motion-capture performance. (He also provides the voice of the robot.) If this were somehow a commentary on man's increasing lack of humanity or something, that would be fine. Instead, it's just good work buried inside a movie made up of intriguing ideas that never really go anywhere."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"While it has a few appealing qualities, as a whole it amounts to a well-intentioned bag of missed opportunities."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,42,"The movie's glaring problem is the design and execution of Chappie, whose look is unremarkable except for a pair of polymer rabbit ears ready for meme posterity."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,40,"Chappie is as subtle as a sledgehammer. The latest sci-fi action spectacle from “District 9” and “Elysium” director Neill Blomkamp is also sprawling, bombastic, deafening, ugly and ultra-violent."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,40,"It never winds up with anything particularly interesting or effective to say about life, intelligence, religion, the nature of consciousness, or any of the other big themes it deliberately evokes. It does, however, blow up a lot of stuff."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,40,"Chappie is a bucket of bolts, Blomkamp’s desire to say meaningful things outdistancing his ability to say them compellingly."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,40,It’s too bad that neither the philosophy nor the pyrotechnics on-screen in Chappie can distract you from your own sinking feeling that you’ve seen almost all of this before.
Chappie,6.8,31569268,38,"Blomkamp and his wife and co-writer, Terri Tatchell, stack the deck. Instead of awe, we get ""E.T."" - aww."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,37,"Despite Blomkamp’s efforts to make some kind of commentary about the human soul, which the auteur bolsters with his trademark social consciousness — a tone of preachiness that, after three films, has worn out its welcome — the movie exhibits precious little humanity."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,30,"It’s not just that Chappie is a mishmash of familiar ingredients whose story quickly slides off the rails into a swamp of action-movie clichés, or another misbegotten project from the Land of Intriguing Premises. It doesn’t have an intriguing premise in the first place. It’s cluttered, goofy and incoherent from beginning to end, and much too long."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,30,"With unappealing one-note characters, retread concepts and implausible motivations, Chappie is a further downward step for director Neill Blomkamp."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,30,"Intelligence, artificial or otherwise, is one of the major casualties of Chappie, a robot-themed action movie that winds up feeling as clunky and confused as the childlike droid with which it shares its name."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,25,An exhausting slog through overly familiar cliches that is nowhere near as profound or touching as it clearly thinks it is and is utterly lacking in the kind of intelligence and artistry that it so often pays lip service to in the dialogue.
Chappie,6.8,31569268,25,"“Short Circuit” meets “RoboCop” — with asides to “WALL-E,” “E.T.,” “The Road Warrior” and many other better movies — in Chappie, an interminable, violent, incoherent and wearying R-rated sci-fi action comedy."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,25,"The film's exasperating atonality washes out any legitimate idea about identity, education, nature versus nurture, or artificial intelligence that Neill Blomkamp hoped to evince."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,25,"Wrongheaded in conception, eye-rolling in execution, Chappie is a childish blend of the cute robot goofiness of “Short Circuit,” and the bloody-minded mayhem of “Robocop.” Neill Blomkamp, the director of “District 9,” has utterly exhausted his supply of South African sci-fi ideas with this disaster, an excruciating two hours of your life you will fear, quite rightly, ever getting back."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,20,Chappie is a movie about the evolution of artificial intelligence that's as dumb as a post. It also marks the continuing devolution of the work of director and co-writer Neill Blomkamp.
Chappie,6.8,31569268,0,A misjudgment from metallic head to titanium toe.
Adrift,6.6,31445012,100,"It’s a true story, basically a two-hander about a pair of courageous lovers lost at sea, as crushingly hard to imagine as it is to watch, but every element is so perfect that it left me shaking and devastated."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,80,"Adrift doesn’t have quite the existential gut-punch of JC Chandor’s similar All Is Lost or the recent Cannes debut  , but what it lacks in the department of pure howling cinema, it makes up for with the emotion of its central relationship."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,75,"What keeps Adrift from feeling like just a travelogue tacked on to a tragi-sploitive star vehicle is, ironically enough, its star. Shailene Woodley has always been great when it comes to bringing the radiance – she's like a sunbeam made sentient – and even better when she can use that California Dreamin' glow semi-subversively a la ""The Spectacular Now"" or ""The Descendents."""
Adrift,6.6,31445012,75,"Director Baltasar Kormákur's film is a simple, acutely observed love story that also happens to be a rousingly stripped-down tale of survival."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,75,"Woodley is a stronger screen presence than the low-key Claflin, but they have a lovely and natural chemistry together."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,75,"Adrift avoids the perils of most survival stories, thanks not only to its strong cast and well-structured script but to Kormákur who manages to succeed at capturing the tone of both the intimate moments and the ones where a building-sized wave looms over Tami and Richard."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,75,"It's not just a story of an incredible feat of survival. It's also a love story, presented with the subtlety of a sledgehammer."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,75,"Although guilty of soft-peddling some harrowing aspects of the experience to achieve the teen-friendly PG-13 rating, Adrift nevertheless gives a flavor of the existential experience inherent in this situation by illustrating that surviving a shipwreck is as much about mental strength as physical endurance and stamina."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,75,It’s all done expertly and with an unexpectedly deft sleight-of-hand twist in the homestretch that proves once again that Kormakur is the kind of overachieving director that one pigeonholes at their own risk. He has a knack for making the familiar feel more surprising than it is.
Adrift,6.6,31445012,70,"Despite predictability, flashback hopping and cheesy lines, Adrift takes viewers on a trip through beautiful cinematography and gut-wrenching performances that are worth seeing."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,70,"Woodley gives herself over to the physical and spiritual reality of each scene. She knows how to play an ordinary woman who’s wild at heart, and she keeps you captivated, even when the film itself is watchable in a perfectly competent, touching, and standard way."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,67,"Given the sweetly dull-witted relationship at its center, Adrift threatens to bog itself down with the endless intercutting back and forth in time. But the movie has a little more up its sleeves, narratively speaking, than first appears, and Kormákur converges the two timelines effectively."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,67,"Adrift is told with an inimitable sense of place and a rare attention to detail, both of which help to ensure that we never lose sight of the terror at hand. When all else fails, which it sometimes does, Woodley is there to right the ship."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,63,It’s great seeing Woodley out of YA sci-fi and into a role that makes use of her approachable reality.
Adrift,6.6,31445012,63,"They never quite got the script right, but director Kormakur toggles well enough. And Woodley sees it through."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,63,"Adrift is paced like its title, and the story’s momentum is slowed somewhat by constant toggling between past and present."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,60,"Adrift is enough of a boilerplate piece of survival drama that you know to expect those beats more or less coming on schedule, but Woodley makes it more emotionally satisfying than it would be otherwise."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,60,"If the part of the film devoted to endurance lacks the harrowing power of, say, 2013's All Is Lost, it at least gives Woodley the opportunity to convincingly sink her teeth into a plum dramatic lead role as a young woman fighting fiercely against the forces of nature (instead of a dystopian civilization)."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,55,There’s a choppiness in the overall dramatic pull that — despite the surface appeal of the stars and Kormákur’s and cinematographer Robert Richardson’s visuals — keeps Adrift from making true waves.
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"What saves Adrift from an instant wreckage is Woodley’s performance, but still, it’s preferable to read the facts than cope with its cinematic adaptation."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"Director Baltasar Kormákur makes good use of location filming on the open waters, giving this melodramatic tale a dose of realism, but this true story is never as harrowing as the subject matter would suggest. Blame it on a misjudged narrative device and Adrift’s generally adolescent approach to relationships and maritime emergencies."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"Woodley and Claflin make an attractive pair, but they’re not particularly convincing playing people deeply, deeply in love. There’s something lacking in the conviction department there."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"What seems at first like an ingenious and surprising dramatic strategy feels, by the end, like an evasion on the movie’s part, a refusal to grant its subject the unflinching honesty it deserves. A true story it may be, but no one should mistake it for a truthful one."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"You can consume only so much gooey romanticism before someone gets seasick, and it’s precisely the soggy love story at the center of Adrift — a survival-at-sea adventure directed by the estimable Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur — that prevents this storm-tossed vehicle from achieving maximum upthrust."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"Like ""Everest,"" Adrift is a movie throbbing with an audience’s anxiety – and yet it is not particularly dramatic."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"Like the peanut butter that serves as a primary source of sustenance in the film, Adrift can be devoured in smooth and/or crunchy modes: high-seas romance or cataclysmic adventure. There are commendable aspects to recommend each approach, yet the final result is an uneasy blend."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"The chronological back-and-forth diffuses the dread and suspense — the feeling of desperate uncertainty implied by the title — that might have made for a more intense, more memorable yarn."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"As he did with his ""Everest"" cast, Kormákur draws a strong, pathos-rich performance from Woodley, filled with moments of her character confronting her own mortality and looking back on safe choices not made. It’s solid drama, but also very slow going."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,40,"Hampered by a script that fails to make the central love affair work and few new ideas while they’re stranded at sea, even the best efforts of its talented lead pair can’t keep this afloat."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,25,"Woodley has been first-rate in everything she’s been in, particularly the “Divergent” series. But there’s something about her performance here that feels like the sincere and dutiful dispersal of medicine."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,25,"There is the potential here for an engaging adventure/survival tale, wrapped in a story of a woman finding her self-confidence by drawing on untapped reserves of strength. But Kormákur fails to find any shape in the narrative of Tami’s actual or psychological journey."
The Core,5.5,31186896,83,The surprise is that it's one of the most exciting and enjoyable disaster epics to come out of Hollywood in some time.
The Core,5.5,31186896,80,It's the feel-good movie of the year.
The Core,5.5,31186896,80,A two-hour pleasure cruise.
The Core,5.5,31186896,75,"The Core is unabashed Hollywood spectacle, but with a cast of up-from-indie actors that makes the cataclysmic kitsch all the more fun to behold."
The Core,5.5,31186896,75,The real core of The Core is the beautiful friendship between a highly emotive Eckhart and the sacrificial Karyo. Their bond is the best thing to happen to Franco-American relations since SpaghettiOs.
The Core,5.5,31186896,75,"It's a straight-ahead adventure with the usual number of thrills, but with the added virtue of being smarter and more sober than one might expect."
The Core,5.5,31186896,70,"Sometimes the laughs here seem unintentional, but most giggles are properly earned, and the movie's fun and exciting if you can accept its inherent camp factor."
The Core,5.5,31186896,70,"With the exception of Hilary Swank, whose earnestness spoils the fun, a stellar cast seems in on the joke."
The Core,5.5,31186896,67,"With a less popcorn-friendly cast and some cheesy special effects, this is a surprisingly engaging, sometimes foolish but often roughly intelligent film."
The Core,5.5,31186896,63,"So howlingly awful that it has unwittingly found a place in that elite group of films that can claim to be ""so bad they're good."""
The Core,5.5,31186896,63,"I have such an unreasonable affection for this movie, indeed, that it is only by slapping myself alongside the head and drinking black coffee that I can restrain myself from recommending it."
The Core,5.5,31186896,63,"No one's going to confuse The Core with art -- or even a good film -- but it's 25 minutes longer than ""The Hours"" and I had at least 25 times as much fun."
The Core,5.5,31186896,60,"More palatable than most pictures of its ilk due to its keen awareness of its own preposterousness, a self-knowledge exuberantly expressed by a mostly live-wire cast."
The Core,5.5,31186896,60,The talented cast--manages to rescue the movie as well as the earth.
The Core,5.5,31186896,60,"The similarities between this film and Michael Bay's overblown ""Armageddon""are too numerous to ignore; the crucial difference is that this one is actually pretty good."
The Core,5.5,31186896,60,Decent in its special effects and has the advantage of having Hilary Swank and Aaron Eckhart in it.
The Core,5.5,31186896,50,"Elaborate misfire, which misuses an unusually good cast."
The Core,5.5,31186896,50,"There's a refreshing surefootedness in the way Amiel, his screenwriters Cooper Layne and John Rogers, and most of his actors recognize how preposterous the idea of traveling to the center of the earth in a souped-up Rototiller really is."
The Core,5.5,31186896,50,The real obstacle here is a lack of filmmaking imagination.
The Core,5.5,31186896,50,"The Core -- with its by-the-numbers plot and performances -- isn't offensive, just unblushingly tacky and derivative."
The Core,5.5,31186896,50,"In dashing Indiana Jones style, Eckhart gets to be a hero."
The Core,5.5,31186896,50,"It's a schlockier ''Armageddon'' crossed with ''Fantastic Voyage,'' minus the fun."
The Core,5.5,31186896,50,"The pacing is brisk-something wacky happens every couple of minutes, the editing crisp and the effects promising. Then disaster strikes: the first act gives way to the relative witlessness of the second and third."
The Core,5.5,31186896,50,"If The Core finally has to be classified as a mess, it is an enjoyable one if you're in a throwback mood. After all, a film that comes up with a rare metal called Unobtainium can't be dismissed out of hand."
The Core,5.5,31186896,40,"It’s just not quite bad enough to be considered good, although Stanley Tucci’s hairpiece comes awfully close."
The Core,5.5,31186896,40,"The first half-hour of The Core is hip enough to its own moribund formula that for a brief, shining moment, there's hope the film will actually be a goofy gas instead of the effects-bound lump it becomes."
The Core,5.5,31186896,38,"I've just seen The Core, and I have a piece of advice for Hilary Swank: Don't quit your night job."
The Core,5.5,31186896,38,"Only Stanley Tucci seems aware of the drop-dead stupidity of the plot, and acts up a storm of high camp as the narcissistic scientist."
The Core,5.5,31186896,30,"This sloppily made, poky, extra cheesy adventure is virtually a remake of ""Armageddon."""
The Core,5.5,31186896,25,The only pressing burden in this deep interior world is the question: What in or on Earth is a cast this good doing in a movie this ridiculous?
The Core,5.5,31186896,10,The cast of The Core deserve Oscar nominations just for being able to speak most of the lines without succumbing to the chortles.
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,67,"Make no mistake, there will be a sequel. Clary may not wind up having the same pop-culture impact as Bella and Katniss, but like it or not, this won't be the last time you hear from her."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,63,Everything chugs along briskly and reasonably entertainingly until running off the rails a bit with a wildly overcomplicated finale.
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,50,"Aside from the giggles induced by the romance-novel bits, the movie's principal hazard is exhaustion. There are too many characters, and too many of them spend too much time morphing into something else. Five more like this? That would be demonic."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,50,"Though imaginatively directed by Harald Zwart, Mortal Instruments, which is adapted from Cassandra Clare's YA novels, is marred by significant flaws."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,50,The movie﻿ blasts by for a while as an odd and busy slice of highly watchable garbage.
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,50,"The storyline is at times muddled and incoherent. This won't bother readers much since they have the ""inside track"" on what's happening. Then again, the narrative is so predictable that maybe it doesn't matter."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,50,"Borrowing every single component of its complicated plot from other sources, The Mortal Instruments is hodgepodge claptrap, but there’s a faint flicker of fun in its introducing-the-world passages."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,50,"Start with a heaping helping of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" Throw in some ""Percy Jackson,"" a dash of ""Twilight,"" a spoonful of ""The Vampire Diaries"" and a sprinkling of ""Harry Potter,"" and you end up with The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,50,"There are elements worth celebrating. The movie is thankfully less self-serious than the mopey “Twilight” films. The Mortal Instruments revels in its own camp.  But there is plenty of room for improvement. The action flick is overly long, complicated and, even by teen romance standards, cringe-worthy in its cheesiness."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,50,"If you love exposition and shapely if bland young actors in leather, skinny jeans, knee boots, Goth cocktail dresses and heavy eye makeup, this may be the movie for you."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"As for some of the big reveals, viewers will see them coming from a galaxy far, far away."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"This initial “Mortal Instruments” picture has the vibe of a straight-to-video release from the mid-‘90s, except with a $60 million budget and considerable special-effects expertise."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"Apparently unable to decide whether to take its own mythology seriously or not, this is a mess of sculpted cheekbones and incoherent romance."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"It’s a potent mix for young fans that gets off to an entertaining, action-packed start with bursts of knowing humour. But it’s soon bogged down by an increasingly convoluted plot, an overindulgent running time and absurd dialogue."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"Despite the overstuffed assortment of vampires, werewolves, warlocks and demons of all shapes and sizes, The Mortal Instruments seldom feels like anything more than a shameless, soulless knockoff."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"A ludicrous, borderline-nonsensical supernatural concoction with a slightly redeeming sense of its own silliness."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"Too much of the film feels like shorthand, a trail of teasing crumbs to lead us to the inevitable sequels."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"There’s so much bouncing around in tone and story that this film never really finds its footing. It flounders around trying to figure out what it should be, and never really settles on anything."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"There’s a germ of something interesting and different within the film’s narrative tangle, but it’s unfortunately been subsumed by Hollywood’s dedication to replicating previous successes."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,38,"That can’t disguise the script’s complete lack of wit or originality, though, or the generally wooden acting."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,38,"Though it has flashes of promise, Bones traces the footsteps of its fantasy film predecessors too closely to blaze anything close to an original narrative."

The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,30,The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is just a sloppy rag bag of ideas cobbled from other stories.
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,30,"The nomenclature varies slightly, but there's little new or exciting in City of Bones. For strong female role models and unique fantasy settings, stick with The Hunger Games."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,25,"These kids have to contrive magical pretexts just to lay hands on each other, and boy, are their excuses rotten."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,25,"No matter how good The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones looks, it's hard to really care about anything that's going on, and not just because we could barely understand it."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,25,"Every moviegoer will have his own breaking point, when The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones surpasses the mundane and enters the ridiculous."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,25,"Within this bloated fantasy hodgepodge, there are few grace notes: In the role of the creepy fortune teller, Madame Dorothea, CCH Pounder is evil fun. And a few special effects, including a Rottweiller who turns into a skinned hellhound, leave an impression. Otherwise, Mortal Instruments manages to occupy 130 minutes of frantic, numbing, activity."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,25,"This is a story that has everything you’re looking for, provided that you’re looking for absolutely nothing."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,25,"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones hopes to be the start of a new franchise for tweens and Twihards, but the twuth is this twash is anything but a twiumph."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,20,This is film-making at its most cynical. But none of it actually makes much sense.
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,20,"This one is by far the worst of the “Twilight” copies. And when that bunch includes “The Host” and “I Am Number Four,” that’s saying something."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,20,The plot is an incomprehensible tangle of dead ends and recaps.
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,20,"If only the fantasy surrounding her made a lick of sense. Here, the Muggle types are known as the “Mundane.” An apt label for a wanna-be franchise with plenty of sheen and nothing to say."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,60,It’s utterly ridiculous – and impossible to resist.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,50,Gods of Egypt is often sloppy and fails in many ways but the cheesy momentum is hard to resist.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,50,"It’s all quest, flash and high action."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,50,"It’s a spectacular mess that’s shameless in its desire to entertain through sheer, misbegotten excess."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,50,"A treasure trove of gilded fantasy bric-a-brac and clashing accents, Proyas’ sword-and-sandals space opera is a head above the likes of Wrath Of The Titans, but it rapidly devolves into a tedious and repetitive succession of monster chases, booby traps, and temples that start to crumble at the last minute."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,50,The alternately cornball and self-aware dialogue and the clearly not state-of-the-art CGI would seeming charmingly retro (like something from a TV miniseries two decades ago) if the movie didn't trot out one epic action film cliche after another.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,42,"While the film becomes a constant test to outdo itself, the raw ambition isn’t nearly enough to make up for the content of the actual film: an ungainly, ugly, nearly interminable monstrosity."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,40,"It’s both thin and overstuffed, filled with intricate, at times dazzling set-pieces peopled by characters we don’t care about, and an irreverent sense of fun that nevertheless leaves us cold. It tries so hard… and ultimately achieves so little."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,40,"If Gods of Egypt were any worse, it might be a masterpiece."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,40,"As audience-friendly as they may be, the cast is left wading through the middle ground between the unengaging narrative and over-emphasised aesthetics."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,38,"There’s a long year ahead of us, but Gods of Egypt is going to stand out as one of the sillier, more puzzling big budget, special-effects driven period pieces to come out."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,33,"Gods of Egypt is a dull, meandering, plastic mess of pre-2002 CGI and performances as flat as the green screens behind them."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,30,"This is by any measure a dreadful movie, a chintzy, CG-encrusted eyesore that oozes stupidity and self-indulgence from every pore. Yet damned if Proyas doesn’t put it all out there with a lunatic conviction you can’t help but admire."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,25,"Like the lobby of a Donald Trump building, it looks ever so expensive and amazingly cheap at the same time."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,25,Imagine the worst costume epic imaginable. Imagine no more. It exists.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,25,Its virtues as throwback don't elide the foolhardly decision to imprint an ancient mythology on a contemporary superhero framework.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,25,"Gods of Egypt might have merited a so-bad-it’s-good schadenfreude fanbase had it maintained the unintentional laughs of its first 10 minutes. Instead, it skids into dullness, thus negating the camp classic that it so often verges on becoming."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,25,A shoddy special-effects howler that makes a hash out of both Egyptian mythology and human logic.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,25,"Call it ""Clash of the Whitans,"" and call it a folly that doesn't have the energy or delirium to qualify as entertaining crap. It's just crap."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,20,"As the film totters to its predictable finale, the closing moments set up a sequel, a prospect far more terrifying than anything we've just seen."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,20,"This overstuffed, witless and bloated stillborn $140 million epic is unlikely to spawn the studio's intended franchise — unless, as is so often the case, international audiences come to the box-office rescue."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,20,Director Alex Proyas’ movie feels like a bad video game.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,0,Avoid it like the plagues.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,0,Some movies are so effing awful they're hilarious. Gods of Egypt falls short of that lofty goal. Not because it isn’t effing awful — it so is — but because it pretends to be in on the joke.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,0,Gods of Egypt is an epic — an epic disaster.
Air America,5.8,31053601,80,Spectacular action sequences and engaging performances by Mel Gibson and Robert Downey Jr make this big-budgeter entertaining and provocative.
Air America,5.8,31053601,63,"While Gibson and Downey work well together, Air America does tend to be slightly overcooked in the cheap laugh department at the expense of a meandering storyline."
Air America,5.8,31053601,60,"Roger Spottiswoode's Air America is partly glorious, partly junk, but unfortunately not in equal parts."
Air America,5.8,31053601,60,"Air America comes on like a noisy, overproduced sitcom pilot."
Air America,5.8,31053601,58,"The movie has no script, and even the better gags - like one in which a couple of the pilots scribble away at coloring books in the backseat of a plane - could have been staged more vividly."
Air America,5.8,31053601,50,The movie that might have been goes down in flames.
Air America,5.8,31053601,50,"This muddled film about a secret C.I.A. project in Laos in 1969 fails on every possible level: as action film, as buddy film, as scenic travelogue and even, sad to say, as a way to flaunt Mel Gibson's appeal."
Conan the Destroyer,5.9,31042035,75,"Conan the Destroyer is more cheerful than the first Conan movie, and it probably has more sustained action, including a good sequence in the glass palace."
Conan the Destroyer,5.9,31042035,70,"A predictable quest plot is unwound with tremendous verve, and the only real disappointments are some ropey special effects. But Fleischer's zest for action carries it all along splendidly."
Conan the Destroyer,5.9,31042035,70,"Conan the Destroyer is the ideal sword and sorcery picture. As Conan, Arnold Schwarzenegger seems more animated and much funnier under Fleischer’s direction than he did under John Milius’ in the original – he even has an amusing drunk scene. Jones just about runs off with the picture."
Conan the Destroyer,5.9,31042035,63,"Conan the Destroyer is not an awful follow-up, just a mostly unnecessary one."
Conan the Destroyer,5.9,31042035,60,"Under the direction of veteran Fleischer, this superior sequel to the plodding Conan The Barbarian boasts much more speed, skill, and ingenuity than its predecessor."
Conan the Destroyer,5.9,31042035,60,"Destroyer makes all the mistakes Barbarian avoided. Dropping the first movie’s grim approach to achieve an audience-friendly rating, the sequel goes for a lighter, more overtly humorous tone, with multiple characters serving as increasingly unnecessary comic relief."
Conan the Destroyer,5.9,31042035,58,"The special effects aren't bad, and there are fewer decapitations than in Conan the Barbarian. Mr. Fleischer seems to want this film to be funnier than was the first one, directed by John Milius, but Mr. Schwarzenegger, a body builder who can lift freight trains, can't easily get his tongue into his cheek."
Conan the Destroyer,5.9,31042035,50,"Arnie still swings that sword with aplomb, but with a story this ludicrous, he's on slippery ground."
Dune,6.6,30925690,90,"While it's hardly a cohesive experience, individual scenes are brought to life with striking power."
Dune,6.6,30925690,75,"For all its cumbersome scope (realized on a shimmeringly large scale by Lawrence of Arabia cinematographer Freddie Francis), the film remains an intensely personal epic, Lynch's uncommon emphasis on characters rather than effects lending his exposition a rather remarkable lucidity."
Dune,6.6,30925690,70,"Lynch's third feature may have been a commercial disaster, but it gets under your skin and is marked by unforgettable images and an extraordinary soundtrack."
Dune,6.6,30925690,70,A most fascinating disaster of genre making.
Dune,6.6,30925690,60,"Dune is a huge, hollow, imaginative and cold sci-fi epic. Visually unique and teeming with incident, David Lynch's film holds the interest due to its abundant surface attractions but won't, of its own accord, create the sort of fanaticism which has made Frank Herbert's 1965 novel one of the all-time favorites in its genre."
Dune,6.6,30925690,60,"DUNE is visually delightful but choppy, confusing, and overloaded with exposition. Moreover, most of the thematic material that made the novel work--subtexts involving incestuous desire, capitalism vs. environmentalism, and Middle East politics--is simply missing."
Dune,6.6,30925690,50,"How maddening Dune is! As you would expect from visionary director David Lynch, it is a movie of often staggering visual power, the most ambitious science fiction film since ""2001""; it's also stupefyingly dull and disorderly. Dune doesn't get going till fully two hours have elapsed, so only the most patient will wait for the images to build to their crescendo. Lax in its storytelling, Dune gives us sublimity unmoored."
Dune,6.6,30925690,50,"The problem is that the imagery—as Sadean as Pasolini's Salo—isn't rooted in any story impulse, and so its power dissipates quickly. The real venue for this film is either a grind house or the Whitney Museum."
Dune,6.6,30925690,50,"So inward and remote does the movie seem, it might have arrived in a time capsule from one of the four warring planets. Most sci-fi movies offer escape, a holiday from homework, but Dune is as difficult as a final exam. You have to cram for it."
Dune,6.6,30925690,40,"SEVERAL of the characters in Dune are psychic, which puts them in the unique position of being able to understand what goes on in the movie."
Dune,6.6,30925690,40,"This movie is a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion into the murkier realms of one of the most confusing screenplays of all time."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,70,"Robin Hood is no classic, but if it sometimes seems like it’s trying to be “Baz Luhrmann’s Robin Hood,” more power to it. The movie is a diverting live-wire lark — one that, for my money, gets closer to the spirit of what Robin Hood is about than the logy 1991 Kevin Costner version or the dismal 2010 Russell Crowe version."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,63,"While it plays fast and loose with loaded political iconography, this Robin Hood brings a whole new dimension to this age-old tale."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,63,"Robin Hood’s shameless silliness only takes it so far, as the film is frequently undermined by Otto Bathurst’s wobbly direction."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,"You could build a suspension bridge over the gap between what Robin Hood could have been and what it is. Its hero is credible as a man who wants to rob from the rich and give to the poor, but the storytelling is so impoverished that the message can't stick."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,"Well, the Hood would never stand for it and neither should you. Defy authority and watch this movie on a plane instead."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,Say this and little else for the new Robin Hood movie: It’s less of a self-serious slog than the last Robin Hood movie.
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,The action is violent and improbable but not staged with particular pizazz.
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,Some of the film is slow. Some of it is silly.
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,"Grimly upbeat rather than merry, and relentless rather than frenetic, the film’s gritty zest is splashed across the screen with momentum, but also to the point of overuse. It serves a late heist set piece well, yet wears thin in a sea of training, thieving and fighting montages elsewhere."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,"On all fronts, it strives to twist the Robin Hood story into something more provocative, but ultimately it’s a garbled, hollow mess of attempts at relevancy."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,45,"It’s a straightforward retelling with a confusing design philosophy, disappointing action sequences, weak storytelling and a cast which clearly deserved better material."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,42,"Rife with stereotypes, a terrible script, and odd “300”-esque cinematography that just doesn’t fit, this is not only a film nobody asked for, but also one that nobody should be forced to endure."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,40,"It’s a world that is so incoherent and inconsistent you almost have to admire the chutzpah, in which buxom lady horse-thieves dress themselves for a night of crime displaying several inches of showy cleavage, contained only by a glorified shoelace."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,40,This version will make you side with the Sheriff of Nottingham.
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,40,"Like Guy Ritchie’s King Arthur, this tries hard to do something new and exciting with an old formula. It quickly makes you wish for something more traditional and straightforward."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,40,"This bloated, featureless, CGI-heavy movie is not so much stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, as stealing from Guy Ritchie, Batman, Two-Face and a few others – and not giving back all that much to the audience."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,30,"Robin Hood isn’t as awful as all that, really. For one thing, it’s too singularly bizarre to be anything less than head scratchingly entertaining, and the action set-pieces are pulled off with much quivery panache."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,30,"The plot is twisty in a perfunctory way, the action predictably explosive, the sought-after exhilaration nonexistent."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,Egerton is miscast. He and Hewson have nary a spark in their love scenes. Dornan overplays his hand. Foxx belts out nearly every line as if he’s trying to be heard above a parade of fire engines on a Fourth of July parade
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,"What balderdash. And not the fun kind, either."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,"There’s nothing particularly memorable about Robin Hood even when you’re laughing at it, and that may be one of the saddest fates a movie can meet."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,"The more invested you are in the old-fashioned Robin Hood of legend — the less likely you are to enjoy what amounts to a chilly and flavorless frappé of historical speculation, revisionist folklore and every lazy action-movie cliche ever written."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,"The latest labored take on the old British legend, Robin Hood is little more than a pitch-black war film, complete with rudimentary medieval bombs and blood spatter on the camera lens."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,"If nothing else, this accidentally hilarious, goofy train wreck of an origin story most definitely has the courage of its convictions. Alas, the film isn’t smart enough to recognize that its convictions are dumb, and it doesn’t have the goods to back them up in the first place."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,20,"This film, with its endless copying of Assassin’s Creed camera angles and state-of-the-art bullseyes, is an ugly machine, tiring to the eye, monotonously scored, and also weirdly regressive on quite a few levels."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,20,"Arriving just in time to win a place among the year’s worst films, Robin Hood — bursting with an entitled sense of its own non-existent coolness — falls flat on its fat one."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,20,A thoroughly incoherent movie salad.
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,20,"Mendelsohn's villain is boringly one-note, Eve Hewson's Marion uses an incongruous Yank accent and always looks as though she's just stepped out of the makeup trailer, F. Murray Abraham swans around in fancy cardinal's vestments looking sinister and Foxx seems pissed off that he's not somewhere, perhaps anywhere, else. As for Egerton, he's a boy doing a man's job."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,80,More story-led than the original with a high enough body count to make it a satisfying action movie.
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,75,"Beautifully outfitted and moodily photographed, the movie is directed by Stephen Hopkins, the Jamaican-born Australian responsible for Nightmare on Elm Street V. He keeps the pedal to the metal but never allows the explosive action to minimize his actors."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,75,"Virtually everything about the film is derivative--even the design for the eerie setting for the climactic struggle recalls the interiors of the more exotic old movie palaces--but its makers can't be accused of cutting corners. No doubt about it, those who ask only for pure action will be getting their money's worth."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,63,"The film's energy and style are enough to recommend it. Lovers of the original should be pleased with this effort, as should most fans of the genre."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,60,"While the film doesn’t achieve the same thrills of the final 45 minutes of Predator in terms of overall excitement, it outdoes its first safari in start-to-finish hysteria. The real star is the pic’s design. Writers don’t waste much time on character development."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,60,"Since the predator is imaginary but the people who made this film are not, Predator 2 speaks sadly of their own lack of curiosity and imagination."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,60,"There is so much violence, as gangs kill gangs, or gangs kill cops, or the predator kills all of them, that it's hard to watch without the brain succumbing to self-protective numbness."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,50,"It's shoot-em-up action from start to finish, beginning at such a peak that there's hardly any room for the action to build or climax."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,50,"There are a couple of entertaining action sequences, including the climactic battle between the cop and the Predator. The special effects, all shot on film, and the makeup effects, are top-notch for the time they appeared, so as a historical record the movie is interesting. But it just doesn't have enough meat to sate a hungry hunter."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,50,"The whole noisy movie is really just a setup for the climactic duel between renegade cop Danny Glover and the monster. By that point, you’re pathetically grateful for a few stomach-churning special effects."

The Art of War,5.7,30208599,42,"Slick, noisy thriller."
The Art of War,5.7,30208599,40,"A hackneyed movie of zero social, political or dramatic consequence."

Bad Company,5.6,30160161,80,"Deft, funny and intelligently scary."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,67,"Joel Schumacher directs with far less fetishism than he might have, while producer Jerry Bruckheimer kicks up only a fraction of the bull dust usually visible in his projects."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,63,"There is much more suspense in this sequence than a similar scene in last week's ""The Sum of All Fears"" -- which wasn't intended to be funny."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,60,"Hopkins and Rock are a surprisingly good mix; Hopkins actually underplays his role as a company man with a barely acknowledged conscience, while Rock's manic impulses aren't allowed to run riot."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,60,"Anthony Hopkins, with a toothpick and a slouch. Fabulous!"
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,60,It's almost impossible to enjoy this uneven but mostly exciting popcorn pic without flinching at a few plot elements that feel a bit too real for comfort.
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,60,"From the plotting and the characterizations to the explosions and excessive use of blue light filters, everything about Bad Company has been done and seen before."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,50,"Bad Company would just be another silly, intermittently funny, buddy comedy (Anthony Hopkins is Rock's training agent) were it not for a plot unlaughably close to current events."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,50,"As in all Jerry Bruckheimer-produced summer blockbusters, the premise is paper-thin and the action sequences play out with assembly-line regularity."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,50,"Company almost seems like the product of a post-Sept. 11 world. Like a cartoon version of a real threat, the villains are terrorists of a non-specific nationality with an ill-defined anti-American agenda and a tendency to spout complaints too clichéd to take seriously."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,50,"I won't tell you I didn't enjoy parts of Bad Company, because I did. But the enjoyment came at moments well-separated by autopilot action scenes and stunt sequences that outlived their interest."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,50,"Feels stale, bloated and willing to get by on sheer familiarity."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,50,"It's fast, snappy and entertaining in a superficial way. But it lacks gravity and authenticity and seems more like a product than an attempt to tell a story."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,50,"It's fun to watch for a while. But the movie runs much too long, and a few funny bits aside, most of the comedy writing is lame."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,50,"Though they're a good pair (Hopkins and Rock), this isn't a very good movie. It's slick but hollow."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,42,"Watching Rocks shows, we know he's sharper than the average actor. But watching him flail and play funny in movies that aren't as smart as him is simply depressing. Someone give this man a good role. And please, let him do a few more takes -- these scenes can't be his best efforts."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,40,"Whether you care if they find them (terrorists) or not may depend on how much you've been able to withstand Bad Company's sensory overload of firefights, vehicular mayhem, techno-cool swagger and enough bumptious contrivances to fill several seasons of daffy prime-time soaps."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,40,"Some of this stuff is uncomfortably close to minstrelsy. Bad Company closes on a patriotic note in a brief scene that pays heartfelt tribute to the terrorist-thwarting sacrifices of the CIA. Timing is everything, I guess."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,40,"The motor of the plot, involving nuclear terrorism, not only knocked Bad Company out of last year's release schedule due to 9/11 sensitivity, it stops Rock and Hopkins from sustaining a comic rapport. The waste is criminal."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,38,Schumacher doesn't leave an imprint on the film -- it could be the work of any second-rate director.
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,38,"Leaves a bad taste, not only because of its bad-luck timing, but also the staleness of its script."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,38,"A longwinded, predictable scenario."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,30,Lacks the bite that can equal the Bruckheimer bark.
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,30,"The picture lasts 111 minutes, partly because of numerous false endings. Now, that constitutes cruel and unusual punishment."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,25,"The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher, and reflects the worst of their shallow styles: wildly overproduced, inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one (and no one)."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,25,"A Jerry Bruckheimer production, which gives the movie a disquieting sense of stupidity."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,25,"Like many of the nonpolitical terrorist-as-villain spectaculars that have been held back after Sept. 11, has the whiff of something gone stale. Though it may have sat on the shelf for a while, this project had gone bad long before it was released."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,25,"This cookie-cutter spy thriller depends on the chemistry between Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock. Um, wait, there isn't any."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,20,"Predictably soulless techno-tripe, this Bruckheimer-in-a-can thriller is leavened only by the ludicrous notion of Chris Rock playing separated twins."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,20,The major problem with this alleged comic thriller is it is neither funny nor thrilling. Neither the heavies nor the good guys are believable.
Road House,6.6,30050028,80,"An immensely enjoyable slice of romanticised fisticuffs, this is a Western in every respect except the stetsons and six guns."
Road House,6.6,30050028,80,"Swayze gives up 'Dirty Dancing' for dirty fighting in this violent, spectacular and immensely enjoyable study of Zen and the art of Barroom Bouncing...Mindless entertainment of the highest order."
Road House,6.6,30050028,63,"Road House exists right on the edge between the ""good-bad movie"" and the merely bad. I hesitate to recommend it, because so much depends on the ironic vision of the viewer. This is not a good movie. But viewed in the right frame of mind, it is not a boring one, either."
Road House,6.6,30050028,50,Road House is startling because of the intensity of its violence and because of Swayze`s mindless posturing. A young star has sold himself to become a pinup boy.
Road House,6.6,30050028,50,The film gets campier by the minute.
Road House,6.6,30050028,40,"Director Rowdy Herrington lives up to his name: once he's seen to it that all the conventions of the western are in place, he presents an all-out brawl on the average of about every 12 minutes or so, and the battles quickly grow tiresome. Swayze is up to a part that requires him merely to show his muscles and dexterity, but Gazzara is trapped in his hopelessly evil caricature, leaving Sam Elliott (in a too-limited role) to provide the film's only real charm."
Road House,6.6,30050028,40,"With Road House, United Artists hotwires Patrick Swayze a star vehicle shackled by a couple of flat tires in the script department. Ill-conceived and unevenly executed, pic essentially is a Western - a loner comes in to clean up a bar, of all things, and ends up washing and drying the whole town - but its vigilante justice, lawlessness and wanton violence feel ludicrous in a modern setting."
Road House,6.6,30050028,38,"An ugly commingling of old Westerns, Zen chic and kung fu movies...Full of gratuitous mayhem, head-bashing, gay-bashing and woman-bashing, Road House has a malicious, almost putrid tone."
Road House,6.6,30050028,38,"In Road House, Patrick Swayze has the most laughable role since Tom Cruise juggled a few liquor bottles and danced to ''The Hippy Hippy Shakes'' in Cocktail...Next to Dalton, Johnny Castle in Dirty Dancing seems like Hamlet. Mr. Swayze does some dirty fighting here, but mostly the role requires a blank expression. At this point, Road House makes his career look like a bad joke."
Tora! Tora! Tora!,7.5,29548291,88,"It's rare for a feature film to attain the trifecta of entertaining, informing, and educating."
Tora! Tora! Tora!,7.5,29548291,80,"Watching real planes crashing into real planes on a runway is flatout exciting, and the bombing sequence here is easily the equal of anything that Michael Bay could do."
Tora! Tora! Tora!,7.5,29548291,67,"The careful balancing of the two sides produces its own interesting effect, however, showing how war goes from possible to inevitable, whatever the wishes on either side. Had Tora! Tora! Tora! taken the notion a bit further, it might have created a portrait of escalating tension chilling enough to rival its carefully orchestrated climactic bombing raid."
Tora! Tora! Tora!,7.5,29548291,60,"There's something of a soft shoe shuffle to avoid treading on national sensibilities. But the climax, in particular, manages to be more than just a shoot-out, with Fleischer's intelligent direction generating a real feeling of chaos and apocalypse."
Tora! Tora! Tora!,7.5,29548291,50,"The Japanese sneak attack that plunged the US into WW II is lavishly and fairly accurately, if not enthrallingly, brought to the screen in this Japanese-US coproduction."
Tora! Tora! Tora!,7.5,29548291,40,"From the moment you read the ads for Tora! Tora! Tora! (""The Most Spectacular Film Ever Made!”), you are aware that you're in the presence of a film possessed by a lack of imagination so singular that it amounts to a death wish."
Tora! Tora! Tora!,7.5,29548291,40,"Both overall director Richard Fleischer and his Japanese counterparts do a dull job, and the monotonously low-key tone of scene after scene almost suggests that each was filmed without a sense of ultimate slotting in the finished form."
Tora! Tora! Tora!,7.5,29548291,25,"Tora! Tora! Tora! is one of the deadest, dullest blockbusters ever made."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,91,Zathura is a rarity: a stellar fantasy that faces down childhood anxieties with feet-on-the-ground maturity.
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,90,"The result is a glorious low-tech pleasure that may be the most lyrical, phantasmagoric boys' adventure story since Joe Dante's Explorers."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,88,A wild buckle-up-and-blast-off adventure that plunges every corner of kids' favorite subject.
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,83,Cool!
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,83,"Although the drama suffers from the episodic story structure, Zathura feels less like ""Jumanji"" and more like a really great episode of Steven Spielberg's ""Amazing Stories"" TV series."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,78,Favreau keeps the picture throttling forward with a carefree charm.
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,75,"Will work better for younger viewers than older ones. There's not much plot to absorb and there's plenty of action, so this is the kind of spectacle that will appeal to those without long attention spans."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,75,It works gloriously as space opera.
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,75,The result is an odd mix of honesty and hokum that pilots a course toward greatness before settling into a somewhat lower orbit.
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,75,"Jon Favreau, the actor-director who made the delightful family film ""Elf,"" has a firm grip and a light touch with this material about bickering brothers who find a board game that zaps the family home into hyperspace."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,75,Jonah Bobo and Josh Hutcherson -- may have delivered their parts just a wee too convincingly. Their squabbling is so pitch perfect that most adult viewers likely will want to reach through the screen and start crackin' some heads.
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,75,The movie harks back to a time before state-of-the-art technology when writers and directors had to rely mostly on imagination.
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,75,"Zathura involves a lot of yelling, a lot of explosions and a lot of flying objects -- but what else would you expect from a movie that is, honestly for a change, intended for 10-year-old boys?"
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,70,Favreau again delivers that rare beast -- a family film that even childless adults can enjoy.
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,70,"Its unwieldy title notwithstanding, Zathura: A Space Adventure is arguably the best adaptation of a Chris Van Allsburg book to date."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,70,"Neither pandering nor dull, Zathura plays exactly like a no-limits replica of the kind of space adventure that imaginative kids left to their own devices might enact."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,70,"This handmade feel gives Zathura an appealing, childlike sense of wonder, an element too often forgotten in movies with many times the budget and technological resources."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,70,"In the enchanted limbo between waking and sleeping, Zathura feels both real and unreal, like a dream you could shake off at any moment."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,70,"Flawless comic timing and vivid imagination power this rollicking sequel to ""Jumanji."""
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,70,"A low-key, warm-without-being-schmaltzy childhood adventure story that will engage younger viewers without driving their parents too crazy."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,63,"Jon Favreau's adaptation of Chris Van Allsburg's kid-lit adventure of the same name, more than fills the bill - though it's unlikely to draw anyone over the age of 11 (not counting baby-sitters)."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,63,"There's nary a smidgen of adult humor, so parents might find things a bit on the dull side at times, but in the end they will likely thank Favreau in droves for making a film that is at least certain not to give them a headache."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,60,"Director Jon Favreau, who dipped profitably into family entertainment with 2003's ""Elf,"" effectively recreates the illustrative universe of a good children's book, but he's stuck with a story that noisily grinds its gears."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,60,"The movie has a lot of the elements that might make it thrilling and it's visually arresting, but it's missing the emotional connection necessary to make it interesting."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,50,"One thing: Perhaps my studio-cynic hackles are raised imprudently, but either Favreau reimagined the boys' teenage sister to read as matinee sex bomb, Tootsie Rolling around in pink boxers for half the film, or children's books have become a lot hotter since I put down Seuss and Sendak for Encyclopedia Brown."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,50,"It's a tick better than the movie version of ""Jumanji,"" if that's any help. If you liked the book, you'll find the film of ""Zathura"" faithful in most respects, though not so much amplified as padded."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,50,"Tim Robbins plays the working dad, and the movie misses him once he bails out early."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,50,"Basically ""Jumanji"" in outer space -- and even without Robin Williams, this is still a singularly loud, charmless and overbearing family movie that could use a hit or two of Ritalin."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,50,"The film's Buck Rogers-style graphics are cool, but the shrilly squabbling brothers -- realistic though they may be -- are insufferable, the story's your-turn/my-turn structure is tedious, and its relentlessly reiterated message about brotherly love and cooperation is really grating."
Zathura: A Space Adventure,6.2,29258869,38,Rarely is a movie audience asked to put up with so much noise for such a thankless payoff.
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,80,"Feels fresh and satisfying. Maybe it's the presence of Jason Statham, the British action star who has a physicality like no other actor out there right now."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,75,"Like the original, it is a moody, atmospheric film, one boasting significantly more depth than your typical blow-'em-up."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,75,"Short, fast and nasty, The Mechanic is considerably more fun than the rather lethargic original."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,75,"To the extent that it's original, The Mechanic is insane, bordering on gloriously insane."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,75,"Couple that with actual acting-Statham is the most winning action hero around, and Foster brings some nuance that the script probably doesn't deserve-and it's bloody fun."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,70,"Quick, capable, thoroughly bloody action film."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,70,"The action is entertaining enough, and it's kind of fun to follow the intricate plotting and planning of the jobs."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,67,Improves on the original in at least one key way: Its lead characters appear to have souls.
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,65,"Mostly, The Mechanic creaks and groans as it goes through the motions, and not even its lavish violence - which includes much smashing of heads and a nasty screwdriver stabbing - is particularly electrifying."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,63,"Despite a certain emotional chill, what holds this Mechanic together is - no surprise - the core Carlino story."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,63,"Brisk, brutal and unconcerned with collateral damage, The Mechanic doesn't pave much of anything new in the assassin-for-hire genre. But when it kills, it does so with style."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,63,"Adequate light entertainment for those who enjoy thrillers, but it is uneven and the underwhelming ending will disappoint those who enjoyed the delicious irony served up by its predecessor."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,60,The movie is crisp and contemporary enough to inaugurate another franchise for Statham.
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,60,"Jason Statham bares his six-pack before speaking his first line in this humorless, efficient remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson hitman movie."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,60,"Better than ""The Transporter"" but not as much fun as ""Crank""."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,50,The result is just good enough to pass as an action flick you watch with the forgiving gaze that comes from too many beers and too little sleep.
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,50,"Has a deliberately minimalist, retro look to it as well."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,50,"An intermittently arresting, mostly standard action entry that deals death noisily more than cleverly - a lot like the original."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,50,"It'd be nice if Jason Statham and Ben Foster, The Mechanic's mentor/protege duo, could crack a smile. Once."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,50,The Mechanic remains singularly uninvolving - a rote exercise in a genre with characters so familiar they barely register.
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,50,"An intriguing plot is established, a new character is brought on with a complex set of problems, and then all the groundwork disintegrates into the usual hash of preposterous action sequences."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,50,"As it is, The Mechanic is ham-fisted pulp, like Robert Rodriguez's ""Machete"" taking itself seriously."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,50,"Like many action stars, Statham is good at cool brooding, but West's frantic style works against this."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,50,"The Mechanic runs on violence, and when no one's being riddled with bullets or getting their hand shoved into a garbage disposal, it lags. That said, the ""action"" sequences are so frequent and bloody that they render plot nearly obsolete."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,50,"In essence, this one is the equivalent of the ""B"" movies that flourished during the original's era -- and it proves middling, and occasionally muddled, on almost every level."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,40,"The only bit of machinery that makes the film move is Jason Statham, who's provided the steely saving grace in so many modern action movies."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,40,"There's some limited entertainment to be found in a movie as insistently conflicted as The Mechanic, but the accretion of sadism, humorlessness and antediluvian sexual politics is finally more exhausting than enlivening."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,40,It's so played out at this point that not even the enjoyably no-nonsense Statham can pump any life into it.
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,40,"The new film could have benefited from even a moment of genuine reflection. Being a mechanic seems like a thinking man's occupation. The Mechanic, though, barely has a thought in its head."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,40,"It's a pleasure to watch the granite-faced action star do his own stunts, particularly a death-defying leap from a bridge. Yet everything feels hurried."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,38,It's a modestly effective but jaw-droppingly violent picture.
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,30,"Mr. Statham, the specialist in English tough guys who was so affecting in ""The Bank Job,"" has more to offer than The Mechanic has the grace to receive."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,30,"West (Con Air) saturates his imagery in a sickly, sulphurous stew of rotten-egg yellows and oranges, making a mediocre picture downright repellent at times."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,25,"Even by the sloppy, soulless standards of hit man movies, The Mechanic is a mess."
The Mechanic,6.6,29121498,25,What's remarkable about the remake is its nastiness.
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,63,"A lively, good-looking kiddie action comedy best left to those under 10. Although their attention may wander, parents can be grateful that there's some substance as well as fun in this Disney release, for martial arts is presented as a matter of defense rather than aggression, emphasizing that it is a matter of mind and spirit as well as body and requiring resourcefulness and discipline."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,63,"While one could wish the film offered something more original than its strictly formula heroics, it benefits from a generous portion of charm. And most kids attending 3 Ninjas are likely to stand up and cheer the rousing, action-packed finale."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,60,"Brazenly exploitative stuff, stirring in anything which has done the business in kids' movies previously, this, of course, should have its target audience laughing like drains."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,60,"The film can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to be a comedy, a fantasy or an adventure film. Mr. Kingsley's villain gnashes his teeth and snorts, I love being the bad guy. Those who displease him are threatened with the tearing out of a heart or liver. The character ends up being neither scary nor funny, while the boys are so busy demonstrating their superhuman skills that no personalities emerge."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,50,"Can the trio use their ninja secrets to escape? Will granddad defeat the gun-runner in hand-to-hand combat? If you can't guess the answers to these questions you are under 11 and will absolutely love this film, with its amazing fight scenes, bungling Home Alone kidnappers and thoroughly nasty bad guys. Send mum and dad shopping."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,50,"3 Ninjas is basically harmless, but it's not entertaining enough to fully engage adults or the under-12 set -- especially once the popcorn and sodas have been polished-off."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,40,A miserable ripoff of The Karate Kid with three whitebread young-uns taking lessons from their Chinese grandfather on how to be upright and horizontal ninja warriors. They get their kicks trying to knock off a Steven Seagal imitation who is running drugs.
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,40,"The director, Jon Turtletaub, completely misses the character-driven appeal of the Karate Kid series, and there's no Macauley Culkin in this cast. The movie is saddled with a junky visual style, haphazard editing and occasional out-of-focus shots. Much of it looks like very bad television, although the toilet jokes and a running gag about laxatives and instant diarrhea may be a little raw for the Disney Channel."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,40,"3 Ninjas, Touchstone Pictures' latest attempt to fill the idle summer hours of our nation's youth, is a Frankenstein of a movie, an unhappy creature stitched together out of the body parts of other movies. And though it's not a horror film, it is a genuinely scary experience, if only because it actually seems to make time stand dead still."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,30,"Even in this conglomerate era of marketed, predigested mediocrity, this Disney movie slips instantly into the humdrum."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,70,The film delivers almost exactly what fans of the first installment are hoping for.
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,70,"The most welcome change is the tone. Wadlow has decided he's making a straight-up comedy, and he demonstrates a knack for it."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,67,"It's rambunctiously amusing but the laughs clot in your throat. There's a meaner streak this time to Kick-Ass and Hit Girl's exploits, or maybe Carrey's sensitivity is justified. Either way, the third act of Kick-Ass 2 is a visceral beatdown."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,63,"I do get a chuckle out of movies with wildly inappropriate behavior, rude language and ultramayhem, especially when they involve children, but Kick-Ass 2 sometimes felt like being trapped in a room with the funniest guy in seventh grade."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,63,Tone isn't the movie's sole problem. There's something off-putting about Christopher Mitz-Plasse as the chief bad guy.
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,60,"Kick-Ass 2, a movie that, for all its predictable sequel-ness, manages to conjure up pretty much the same dark magic that the earlier film did, albeit with more troubling results. Believe it or not, Kick-Ass 2 is even more of a provocation than the first Kick-Ass."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,60,"As diverting as this action-packed caper often is, it feels not just weightless but emotionally and morally stunted whenever it veers into grown-up dramatic territory."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,60,"A more modest success than the first ""Kick-Ass,"" but still of-a-piece with its scurrilous predecessor. Nobody flies a jet-pack up a skyscraper this time, but Kick-Ass 2 still has its share of over-the-top action, and the sweary laughs are just about intact."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,60,"A fun if sporadically schizoid return to one of the brighter, brasher comic-bookers of recent years."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,60,"The best thing about ‘Kick-Ass’ was Moretz, and Hit-Girl still gets the best lines. Like the first film, Kick-Ass 2 pulls the reality of teen life into its fantasy."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,56,Faithful to the superficial thrills and flaws of the original.
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"Moretz, who is 16 now, can't manufacture the same that's-so-wrong jolt she managed the first time around. Back then, it was hilariously taboo to see a little girl spout arias of profanity. Now, she's just another teenager swearing. Like the rest of the film, what was once shocking now just elicits a shrug."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"Like its own protagonists, Kick-Ass 2 can’t decide what it wants to be when it grows up: a vessel for unhinged vengeance and destruction or a meta-critique of those same impulses. In going for both, it winds up being neither."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"Kick-Ass 2 has a mean-spirited vigilante streak the first film lacked (it seemed more concerned with justice, in its way), as well as a fatigue. It’s still funny, particularly when Hit Girl spews profanity and wields weapons. It’s just not as good."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"A weird mix of the refreshing and the dispiriting, Kick-Ass 2 is appealing in its brutal honesty and repellent in its honest brutality."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"To stand out in a crowded marketplace, a sequel can’t just kick ass — it has to blow minds."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,What seemed edgy and brash in Kick-Ass is now routine and old-hat. The first movie was a brash satire on formulaic comic-book movies — exactly the sort of picture the sequel turns out to be.
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"Even with its edges sanded down, Kick-Ass 2 is unmistakably Millaresque — a juvenile comedy of excess, in which skewering adolescent power fantasies looks an awful lot like indulging in them."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"Kick-Ass 2 returns with the original’s rollicking sense of vulgarity and bodily trauma fully intact, but the story has more plot lines to string together than absolutely necessary."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"Kick-Ass 2 is a lesser version of what it appears to be, an uncertain jumble rather than a true exploration of outrage, violence and identity."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"The crime isn’t that Kick-Ass 2 is vulgar (which it is), but that it’s for so little gain."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"That makes Kick Ass 2 more sour than sweet, a movie that jokes about comic book fanboys but stops short of mocking them the way the first film did."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,40,The meta-satire hits you over the head until not just your Spidey sense is tingling.
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,40,"A messy, confused, over-the-top mixture of brutality and sick comedy, puckishness and ugliness, self-awareness and tone-deafness."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,40,"Your ass is constantly braced in readiness and hope, but it remains un-kicked."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,38,"Kick-Ass 2 is an uninspired retread. All too often it plays like a Comic-Con gone insane, with costumed do-gooders taking on costumed criminals in gratuitously vicious battles."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,38,"Kick-Ass is a prime example of a movie that never should have bothered with a sequel. Not only is its successor played-out, but it revels in carnage while lacking the visual style and gleeful humor of the original."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,38,"In the annals of sequeldom, Kick-Ass 2 has to be one of the lamest follow-ups ever."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,38,"It's no better, no worse and essentially no different from the jocular, clodhopping brutality of the first one."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,25,Kick-Ass 2 is a special kind of crap: the kind smart people make for audiences they think are stupid.
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,25,"If it works at all, fitfully, it's because of the precociously talented and in-control Moretz, who carries the film on her own small shoulders."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,25,"The film doubles down on the love-hate relationship with ultra-violence that typified its predecessor, but A History of Violence this is not."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,12,"Arriving at the tail end of blockbuster season, this cheaply produced sequel to the surprise 2011 hit arrives in plenty of time to claim the title of the year’s most unpleasant movie."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,10,"The writer and director, Jeff Wadlow, can’t obscure the movie’s misogyny, and he also has a tough time staging a scene and selling a joke. His worst offense is that he has no understanding of the power, gravity and terrible beauty of violent imagery, which means he has no grasp of cinema."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,0,One of the year's worst films.
Point Break,5.3,28782481,63,"In its philosophical and criminal investigations (largely imported from Kathryn Bigelow's original), the film moves in dozens of illogical directions, but not without achieving a patina of earnest credibility."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,63,"For all the adrenalizing positives in this reworked Point Break, inadvertent silliness remains"
Point Break,5.3,28782481,50,"Nowhere does Mr. Core’s film approach the action-movie chops or psychological smarts of Ms. Bigelow’s original or, truth be told, benefit from actors displaying the same charm as her stars. But for a number of liberating airborne seconds, none of that may matter."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,50,"Unless you’re a fan of extreme sports photography, the 2015 Point Break lags behind its predecessor in most areas."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,50,"“Bodhi,” in Sanskrit, is short for “being of wisdom.” In Hawaii, “Keanu” means “cool mountain breeze.” And, in Hollywood, Point Break means never having to bother with a plausible plot."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,50,"Ericson Core’s Point Break strips the silly fun and relatively straight-ahead narrative from the original for a humorless, if photogenic spin on extreme crime."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,40,"A joyless and pointless remake. The new take on Bodhi and co. squanders a potentially enjoyable premise and rarely delivers, except on the occasional stunt."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,40,"Core’s incarnation of Point Break is about one thing, extreme sports, and it is no small relief that the film at least handles those sequences well."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,40,The sense of living dangerously is somewhat lacking as Kurt Wimmer’s emotionally vacant screenplay fails to make audiences care enough about the characters to sweat over their physical exertions.
Point Break,5.3,28782481,38,"The fact that Bracey is the equivalent of a charisma black hole (at the movie’s center, there is no there there) and the further fact that the movie runs out of plot long before it runs out of stunts to showcase, make Point Break a remake that ought not to have been made."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,38,"The idea of remaking ""Point Break"" was not necessarily a bad idea, I suppose, but whatever charms that film might have had, they are utterly lost on the people behind this embarrassment."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,38,"The casting does the film few favors. Ramirez is charismatic, but has none of Patrick Swayze’s mad twinkle. It’s a humorless film that makes you go “Wow” more than it involves you."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,35,"The first “Point Break” was absurd and hyper-macho, but the director committed to the story enough to make it, at the very least, vibrantly watchable. This remake offers nothing but the absurdity, along with a handful of impressive stunt sequences that are both its reason for being and a complete distraction from what little story is happening here."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,33,The new Point Break drops the original’s Zen-like balance of macho mysticism and camp in favor of dour humorlessness.
Point Break,5.3,28782481,30,"Uninterested in competing on the bromance front, or even on the action-thriller front, this new Point Break often plays like an extreme-sports documentary with bits of narrative interstitials to carry us along."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,30,"There are two rules that no version of Point Break should disobey: Don't skimp on surfing and never be boring. That’s two unpardonable strikes against new helmsman Ericson Core, who also photographed this stiff, humorless, tension-free remake in drab 3D."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,30,"The newly released Point Break remake is tedious and overblown — as though the filmmakers were so preoccupied with ""updating"" the material that they forgot what made it so popular in the first place."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,25,"This Point Break doesn’t ever connect with anything, even its own desire to celebrate the extreme."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,25,"The makers were clearly paying attention to the smaller details. But somehow, they missed all the big things that made the first Point Break a memorable escapist film of its time."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,25,"It takes a very special director to make scenes of sky-diving, free climbing, big-wave surfing and BASE jumping something to yawn at. Yet Ericson Core must be that kind of miracle worker, because Point Break, his update of the 1991 cult classic, is basically a cavalcade of extreme sports, but with less drama than a highlight reel."
Point Break,5.3,28782481,20,"The original was indeed ludicrous, but it exuded warmth, vitality, and belief in itself. The 2.0 update splashes up on shore DOA."
The Last Starfighter,6.7,28733290,80,"With The Last Starfighter, director Nick Castle and writer Jonathan Betuel have done something so simple it's almost awe-inspiring: they've taken a very human story and accented it with sci-fi special effects, rather than the other way around."
The Last Starfighter,6.7,28733290,75,"A sweet, unabashedly corny, matinee-friendly science-fiction adventure starring Lance Guest as a trailer-park videogame prodigy, and Robert Preston as the alien who recruits him to save the day from some space-baddies."
The Last Starfighter,6.7,28733290,75,"Clever, exciting, and fun, The Last Starfighter boasts good performances by Guest and Preston, and a literate, funny script that highlights the real story: not the space war that only Guest can win but the difficulty of leaving home, family, and security for a totally new life when the opportunity presents itself."
The Last Starfighter,6.7,28733290,70,"The Last Starfighter is a well-made movie. The special effects are competent. The acting is good, and I enjoyed Robert Preston's fast-talking The Music Man reprise (we've got trouble, right here in the galaxy) and the gentle wit of Dan O'Herlihy's extraterrestrial. But the final spark was missing, the final burst of inspiration that might have pulled all these concepts and inspirations and retreads together into a good movie."
Abduction,5.1,28087155,55,"As Nathan, the teenage hero of Abduction, Lautner shows he's handy with stunts, many of which he clearly and impressively performs himself, and good with a fight scene. But when it comes to exchanges of dialogue, displays of emotion or just standing around, he's stiff and manifestly uncomfortable."
Abduction,5.1,28087155,50,"Director John Singleton offers bits of suspense, but Abduction is less a movie than a piece of engineering, a glumly ludicrous cat-and-mouse blowout designed to win Lautner male fans along with his girl demo."
Abduction,5.1,28087155,50,Abduction puts Lautner in motion and never goes very far wrong as long as he remains in motion.
Abduction,5.1,28087155,50,Odds are John Singleton doesn't know he's made one of the funniest films of the year.
Abduction,5.1,28087155,50,"Aside from such dutiful fan service, the film is a haggardly slapdash ""Bourne Identity"" knockoff, never rising above the level of basic competence."
Abduction,5.1,28087155,42,"Singleton once radiated ambition and vision. These days, he seems to be aiming for mediocrity at best. Even by those extraordinarily lenient standards, the inessential, perfunctory Abduction falls short"
Abduction,5.1,28087155,40,"Abduction is just the third movie John Singleton has directed in the past decade, and it contains neither the passion nor the competence of his two previous genre efforts - ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" and ""Four Brothers."""
Abduction,5.1,28087155,40,"Singleton's action thriller has a decent sense of propulsion but, after a faintly intriguing start, the convoluted plot mechanics overwhelm everything else, making you feel you're watching a detailed blueprint for a movie, and an increasingly far-fetched one in the bargain."
Abduction,5.1,28087155,38,"Filled with laughable dialogue, Abduction goes nowhere."
Abduction,5.1,28087155,30,"Molina and Weaver, who, most of the time, perform brilliantly, move through Abduction as if on autopilot."
Abduction,5.1,28087155,30,A blockhead espionage thriller from director-for-hire John Singleton.
Abduction,5.1,28087155,25,"Perhaps the only way to approach Abduction that will not result in a 105-minute boredom-induced coma is to think of it as a comedy, preferably with a drinking game attached. There are laughs to be had, although none of them are intentional."
Abduction,5.1,28087155,25,Abduction is a crass and lowbrow attempt to cash in on a young actor's heat - an exploitation picture where the person being taken advantage of is too young to notice.
Abduction,5.1,28087155,25,"Taylor Lautner puts the abs in Abduction, but not much else."
Abduction,5.1,28087155,20,"A ridiculously cheesy confection filled with unthrilling thrills, bored-looking adults and a comically overstuffed backstory."
Abduction,5.1,28087155,20,Twi-Hards shall attend en masse. Adults shall roll their eyes. And on our human comedy shall go.
Abduction,5.1,28087155,20,"A sloppy, exploitative act of star worship created (if that's the right word for cynical hackwork) around Mr. Lautner, the pouty 19-year-old heartthrob of the ""Twilight"" franchise."
Abduction,5.1,28087155,12,"Actual abduction may be preferable to the movie of the same name, but only if your kidnappers don't torture you by forcing you to watch it."
Abduction,5.1,28087155,10,"The new film Abduction has a lot of problems, but the biggest is the fact that no one gets abducted. Ever."
Abduction,5.1,28087155,10,"A fourth-rate Hollywood thriller that bungles a lot of thievery from better movies, is entirely bereft of suspense or excitement and features a leading man who absolutely, positively cannot act."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,80,"A comic actor of genius who raises silliness to an art form, the wonderfully expressive Atkinson makes excellent use of those devastating looks in the spy spoof Johnny English, where he turns up as a James Bond type more likely to kill adversaries by accident than on purpose."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,80,"Unlike most movies of this kind, which run out of steam and ideas as they go along, Johnny English gains momentum, nudging you along from a few stray giggles to helpless, giddy laughter."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,80,"The hilarious Malkovich, coiffed in an artful pageboy and savoring a fruity French accent, would overpower the competition on sheer thespian madness."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,75,Delivered with the kind of English aplomb that PBS audiences around the country have come to know and love. It must be the accent.
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,70,An extremely silly but effective enough romp for family audiences.
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,70,"The movie is more a loose collection of skits than a coherent whole. But then, it's never coherence we're looking for when Atkinson's exhausting imagination is cut loose from its fetters. The weird bonus here is John Malkovich's over-the-top performance."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,70,A funny summer frolic.
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,70,"Most Bond parodies tend to flatten because they fail to evoke the production design overkill and slick cinematic style of its target. Johnny English is no different. Director Peter Howitt delivers action like a journeyman, but Atkinson saves him time and again."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,67,"It's a chaste ""Austin Powers,"" a less ridiculous ""Casino Royale,"" a more subtle ""Spy Hard""  in other words, yet another James Bond parody."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,63,"Once in a long while, it even comes tantalizingly close to that rarest of modern film commodities -- ribald wit."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,63,"The jokes often are corny or labored, and the story is predictable. However, Atkinson raises the movie to the level of good fun by the force of his outrageous persona and skill at physical comedy."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,63,"Rowan Atkinson's spy spoof is wildly uneven and yet, at times, nothing less than wildly entertaining."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,60,Malkovich is usually such a numbingly self-serious actor. But he cuts loose here in a way that's outlandishly brilliant: It's his best performance in years.
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,60,"Johnny English's international popularity may or may not translate here, but in a sequel-glutted summer, even a mildly amusing time-waster can't help but stand out."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,60,There weren't enough good laughs for me to recommend it to anyone other than the most devoted Beanheads.
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,50,"Adding to the general air of ''What the hell?'' is Australian pop singer Natalie Imbruglia as Lorna, the beautiful superspy who falls for our hero. With Lorna's help, Johnny discovers that Sauvage is plotting to take over the British throne -- the Battle of Hastings wasn't good enough, it seems."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,50,"Aussie singer Natalie Imbruglia gets to play the babe, nothing more, but she does that brightly. The rest of the movie is a dim bulb."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,50,Where's the real 007 when we really need him? Or better yet -- Calling Inspector Clouseau!
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,50,"An old-fashioned comedy. And in this case, ""old-fashioned"" means tired, out of date and so abominably blah that you'll fall asleep in your popcorn."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,50,"Johnny English never builds any momentum, and Atkinson simply isn't a good enough actor to mine continued laughs from repetitive material."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,50,"By playing the boob so brilliantly, Atkinson allows us the catharsis of recognizing our own incompetencies and lack of poise."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,50,"Despite its contemporary-sounding anti-French cracks, could easily have been made 20 years ago."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,50,"All in all, Johnny English isnt a bad effort. Rowan Atkinson is much more of a comedian than Mike Myers is, but unfortunately Myers had the spy spoof down pat."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,50,"Favorably, Atkinsons family-friendly, rubber-limbed professionalism can revitalize even the most vapid of material, which this certainly is. Anyone who has seen an episode of Black Adder can tell you that hes leaps and bounds funnier than this sitcom-grade bauble."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,50,"On its own modest terms, this romp delivers."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,50,"If you were to strip the ""Austin Powers"" films of their juvenile lewdness, psychedelic decor and swinging soundtrack while leaving intact the potty humor and pratfalls, the result would be something very like this pointless spy spoof."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,40,"Plays like a tired exercise, a spy spoof with no burning desire to be that, or anything else."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,38,"For those looking for something positive, this is the only movie I can recall that features music from both ABBA (""Does Your Mother Know"") and Handel (""Zadok the Priest""). Let's hear it for musical diversity!"
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,38,"Smug with timely zingers like ""The only thing the French should be allowed to host is an invasion,"" the movie's recommended strictly for Bush advisers."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,30,"The film manages the rare trick of improving as it unrolls from the utterly putrid to the barely tolerable. And, friends, I wish to say that sometimes that is as good as you can hope for in this racket."
Johnny English,6.2,28082366,25,"This is strictly dull chuckles from dull wits, and while there are a few genuine laughs to be found amidst the dross, theyre as rare as Francophiles in Crawford, Texas."
Cannonball Run II,4.9,28078073,40,"The fact that Cannonball Run II isn't much good may not prevent it from becoming this summer's best- loved lowest-common-denominator comedy, if only because of the utter absence of any competition."
Cannonball Run II,4.9,28078073,40,"There are nun jokes, mafia jokes, big breast jokes, karate jokes, Jaws jokes, more big breasts. It's a long ride."
Cannonball Run II,4.9,28078073,20,"Execution is uninspired, laughs are hard to find, and the script is also difficult to locate. Reynold’s high-pitched laugh is wearing thin."
Cannonball Run II,4.9,28078073,12,Cannonball Run II is one of the laziest insults to the intelligence of moviegoers that I can remember. Sheer arrogance made this picture.
Cannonball Run II,4.9,28078073,10,"Burt Reynolds and a host of notable performers seem to be having a hell of a good time wandering through this meandering, episodic farce, but rarely is their good mood shared by the viewer."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,75,"While most other films sprint through expository dialogue, and bluster their way through action scenes, The Last Witch Hunter is measured enough to make you want to suspend your disbelief."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,70,"The story works out like you might expect. The joys are in the way director Breck Eisner, like Diesel, is earnest about this goofiness. His direction might not showcase the full wit of the script, but it does honor its inventiveness."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,63,"It has enough ingredients for a reasonably entertaining fantasy adventure—except, that is, for an interesting lead character with an emotionally compelling hook."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,58,"It’s a shame that The Last Witch Hunter ends up crumbling into another generic showdown of murky fantasy effects and snatched artifacts, with a final shot that is literally framed around a door to possible sequels."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,50,"The Last Witch Hunter is redeemed through complex visual-effects work that aptly illuminates Goodman’s netherworld. Further, Diesel’s stolid performance is balanced through the supporting star power of Caine – even with criminally limited scenes – and Rose Leslie’s “dream walker,” whose earnestness makes even the world of a macho witch hunter seem entirely plausible."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,50,"The Last Witch Hunter feels like the first episode of a would-be series although, unlike some similar endeavors, it tells a stand-alone story."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,50,"As Kaulder, Diesel does what he does, rumbling out lines of silly dialogue in his subwoofer of a voice. As far as acting goes, there’s not much."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,50,"In its favor, The Last Witch Hunter boasts some terrific production design and digital effects.... Less impressively, Eisner’s movie is clogged with cardboard characters, flat dialogue and a sluggish middle act that gets lost in too much fabricated witchy folklore."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,45,"The Last Witch Hunter aims for pulpy, comic-book fun, but it’s never as fleet, funny, or detailed as it needs to be. And if you’re looking for something above middling in terms of plot, characters, world-building, even action sequences, you’ll need to seek it elsewhere."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,40,"Like its star, The Last Witch Hunter is big, overblown and frequently incomprehensible."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,38,The script’s messy seams also show in the parade of sidekicks that passes through Kaulder’s door as a new threat develops.
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,33,"Seemingly every time there was an opportunity to do something fun, The Last Witch Hunter runs in the other direction, creating an unfortunately heavy-handed, humorless, self-serious tone for a story that should be allowed to be a little goofy."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,30,Watching The Last Witch Hunter is like sitting by while someone else plays a game whose coolness eludes us.
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,30,"The Last Witch Hunter is one of those artlessly restless, exposition-dialogue fantasy-action slogs that, thanks to Breck Eisner's untamed direction, never manages to corral all the potion talk, mythology rationale and leaps back and forth in time into anything remotely entertaining."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,30,"Director Eisner helmed the excellent remake of George R. Romero’s The Crazies back in 2010, but this film shows none of the lunatic flair for the ghastly that the previous film so easily served up."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,25,"This abortion of a thriller fails, utterly, and bombed completely. So even though there’s a “Witch Hunter 2” in development, don’t count on it."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,25,The movie left me amazed — amazed that Nicolas Cage wasn’t in it.
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,25,There are two main obstacles to enjoying The Last Witch Hunter. One is your ability to buy Vin Diesel as an immortal slayer of evildoers plying his trade in today’s Manhattan. You also have to swallow a by-the-numbers plot buried under an avalanche of fast-and-furious but underwhelming CGI effects.
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,20,"A smorgasbord of empty calories, the Vin Diesel vehicle The Last Witch Hunter, for all its overstuffed visuals, leaves you hungry. But not for more."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,20,"This is a relentlessly unengaging affair, its derivative and logic-deficient script matched by flat direction and fussy, unconvincing CGI."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,20,"There are certainly enough dopey diversions here for The Last Witch Hunter to be considerably more fun than it is, but even its most extravagant bouts of silliness are hampered by desultory plotting and Eisner’s oppressively synthetic mise-en-scene."
The Last Witch Hunter,6,27367660,12,"It’s just deadly and dreadful, loud and obnoxious, convoluted and irritating, horrible and dumb."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,80,"For his robust and handsome The Musketeer, Hyams enlisted veteran Hong Kong stunt coordinator Xin-Xin Xiong to stage a clutch of spectacular action sequences that are amusing in the imaginative intricacy of their bravura."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,63,"I cannot in strict accuracy recommend this film. It's such a jumble of action and motivation, ill-defined characters and action howlers."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,60,"Moves in fits and starts, with some crafty and credible fight choreography by Xin Xin Xiong on either side of the pretty but boring middle hour."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,50,"If this is Dumas, there's a ""b"" in the middle and an extra ""s"" at the end."

The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,50,"Rollicks and rolls, thanks mainly to Roth's over-the-top depravity and Xiong's swingin', ""Crouching Tiger""-style choreography."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,50,The novelty value of seeing 17th-century French swordsmen fight like Chinese martial artists doesn't compensate for the film's generally wooden performances and clichéd dialogue.
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,40,Appallingly flat.
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,38,"East/West fusion aside, The Musketeer is a stale Euro-pudding."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,38,"Dramatically as well as visually, The Musketeer conflicts with itself by trying to blend grand old- school costume drama and MTV- style rhythm and attitude into the same movie. The juxtapositions are often preposterous."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,33,"The movie lacks the one thing that the classic ""Three Musketeers"" story can't do without: panache."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,30,What a stupefying thing it is.
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,30,"Musketeer's fight scenes are underlit, overmiked, and appallingly edited, with none of the spacious grace that even routine Asian action flicks get right. Worse, the narrative scenes make less sense."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,25,"The Musketeer is the worst Hollywood period film in -- it seems like ages since ""American Outlaws."""
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,25,"Hyams (""End of Days,"" ""Timecop""), who is his own cinematographer, has no idea how to shoot or compose Xiong's wired choreography."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,25,"There isn't a frame of The Musketeer that's believable even as a Hollywood re-creation of a fantasy world. It's conventionally picturesque, except in the nighttime and interior scenes, which are dark to the point of glaucoma."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,25,Unspeakably awful.
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,25,"Has the distinction of being the very worst of all the many film versions of Alexandre Dumas' classic novel, ""The Three Musketeers."" Nothing else in Musketeer movie history comes even remotely close to its staggering wretchedness."
Rush,8.1,26947624,100,"Rush ranks among the best movies about auto racing ever made, featuring two great performances from the leads, who capture not only the physical look of the racing legends they’re playing, but the vastly different character traits that made their rivalry, well, made for the movies."
Rush,8.1,26947624,100,"The movie's finest performance is Daniel Bruhl's unapologetic bluntness as Lauda, and his subtle conveyance of jealousy the driver — whose resemblance to a rat is often noted — must have felt about Hunt's popularity and handsomeness."
Rush,8.1,26947624,100,Brilliantly captures the exhilaration that comes from facing death head-on. It's also an ode to joyous rivalry.
Rush,8.1,26947624,100,"Not just one of the great racing movies of all time, but a virtuoso feat of filmmaking in its own right, elevated by two of the year’s most compelling performances."
Rush,8.1,26947624,100,"Utterly gripping. Aided by two punchy lead turns, an Oscar-worthy script and stunning in-car footage, Howard’s race film delivers top-gear drama. A piston- and heart-pumping triumph."
Rush,8.1,26947624,90,"Howard, whose first job as a director was the 1977 Roger Corman-produced “Grand Theft Auto,” has captured what is surely the greatest racing footage ever shot."
Rush,8.1,26947624,90,"Mr. Howard doesn’t just want you to crawl inside a Formula One racecar, he also wants you to crawl inside its driver’s head."
Rush,8.1,26947624,90,"It's both a perceptive dual character study and, that rarity of rarities, a large-scale action movie for grown-ups, one worth leaving the house for."
Rush,8.1,26947624,88,"Rush, which marks a return to form (and more so) for Howard after plodding through adultery buddy movie comedies (The Dilemma) and Dan Brown sequeldom (Angels & Demons), is almost primal."
Rush,8.1,26947624,88,"In a way, Howard has made a philosophical drama about the way men move through the world. It’s just a really, really fast drama."
Rush,8.1,26947624,88,"A fine and fun film tribute to the milieu, the men, women and machines in a sport that was never deadlier or more glamorous than its Disco Decade incarnation."
Rush,8.1,26947624,88,"It's Morgan's core script, full of humor, heartache and verbal fireworks, that lifts Rush above the ""Fast & Furious"" herd."
Rush,8.1,26947624,86,Rush is one of those rare sports movies that’s compelling as both a drama and a spectacle.
Rush,8.1,26947624,85,"A swift-moving, character-rich biopic whose kinetic Grand Prix sequences are constantly being overshadowed by genuinely riveting scenes of ... people talking."
Rush,8.1,26947624,83,"Rush is a pretty thrilling piece of pop entertainment. It's excitingly assembled and moves like a bullet, highly engaging and nerve-wracking when it needs to be and light on its feet elsewhere."
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,"Rush is just that -- a rush, and a film that is sure to get audiences' engines going."
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,This is tremendously exciting cinema – shot by the boundary-pushing Anthony Dod Mantle – as well as old-school escapist drama with ample eye candy for viewers of all persuasions.
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,Rush satisfies our lust for both grand character combat and deadly gearhead spectacle.
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,"Rush is fast, slippery, stormy and dangerous."
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,"What Rush has to offer is a great human drama, two dangerously talented men pushing each other to risky victory and a superb script, delivered with some mastery by Hemsworth and Brühl."
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,"It rarely deviates from formula, but Rush wins big, delivering the most exciting F1 footage created for film. Like Hunt, it is sexy, funny, full of thrills. Like Lauda, it is intelligent, a bit blunt, but ultimately touching."
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,"Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl excel as, respectively, British wild man and hedonist James Hunt and Austrian by-the-books tactician Niki Lauda."
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,"Rush has sex, glamour, a fair degree of wit and a breathless, pedal-to-the-metal spirit. But its greatest achievement may be to underline that there are real men, all vulnerable flesh and blood, inside those infernal machines."
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,"Rush, though it will win no trophies, is fine filmmaking, a smart, visually engorged, frequently thrilling tale of boyish competition — inspired by a true story. At heart it’s “Amadeus” on wheels, only this time Salieri is the Austrian."
Rush,8.1,26947624,75,"The result is a solid film, but one that remains more interesting than intense."
Rush,8.1,26947624,75,"Howard directs Rush with speed and jangly, jarring verve, bringing the races themselves to white-knuckled life and allowing the men’s stories to play out with only slightly predictable reversals, upsets and, inevitably, those hard lessons learned."
Rush,8.1,26947624,75,"The ego trips and sexuality and driving are all filmed with equal intensity, to the point where the emotions and flesh and crunched metal seem to blend together. The movie's only major problem is that the tension sometimes overwhelms."
Rush,8.1,26947624,75,"Formula One fans who remember 1976 will no doubt delight in the film but, for those who (like me) were more interested in other things during the year of America's bicentennial, it's not only a good lesson in sports history but an entertaining two hours to spend in a theater."
Rush,8.1,26947624,75,"Rush is the kind of Hollywood studio production that has sadly become all too rare — a smart, exciting, R-rated entertainment for grown-ups that quickens your pulse and puts on a great show without ever insulting your intelligence."
Rush,8.1,26947624,75,"Rush hits a few potholes, but in the end it reveals the psyches of two men who only feel alive when they're cheating death."
Rush,8.1,26947624,75,"Though one enjoys and appreciates Rush for what it is, it does not thrill the blood the way we have the right to expect a film like this to do."
Rush,8.1,26947624,70,Howard and Morgan make the journey intense enough to keep audiences guessing up to the finish line.
Rush,8.1,26947624,70,"Rush, a film about two real-life titans of Formula One racing in the Seventies, splits its narrative between these oil-and-water personalities, which feels about right: It's only half of a good movie."
Rush,8.1,26947624,67,"Rush isn’t bad, exactly, but it’s like a standard-issue male action programmer that somehow crept in from an earlier era."
Rush,8.1,26947624,67,"Rush, in other words, is a foursquare sportsmanship movie, offering little in the way of surprises but plenty of earnest, satisfying thrills."
Rush,8.1,26947624,67,"The problem with car-racing movies, though, is that they are car-racing movies. Has any director found a way to spare audiences the eventual tedium of watching automobiles go around and around a track and instead capture the thrill of the sport?"
Rush,8.1,26947624,63,"It's big, brash and dramatically it goes in circles. The first two may be enough for most people, especially if they're into Formula One racing, to overlook the third."
Rush,8.1,26947624,63,"Howard, whose previous tales of men in professional peril include the topnotch “Apollo 13” as well as “Backdraft” and “Cinderella Man,” works with cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle to create a style in the racing scenes that makes the most of every angle. By the time the final lap of Rush starts, we’re up for the ride."
Rush,8.1,26947624,60,"I might have tolerated the film much more with the sound off. With the volume on, this movie feels like a mucho-macho Saturday morning cartoon—specifically Bugs Bunny toying with his eternal pursuer, Elmer Fudd."
Rush,8.1,26947624,50,"For all its immersion in the roar, grease and danger of Formula One, the fact-based Rush — about the sport's great rivalry of the 1970s — is also more predictable than a pit stop, something well-suited to Mr. Howard. He's made perfectly palatable pictures, but never a truly great one, partly because he has such a weakness for the commercial and a consequent gift for the obvious."
Rush,8.1,26947624,50,"The movie leans on symbolic imagery that’s alternately tired and ridiculous: Hunt’s impatiently flicked cigarette lighter (yes, he’s a candle waiting to be lit) or a black-widow spider crawling up the stands of one particularly dangerous course. These are classic frenemies; their tale deserves more gas in the tank."
Rush,8.1,26947624,40,"Ron Howard's by-the-seat-of-your-pants aesthetic makes the slower, darker sequences feel hurried and bland, especially when stacked up next to the racing sequences."

xXx: State of the Union,4.4,26873932,50,"Basically the first movie all over again, with plenty more of the bridge-jumping, rocket-launching action that audiences loved about the original."
xXx: State of the Union,4.4,26873932,50,"You'd half expect the Xbox logo to pop up on the credit roll for XXX: State of the Union, since what's on view is closer to a videogame than a movie. While that will be music to the ears of young gamers, it's noise to anyone hoping for a coherent action movie."
xXx: State of the Union,4.4,26873932,50,"At least this movie seems more aware of its trashiness than ""National Treasure"" was. It's therefore freer to have some off-the-cuff fun the way Steven Seagal's more tolerable vehicles once did."
xXx: State of the Union,4.4,26873932,50,"A big, loud, proudly brainless popcorn flick that blows up cars, trucks, tanks, boats, helicopters and even a train."
xXx: State of the Union,4.4,26873932,50,"This is a movie about guns blazing, men punching, speedometers straining and explosions exploding. On all those levels, it succeeds just fine - which makes for a great amusement-park ride, but perhaps not much of a movie."
xXx: State of the Union,4.4,26873932,50,"Hilariously, gut-bustingly, mind-blowingly, jaw-droppingly stupid."
xXx: State of the Union,4.4,26873932,50,"Director Lee Tamahori (Die Another Day) has a shruggingly action-intensive style, which feels at once heavy-handed and lazy."
xXx: State of the Union,4.4,26873932,40,"Of course the movie's real raison d'etre is watching Ice Cube tear up government facilities and blockades with a tank, spout Schwarzenegger-style kiss-off lines, and commandeer the kind of babes and high-tech cars that James Bond usually plays with."
xXx: State of the Union,4.4,26873932,40,"It's even louder and dumber than the first XXX, but if watching things fall down and go boom in a very big way makes you cheer, you're in luck."

xXx: State of the Union,4.4,26873932,25,"Critics are inclined to describe the action in films like ""XXX"" and Lee Tamahori's sequel, XXX: State of the Union, as ""cartoon violence."" I'll resist doing that out of respect for cartoons."
xXx: State of the Union,4.4,26873932,25,"The most gratifying thing about xXx: State of the Union is that nobody wastes much time on character, motivation, plausibility, dialogue or sex -- all that slow stuff that drags down ordinary movies."

Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,83,"Once one is acclimated to this chaos-cinema form, even if it’s a bit more assaultive in post-converted 3D, the writer-director’s simultaneous economic storytelling and boyish imagination come into clear view."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,75,"Like most films of its type, “The Final Chapter” is utterly ridiculous in every possible way but unlike a lot of them (I am looking at you, “Underworld”), it at least has a healthy sense of its own absurd nature that comes as a blessed relief. And a couple of the action bits are gloriously goofy to behold."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,75,"For fans of “Resident Evil,” I believe this final film will not disappoint, but it also will likely encourage newcomers to the saga to go back and play a bit of catch-up by watching the earlier movies."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,67,"The climax makes for a satisfying conclusion to the franchise—an ending which this writer expects, and even hopes, all concerned will studiously ignore when they get around to making the next one."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,66,"For the first time, the story supports and adds to the action rather than distract from it; it’s almost as though Anderson was holding back in the earlier films because he wanted to save the best for last."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,63,The Resident Evil films are so unconcerned with traditional character and narrative that they suggest either abstract art or the fevered brainstorming of a child at play.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,60,There’s no denying the movie’s climactic gathering of females bent on saving the species.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,60,"Boasting a higher body count than its IQ, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter is violent, idiotic fun."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,60,"The movie percolates enough that even when, at its climax, it shamelessly recycles a grisly punch line from 1987’s “RoboCop,” it’s kind of endearing, not least because Mr. Anderson and company make it work."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,58,Combining Anderson’s symmetrical camera style with frenetic editing ends up imploding the sense of depth and space that has long made the director’s movies must-sees in 3-D.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,50,"Jovovich binds the episodic action sequences, her face a mask of noble pain and isolation. She outruns zombies, orchestrates catapults of flaming gasoline, literally slays a dragon with a Hummer – and all without a single unnecessary quip or wasted kiss."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,50,"A few individual scenes of hand-to-hand and foot-to-face combat are undeniably exciting, and Jovovich once again impresses with her kinetic athleticism. Overall, however, the repetitiveness and occasional incoherence of the nonstop action leave the audience exhausted for all the wrong reasons."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,40,Reasonably entertaining but hectic (supposed) finale for the up-and-down series.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,40,"Hush and patience are simply not in Anderson’s vocabulary. He bombards you as if terrified of encroaching tedium, and the set pieces trip each other up in their sheer haste."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,40,"The action is practically non-stop from beginning to end, but is never remotely exciting due to the Cuisinart-style editing that reduces it all to an incomprehensible, messy blur."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,40,"True, the movie's intense, and Jovovich is certainly in fighting shape. But after 15 years of this franchise, it's getting hard to tell Alice from the things she's fighting. It's all squint and grunt, slash and groan."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,30,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter proves that there's nothing left in the tank of this grossly nondescript zombie-shootin' franchise.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,25,There’s a fascinating satire of America’s unholy alliance of heartless corporations and the religious dupes who worship them just sitting here. But it’ll take a wit far cleverer than action hack Paul W.S. Anderson to work that out.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,20,The film is drab and epileptic.
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,58,Undiscriminating comedy fans hungering for the High School High of superhero parodies need look no further.
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,50,"Given the abysmal quality of recent spoof pics, it's saying something that Superhero Movie provides a fairly steady stream of midsized laughs -- and even the 40% or so of gags that just lie there aren't actively painful."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,50,How can you tell the target age for Superhero Movie is exactly 13 1/2 years? Because most of the jokes are Internet-related.
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,50,"The very act of writing critically about Superhero Movie inspires something of an existential crisis -- no one likely to turn out for it is reading this review, and anybody reading this review is probably not inclined to see it under any circumstances."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,50,"Puerile and idiotic it may be, but Superhero Movie is nonetheless smarter than most of its lowbrow brethren in the Hollywood sub-sub-category known as the spoof movie."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,42,"Seems to have been given the comedy equivalent of blood thinner. It has the blazing satirical boldness to skewer the first Tobey Maguire Spider-Man -- and, amazingly, not much else."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,40,By-the-numbers screen parody fails to resurrect an increasingly tired genre.
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,40,"The gags are consistently weak, though actor Miles Fisher turns in a hair-raising impression of Tom Cruise."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,40,"What's shocking about Superhero Movie is not that it's been advertised to death on Nickelodeon to impressionable children, but that it's a completely on-the-nose satire of ""Spider-Man.”"
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,40,This super-powered spoof just doesn't fly.
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,30,"Predictable, flat, full of name-dropping, tragically unhip, and likely to make a decent amount of cash."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,30,"No real mockery is intended by this harmless, mindless grab bag of slightly used gags, which lampoons some of the conventions of recent comic-book epics and adds the expected staples of juvenile humor: urine, vomit and intestinal gas."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,20,"It's a tonally confused comedy which, for once, doesn't go far enough comedically."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,0,"This abysmal ""Spider-Man"" satire has more in common with the lamentable spate of ""Epic"" and ""Date Movies"" than Zucker and Nielsen's truly funny ""Naked Gun"" series."
The Host,5.9,26627201,63,"A silly, if fun, futuristic sci-fi romance."
The Host,5.9,26627201,63,"The Host will make perfect sense to 12-year-old girls, while their college-age sisters will probably laugh themselves sick and their mothers will look at Hurt and wonder when he got so old."
The Host,5.9,26627201,63,"The Host is top-heavy with profound, sonorous conversations, all tending to sound like farewells. The movie is so consistently pitched at the same note, indeed, that the structure robs it of possibilities for dramatic tension."
The Host,5.9,26627201,60,"The Host gets bogged down in its “who’s kissing whom now?” dynamics, and it becomes all too easy to snicker at it."
The Host,5.9,26627201,60,"An ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" retread told from a postoccupation vantage point, this adaptation of Stephenie Meyer’s YA romance novel unfolds in a dystopian future when alien parasites have nearly won the battle for Earth."
The Host,5.9,26627201,58,"The Host is a step up from the endless metaphorical lectures and gaping plot holes of Niccol’s last film, In Time, but its muffled emotions, delivered with Twilight-esque blank-eyed calm, put it in the same category of a creative idea hamstrung in execution."
The Host,5.9,26627201,50,"As with the Twilight series, The Host's infelicities—drab dialogue, ridiculous plotting, more emotional crises than there is story—are enlivened by its thematic eccentricities."
The Host,5.9,26627201,50,Saoirse Ronan's talents are wasted on a foolish dual part in this dull sci-fi fantasy.
The Host,5.9,26627201,50,"There's something about novelist Stephenie Meyer that induces formerly interesting directors to suddenly make films that are slow, silly and soporific."
The Host,5.9,26627201,50,Extravagantly silly but undeniably entertaining sci-fi soap opera.
The Host,5.9,26627201,50,"'Twilight' of the Body Snatchers, without much urgency or sexual heat."
The Host,5.9,26627201,42,"The Host doesn't strive for social allegory, as previous body snatcher flicks have done with the Red Scare, civil rights and Watergate. If anything it's merely a teenage girl's fantasy checklist for prom."
The Host,5.9,26627201,40,"This film adaptation feels like YA, with cat’s-cradle love matches, soft-focus sexuality, and a main character who never satisfactorily makes the transition from page to screen."
The Host,5.9,26627201,40,"Niccol and Meyer -- who co-produces this, her first post-""Twilight"" film -- choose to trade away any shred of the ripe social subtext that has made other body-snatcher films so rich. In its place: the kind of supernatural, star-crossed romance that generates so much swooning from Team ""Twilight."""
The Host,5.9,26627201,40,"Watch closely and you might even spy a better film inside, straining to break free."
The Host,5.9,26627201,40,"The movie, based on the novel by Stephenie Meyer of “Twilight” fame and directed by Andrew Niccol, is just kind of dumb. Like the more famous books and movies, about a love triangle between a vampire, a werewolf and a human girl, it often plays like a teenage girl’s idea of how literary romances play out."
The Host,5.9,26627201,38,"To work, The Host would have required a visionary interpretation rather than the mundane telling that Niccol opts for."
The Host,5.9,26627201,38,"The Host basically comes down to a vote for Team Jared or Team Ian. I voted myself into oblivion about half an hour in. Niccol, who once added mystery and suspense to the sci-fi of 1997's ""Gattaca,"" is no match for the giant marshmallow that is The Host."
The Host,5.9,26627201,37,It’s a mushy and unsuspenseful melodrama.
The Host,5.9,26627201,30,"The story goes slack onscreen, so much so that the movie's two-plus hours will seem an eternity."
The Host,5.9,26627201,30,"Dopey, derivative and dull, The Host is a brazen combination of unoriginal science-fiction themes, young-adult pandering and bottom-line calculation. That sounds like it should work (really!), but it never does, largely because the story is as drained of energy as are its moony aliens."
The Host,5.9,26627201,25,"Ronan, youthfully elegant as always, tries hard, but the material defeats her."
The Host,5.9,26627201,25,"Its title, very graciously, doesn't end with a ""Part 1,"" but The Host sure has enough plot points and ideas to fill two installments."
The Host,5.9,26627201,25,"A long, tedious and often unintentionally hilarious adaptation of Stephenie Meyer’s sci-fi follow-up."
The Host,5.9,26627201,25,An invasion of the body snatchers is preferable to realizing that the true horror perpetrated here is not on the characters but on the audience.
The Host,5.9,26627201,25,"The film may as well be titled ""Stephenie Meyer's Waiting Around."""
The Host,5.9,26627201,20,"Steven Spielberg famously retained his childhood sense of wonder. On this evidence, Meyer has maintained a nine-year-old's notion of titillating romance."
The Host,5.9,26627201,0,It's really a dramatic sinkhole.
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,58,"During a dinner with Stephanie's colorfully ethnic family, including a squandered Debbie Reynolds, the reaction shots arrive with bludgeoning regularity, and the soundtrack's burbling organ serves as an incessant reminder not to take anything seriously. Fortunately, there's no danger of that."
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,50,The biggest problem One for the Money faces is trying to have it both ways: gritty-ethnic inner city vs. girly-girly comic.
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,40,"Wouldn't it make more sense on basic cable? Plum screen incarnate (and film producer) Katherine Heigl got her start in TV, on Roswell and Grey's Anatomy, and her public persona – a combination of prickliness and adoration-seeking that has famously grated on viewers' and critics' nerves alike – has historically played better there."
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,30,"Most depressing is the spectacle of Debbie Reynolds in the de rigueur Betty White role - Hollywood having relegated seniors to the category of adorably ""outrageous"" while it caricatures single women as desperate updates on romance-novel heroines."
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,30,"An attempt to inaugurate a new movie franchise, something that might appeal to women and mystery fans. This is a perfectly sound ambition, but the movie, directed by Julie Anne Robinson from a script by Stacy Sherman, Karen Ray and Liz Brixius, is so weary and uninspired that it feels more like an exhausted end than an energetic beginning."
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,30,"As played by Heigl, Stephanie is mind-blowingly charmless."
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,30,"Making even more appearances than the rodent is the Big Gulp; the lady bounty hunter is constantly consuming junk - though at least when Heigl is snacking, she isn't talking."
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,30,"Starring a painfully awkward Katherine Heigl, One for the Money mostly resembles a failed television pilot."
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,25,"I guess I can't call the movie sexist as it was largely produced, directed and written by women. So I'll settle for calling it dull, corny and amateurish instead."
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,25,"One for the Money is like The Bounty Hunter by Andy Tennant, if you dipped it in self-tanner and strapped some Four Loko on it."
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,25,It will have you groaning between yawns.
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,25,"Listlessly directed by Julie Anne Robinson (Miley Cyrus's The Last Song) from a script written by a trio of writers (Stacy Sherman, Karen Ray and Liz Brixius), One for the Money is tepidly glib throughout."
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,20,"Flirty bickering is rampant but, courtesy of Heigl's inert performance, there's no heat or humor to the proceedings, just an avalanche of grating big-hair-and-bad-accent New Joisey caricatures."
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,20,She's (Heigl) disastrously miscast as a character beloved by fans of novelist Janet Evanovich.
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,10,Tedious and tonally inept.
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,0,"One for the Money is as static and ugly as romantic-comedies get, the distractingly fragmented coverage of simple dialogue scenes suggesting a general ineptitude that's rare at the studio level."
One for the Money,5.3,26414527,0,"Everything in One for the Money rings cringingly false, from Heigl's absurd Snooki accent to Plum's romance with Joe Morelli, an Italian cop, played by – faith and begorrah – Jason O'Mara. To dismiss Julie Anne Robinson's direction as clueless would be a kindness."
The World's End,7,26004851,100,The World’s End isn’t perfect – – but its best moments leave the bulk of recent American “event movies” gasping in the dust.
The World's End,7,26004851,100,"The World’s End not only makes a more than worthy conclusion to the Cornetto trilogy — it stands on its own as one of the sharpest, saddest and wisest comedies of the year."
The World's End,7,26004851,100,"What ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" did for zombie and cop flicks The World's End does for sci-fi fatalism, respecting its doomsday tropes while presenting them with cheeky wit and a refreshing strategy of sensory underload."
The World's End,7,26004851,100,"The beauty of this movie, both a nostalgic romp and a futuristic scream, is its stubborn insistence on getting all the trapped-in-amber details right."
The World's End,7,26004851,100,This is by light-years the most entertaining movie of the year. How many apocalyptic sci-fi action extravaganzas leave you feeling as if the world is just beginning?
The World's End,7,26004851,100,An ordinary drama embellished and in some sense infringed on by genre elements rather than the other way around.
The World's End,7,26004851,91,"Easily one of the year’s best comedies, the movie thrives off the chemistry between its leads, with Pegg painting a very funny portrait of emotional paralysis and Frost demonstrating a heretofore unseen talent for intimidation."
The World's End,7,26004851,90,"Indeed, while the action-packed final act of The World’s End gets pretty formulaic (as it channels everything from “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” to “The Stepford Wives”), there’s ALMOST something serious at the core of this riotous comedy."
The World's End,7,26004851,90,"As in all of Wright’s films, the surface is just as satisfying as the subtext: hilarious comedy, compelling character drama, eye-popping visuals, and a juicy science-fiction story."
The World's End,7,26004851,88,"Wright is a brilliant director of turbocharged exposition, elegant but bruising action sequences, and graphically bold comedic overkill."
The World's End,7,26004851,88,It'll knock you on you ass from laughing when you're not rubbing your eyes in disbelief.
The World's End,7,26004851,88,"The cast is amazing, from the great duo of Frost and Pegg to the supporting players, many of whom are better known for taking on heavy dramatic fare. The editing, special effects and set design — a joy to experience."
The World's End,7,26004851,88,"The movie is madly, wonderfully at odds with itself."
The World's End,7,26004851,87,"A knowing take on movies and maturity alike, The World’s End is just as thoroughly thoughtful as those which came before it, and maybe more than ever, you’ll find yourself laughing to keep from crying."
The World's End,7,26004851,83,"As in their previous comedies, Pegg and Frost play men who refuse to stop acting like boys. But these pint-swilling Peter Pans also know how to work the heart and the brain for belly laughs."
The World's End,7,26004851,80,"There is something weird about the twins, something that will fuel a bar room brawl until it goes quite literally global, that will let director Wright take a leap into another genre entirely and that will allow The World's End to spin into ever grander comic mayhem, even as it becomes a surprisingly effecting look at the folly of trying to recapture one's youth."
The World's End,7,26004851,80,"The buzz of The World’s End is more like an antic sugar high than a reeling, drunken stupor. There are no headaches, dry mouth or crushing shame at the end — no “Hangover,” in other words. I’ll drink to that."
The World's End,7,26004851,80,The World's End stands on its own as hilarious high-end nonsense.
The World's End,7,26004851,80,"Some inner logic may not hold up under the sober light of day, but this unusual action-comedy has the loosey-goosey feel of something that can’t miss, like a soused round of bar pool. The final triumph: In a summer full of capes and masks, beer-bellied Frost tears off his shirt à la the Hulk. It’s this season’s best superhero moment."
The World's End,7,26004851,80,"Audacious and witty, The World's End is a strange brew."
The World's End,7,26004851,80,"A mix of comedy, science fiction, nostalgia, adolescent wish-fulfillment and beer, beer, beer, its parts shouldn’t fit together as neatly as they do. But somehow Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg have again managed to make a movie that is knowing, touching and hilarious."
The World's End,7,26004851,80,"The World's End is a big, shaggy dog of a thing, a free-spirited ramble held together by off-kilter asides, clever-dumb puns, and seemingly random bits of dialogue that could almost become catchphrases in spite of themselves."
The World's End,7,26004851,80,"The armageddon-through-beer-goggles approach brings the chuckles, but The World’s End stands up as a great example of the genre it ribs. Nostalgic, bittersweet and very, very funny."
The World's End,7,26004851,80,"The World’s End is a fitting end to the trilogy: it is by turns trashy, poignant and gut-bustingly funny, and often all three at once."
The World's End,7,26004851,80,"While things get a tad buckled town in mayhem and special effects throughout the film’s busy final reels, Wright spends enough time sketching out his mischievous middle-aged men so that their journey...feels worthwhile and even meaningful for a few of them."
The World's End,7,26004851,80,"Bravely refusing to rigidly adhere to a formula that has been so successful, Wright, Pegg and Frost’s Cornetto Trilogy closer has tonal shifts you won’t expect, but the same beating heart you’ve been craving."
The World's End,7,26004851,80,"This is a tighter, smarter film than either Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, and buried beneath all the blue-goo aliens and terrible punning is a heartfelt meditation on the perils and pleasures of nostalgia."
The World's End,7,26004851,78,The World’s End affectionately takes a page from our Fifties sci-fi films.
The World's End,7,26004851,75,"There's a lot of fun to be had in watching The World's End and, surprisingly, more thematic depth than one might expect. The humor, true to its British roots, may baffle some Americans but those who ""get"" it will laugh quite a bit."
The World's End,7,26004851,75,This movie’s pleasures are less about its villains and more about the interplay between Pegg and Frost.
The World's End,7,26004851,75,"When the movie is funny, it’s very funny."
The World's End,7,26004851,75,"Until the sci-fi switcheroo, the versatile supporting cast puts Gary in such a ridiculous light that we can’t help laughing at him. Then suddenly this subversive movie challenges us to laugh at our own assumptions."
The World's End,7,26004851,75,"The result is an original picture, not entirely successful, but successful enough, and delightful in its ability to surprise viewers, and juggle tones and keep every ball in the air. The World's End has the aura - and this might only be an attractive illusion - of something imagined whole, in a burst of inspiration, rather than as something labored over."
The World's End,7,26004851,75,"Smart, funny, and gross (often at the same time)."
The World's End,7,26004851,75,"The World’s End builds to an unexpectedly witty, funny climax that flies in the face of most films of its genre, and although its humor is not for all tastes, no one can say this crazy picture doesn’t have the guts to live up to its title."
The World's End,7,26004851,75,"Despite a too-long third act, dragging action sequences and an epilogue that would have been better left on the cutting room floor, the wordy wit and ingenuity of The World’s End is a sloppy triumph over this summer’s other alien/robot hybrid flick, ""Pacific Rim."""
The World's End,7,26004851,75,This is a movie that floats by on dazzlingly silly banter and well-slung slang.
The World's End,7,26004851,75,"Despite its shortcomings, The World's End glistens with a comedic energy not present in equivalent mainstream blockbusters."
The World's End,7,26004851,70,A fraction less gut-bustingly goofy than its predecessors.
The World's End,7,26004851,70,"The World’s End is more frantic than funny, but it’s still funny enough — just — to outweigh its own silliness."
The World's End,7,26004851,63,"The premise of visiting so many pubs as a narrative device, however, bogs down the initially energetic pacing and goofiness. Piling on the mayhem renders The World's End a sometimes chaotic and uneven comedy."
The World's End,7,26004851,63,"Also helping to sell it all is the fact that these films, goofy though they may be, feature a consistently high level of acting. In addition to Pegg, we get Martin Freeman (""The Hobbit""), Paddy Considine (""Red Riding""), Eddie Marsan (""Sherlock Holmes"") and Bill Nighy (""Love Actually""), all of whom have appeared previously in the trilogy."
The World's End,7,26004851,60,"As a film whose central theme emphasizes the dangers of living in the past, Wright, Pegg and Frost become fatally distracted by nostalgia, eventually paying too much homage to previous classics—especially their own—to create another film that deserves to stand alongside them."
The World's End,7,26004851,58,"The movie independently bungles everything it tries, like a Central Park busker who simultaneously sucks at juggling, harmonica playing and skateboarding."
Innerspace,6.8,25893810,100,"It doesn't have the dark edge of Joe Dante's other works, but brilliant performances by Martin Short and Meg Ryan make it a joy from start to finish."
Innerspace,6.8,25893810,80,"The plot is standard fantasy-adventure pulp, though director Joe Dante (Gremlins, Explorers) has so many screwball things going on in it that the comedy all but overwhelms the formulaic line of action."
Innerspace,6.8,25893810,80,"I would have loved to eavesdrop on the script conferences for ""Innerspace."" Here is an absurd, unwieldy, overplotted movie that nevertheless is entertaining - and some of the fun comes from the way the plot keeps laying it on."
Innerspace,6.8,25893810,80,"Quaid is engagingly reckless and gung-ho as the pioneer into a new dimension, although he is physically constrained in his little capsule for most of the running time. Short has infinitely more possibilities and makes the most of them, coming into his own as a screen personality as a mild-mannered little guy who rises to an extraordinary situation."
Innerspace,6.8,25893810,75,"The film is never inspired; it's not imaginative enough to be any more than an entertainingly good time. But it's an enormously unassuming, likable comedy, and surprisingly uninsistent for a big summer entertainment."
Innerspace,6.8,25893810,75,"It takes great confidence to think of a second film before the first is even finished; either that, or it takes great nerve. In any case, Innerspace, which opens today at the Criterion and other theaters, has all the brashness of a hit, if not all the luster."
Innerspace,6.8,25893810,75,"While the anatomical special effects are imaginative enough, the manic rather than magical tone fails to achieve the sense of awe that made Fantastic Voyage - clearly this film's inspiration - so fascinating."
Innerspace,6.8,25893810,70,"Formulaic fun, helped by two winning leads."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,63,"Director Rob Cohen shoots believable action sequences, too. Nobody jumps the gap between skyscrapers or falls 40 feet, then gets up and runs away."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,60,"Rebooting novelist James Patterson's famous Alex Cross character for the big screen, Tyler Perry aims at new cinematic territory and scores a bullseye as the Detroit detective embroiled in a hunt for a mega-evil killer that turns personal."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,50,"Alex Cross isn't meant to be analyzed too deeply. The title character probably sums up the best strategy for appreciating the film's modest pleasures when he says, ""Don't overthink it; I'm just looking for a bad guy."""
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,50,"There is one thing interesting about Alex Cross, and if you miss this, you've missed the whole movie. It's not the story - it's worse than mediocre. It's not the lead actor - nothing wrong with Tyler Perry, but as an action star he's no Vin Diesel. And it's not the dialogue, which has a clunker every other scene. It's the direction. Notice the direction. Alex Cross is a good example of what a seriously talented director can do with a heaping pile of garbage."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,50,"Alex Cross is filled with accidental comedy, and while it's a mess in any traditional movie sense, it's has its moments of preposterous fun that come in the form of a nonsensical plot and a fabulously competent, scenery-gnawing villain."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,50,"There's nothing in Alex Cross that argues another installment is warranted, but much will depend on whether Tyler Perry's audience crosses over and continues to follow him in this new, very different role."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,50,"Where Freeman was warm but enigmatic, Perry is warm but empty."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,50,"The sharpest five minutes in Alex Cross, by a considerable margin, belong to Giancarlo Esposito."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,50,A disjointed thriller with two many characters rattling around.
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,50,"Perry must have felt it was high time for him to try his hand at playing a darker role. But starring in this badly directed, suspense-free film with its unintentionally laughable dialogue does Perry no favors."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,40,"Miscast and underwritten, Alex Cross does not reinvent Tyler Perry, or James Patterson's character, or anything, really. The only appeal here is the sick kick of watching a franchise blow itself to bloody stumps."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,40,"The resulting film, despite its occasional outbursts of action and tension, is less an action film than a psychological thriller, although even there it fumbles the ball."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,40,"It neglects, for one thing, to make any sense."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,40,It's a strange sort of film that casts Gallic tough guy Jean Reno as a clean-fingernailed mogul while employing cross-dressing comic Tyler Perry as a guy capable of hand-to-hand combat with someone called The Butcher of Sligo.
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,40,"Though they lack chemistry as a team, it's gratifying to see both Perry and Burns stretching in ways they haven't before."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,40,"You almost feel sorry for Tyler Perry, stepping out of his own universe for the first time to try to expand his range and finding himself in something as thoroughly dismal as Alex Cross."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,40,"Aside from these curious role reversals, though, Alex Cross is a mess. Drawing on every conceivable '80s B-movie action cliché and treating its beleaguered female characters like pieces of meat (literally, in one scene of butchery), director Rob Cohen squanders a surprisingly recognizable cast on a half-baked plot adapted from James Patterson's series of novels."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,38,"Nothing works. Or some of it works, but that doesn't matter because what's working is so deeply, painfully boring."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,38,"Perry shifts into full-on badass mode... well, the best that can be said is that he's sincere. For all that, he's still less embarrassing than Lost's Matthew Fox, likewise cast against type as the film's sadistic villain."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,33,"There's not a moment in Alex Cross that doesn't function splendidly as comedy. Which means that for all his cool-cat preening and heroic soul-searching, Tyler Perry must have felt right at home."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,30,What a whorish film this is: Even the serial killer lectures the detective.
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,30,"It's a courageous but misguided move on Perry's part; he has none of Freeman's soulful, nuanced subtlety, and watching him display the gamut of emotions called for in Marc Moss and Kerry Williamson's script is like watching the Hulk attempt Swan Lake."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,30,"In the face of such junk, the idea that Fox would proudly put himself on a punishing regime of severe diet and exercise to get prisoner-skinny-yet-crazy-muscled for the job of make-believe is vanity at best, obscenity at worst."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,25,"Instead of playing the role in drag, the erstwhile Madea simply is a drag."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,25,Alex Cross is slipshod cinema hoping to capitalize on a star out of his orbit here.
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,25,Formulaic serial-killer crapola.
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,25,"In drag or out of it, the soft-spoken star has rarely been less convincing than when locking and loading from his home arsenal or dangling from a decaying Detroit edifice."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,20,"A grim, dispiritingly stupid waste of time, energy, money and talent."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,20,"The best of the Alex Cross mess suggests that as an actor, he has the talent to move beyond the world of Madea should he want to. He just needs to look for much better material."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,20,"The cross-dressing ""Madea"" star seems out of his depth playing the hard-boiled detective made famous by Morgan Freeman in ""Along Came a Spider"" and ""Kiss the Girls."" Even action helmer Rob Cohen (""The Fast and the Furious,"" ""XXX"") seems to be off his game here."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,20,"The movie is stunningly perfunctory, soul-crushingly oblivious to its own lack of originality, and, to be blunt, just plain dumb."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,16,"Alex Cross is more boring than your average weeknight procedural, except much longer, dumber and more violent."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,16,"Expositional and often self-serious to the point of genuine awkwardness, the dialogue is never as haltingly unconvincing as when it's attempting to give some approximation of Alex Cross's essential looseness and good humor."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,89,This is horror with a wink and a nod to drive-in theatres and sweaty back seats. This is how it's done.
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,80,"A deliriously trashy, exuberantly vulgar, lavishly appointed exploitation picture, this weird combo of road-kill movie and martial-arts vampire gorefest is made to order for the stimulation of teenage boys."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,75,"It's great fun, but certainly not great art."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,75,"Imagine two movies...The first is a moody thriller about two brothers who pull off a bank job, take a family hostage, and head for Mexico. The second is a garish horror freak-out. The deranged hook of From Dusk Till Dawn is that it starts out as the first movie and turns, on a dime, into the second."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,70,"Mr. Rodriguez demonstrates his talents more clearly than ever -- he's visually inventive, quick-witted and a fabulous editor -- while still hampering himself with sophomoric material."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,70,"The movie's horror-comics second half is cheesy, derivative, and ultimately a little wearying. But it's also unpretentious and insanely cheerful."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,60,"Robert Rodriguez's second effort is a funny, craftily written piece of low-grade horror crapola."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,60,"On a mindless exploitation level this is pretty good, but on other levels it seems to make promises that it fails to deliver on; none of the deaths carries any moral weight, and the climactic special-effects free-for-all tends to drown out all other interests."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,60,Rodriguez's film is a high-octane fun-house ride with only one speed: sick-making.
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,50,"Spiritually it's a John Woo-George Romero-Jim Thompson picture, outrageously bloody and weird."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,50,"Plenty of surprises, almost all of them nasty."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,40,"George Clooney is the best reason to submit yourself to From Dusk Till Dawn, an exceedingly grotesque thriller-horror-comedy that fails to live up to the promise of its opening reels."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,10,It's a triumph of vile over content; mindless nihilism posing as hipness.
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,10,"A plodding, aggressive film that is neither engaging, disturbing nor funny."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,0,"Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez had their fun with From Dusk Till Dawn, and now they need to stay away from each other. For their own good. Forever."
Desperado,7.2,25625110,100,"Take nothing seriously - not the action, not the gore, not the plot, not the theme. Instead, view Desperado as it's meant to be seen - a comedy - and you're in for an unalloyed treat; heck, you're in for one of the funniest flicks of the year."
Desperado,7.2,25625110,89,A bust-a-gut film experience that reveals Rodriguez as both a stylist versed in the mechanics of popular storytelling and a maverick whose ingenuity guides him along a singular path.
Desperado,7.2,25625110,80,"The commercial transition has been remarkably successful. This is primarily thanks to Rodriguez, who not only retains the original movie's kinetic flair, but takes it further."
Desperado,7.2,25625110,75,The camera loves Banderas -- a velvet stud -- as much as it did the young Clint Eastwood.
Desperado,7.2,25625110,75,The stunts dazzle until you miss the low-key charm and cost-conscious inventiveness of the original. Desperado is best when Rodriguez lets his playful side cut through the blare of a born filmmaker indulging his first chance at high-end Hollywood fireworks.
Desperado,7.2,25625110,63,"During this movie, every few moments the theater fills with the appreciative guffaws of 18-year-old young men. How old are you?"
Desperado,7.2,25625110,60,"Unquestionably formulaic but mercifully free of the flat dialogue and arch one-liners that undermine so many action films. And while it lacks ""El Mariachi's"" naive charm, it's far funnier."
Desperado,7.2,25625110,60,"What's mainly missing is the sort of conviction and passion that gave El mariachi its charge; one feels at almost every moment that Rodriguez is fulfilling a contract rather than saying something he has to say. There's a lot of panache here, but not much inspiration."
Desperado,7.2,25625110,50,"I was pleased again and again by set-ups, camera angles, lighting effects, editing rhythms and the fanciful staging of action scenes. But I never for a moment cared about the characters, and the plot was all too conveniently structured - just a guideline to the action."
Desperado,7.2,25625110,50,"The real problem with Desperado, however, is that this sequel is without purpose and may be the most unnecessary follow-up since the second ""Crocodile Dundee."""
Desperado,7.2,25625110,50,"Search for some independent inspiration, and you'll be looking for a long time."
Desperado,7.2,25625110,50,Mostly just another exercise in snappy editing and over-the-top mayhem that will leave most grown-up movie- goers cold.
Desperado,7.2,25625110,50,"What fun there is derives from the smart editing (Rodriguez did his own cutting, and he's quicker on the draw than most of the pistol-packers) and from Antonio Banderas, who, stepping neatly into the Mariachi's boots, lends irony and calm, and even a trace of sweetness, to a nothing role."
Desperado,7.2,25625110,50,"Desperado also has some entertaining twists, some sexy goings-on, but on the whole, watching the film is about as much fun as sitting on a cactus."
Desperado,7.2,25625110,40,"Could scarcely be more dazzling on a purely visual level, but it's mortally anemic in the story, character and thematic departments."
Desperado,7.2,25625110,40,"Like ""The Quick and the Dead,"" Desperado wavers uneasily between myth making and parody, so that too many scenes drag on long after they've lost their punch."
Desperado,7.2,25625110,40,"A weakly comic splatter movie oversupplied with jokey, cartoonish violence."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,100,"As challenging as it must have been to pilot Joss Whedon's space opera from the TV junk pile to the big screen, the finished product is a triumph."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,91,"If you think the ""Star Wars"" prequels are a disease, then Serenity is the cure."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,90,"This is a film that exists because of fans, was written for the fans and yet can be enjoyed by just about anyone willing to have a good time."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,90,Serenity is a trim little picture of epic proportions.
Serenity,7.9,25514517,88,"A brash, funny, action-packed bit of sci-fi ecstasy--and a giant raspberry to the execs who let ""Firefly"" fall out of the sky."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,88,"Whedon wants to make a Serenity trilogy, and I suspect the actors will grow on me if he does. In this case, familiarity would breed not contempt but comfort."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,"Serenity is still taut, immersive, and alternately hilarious and heartbreaking, a well-balanced blend of whooping Wild West action and space opera."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,"It's but a witty, engaging hodgepodge of archetypes and clichés; it retreads not only the TV show's story lines, but also those of every ""Star Trek"" and ""Gunsmoke"" episode. It needed the room of a big screen just to fit all of its influences into a single place."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,A highly entertaining piece of genre-blending fun.
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,"No matter what's coming their way, post-apocalyptic doom or gloom, this James Gang of the galaxy is just plain fun to watch."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,"A sci-fi saga that manages to be at once stirring and screwball, gut-busting and gut-wrenching, and more fun than you had at any bigger-budget movie this past summer."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,"If you're a novice, this is a plucky introduction to Whedon's world and the most fun sci-fi of the year. If you're a devotee, this is the magnificent return you've been praying for."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,78,"Serenity evinces the kind of swashbuckling bonhomie that made so many of us fall in love with the original ""Star Wars"" films, a love that was mightily tested by George Lucas' humorless prequels."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Jaw set but never stiff, he (Fillion) gets both the Whedon wit and the Whedon grandiloquence between cheek and gum, and gives the whole enterprise the heft of a real saga."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Serenity is made of dubious but energetic special effects, breathless velocity, much imagination, some sly verbal wit and a little political satire."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Serenity shows what might have happened if Han Solo had been the focus of the original ""Star Wars"" instead of whiny Jedi wannabe Luke Skywalker."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Although Mal is ostensibly the movie's hero, and River its heroine, Whedon does a good job of giving all onboard their own story arc, their tragedies and triumphs. The cast, to a man (and woman), is solid, although it's the ballet-trained Glau, who gets to mope in high angst and go Zhang Ziyi-crazy in a couple of martial-arts scenes, who steals the show."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"The film's strength is compelling character relationships and Whedon's trademark dialogue, a smarter version of the cliched action-movie barrage of wisecrack under fire, only better executed, laden in personality, and enriched with evocative western colloquialisms of a frontier culture."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"It features truly monstrous bogeymen in the Reavers, cannibalistic renegades who, legend has it, went to the edge of the universe and were driven mad by the abyss."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Serenity may be short on exposition, but it's smart and fun."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"While it's a geek's paradise from scene one, newcomers are likely to feel left out until they get their bearings.  Fortunately, Whedon's characteristic humanity, coupled with the slyest sense of humor in Hollywood, greatly eases the transition."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"After witnessing the wearying parliamentary debates among good and bad senators in recent Star Wars episodes, it's a pleasure to watch a sci-fi movie where more than just the spaceships move quickly."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"A fast-paced, engaging science fiction adventure tale."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Serenity may not be the next ""Star Wars,"" but it's the best we've seen since the original trilogy, and if Wheedon is planning Serenity trilogy (the door is left open), it would certainly be welcome."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,"What makes Serenity refreshing is its avoidance of CGI, which gives the pic a much more human dimension; the evident chemistry between the cast; and a humor that doesn't rely simply on flip one-liners."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,"Though richly allegorical, Serenity also works as a rousing and unabashedly manipulative adventure that never takes itself too seriously."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,"Scene for scene, Serenity is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas's recent screen entertainments."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,"An appealingly low-rent, if not earth-shattering, 26th century ""Star Wars"" with faint glimmers of ""Blade Runner,"" ""Buckaroo Banzai"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" for good measure."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,"Chiwetel Ejiofor (Dirty Pretty Things) is the sinister operative dispatched to retrieve the ship's psychic passenger, who as played by Summer Glau kickboxes better than Maggie Cheung and Zhang Ziyi combined."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,I mean Serenity no disrespect when I say it's enjoyably junky.
Serenity,7.9,25514517,63,"For folks like me, who missed ""Firefly,"" the short-lived TV show on which the movie's based, watching Serenity is like showing up for a big lecture course at the end of the semester. And yet, after an hour of intense disorientation, the movie's arch sarcasm becomes oddly entertaining."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,50,"It's the zippy chatter among the Serenity's wised-up space pirates that gives the film most of its punch, but with only serviceable action sequences and largely cookie-cutter effects, you can still sense the void just outside."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,50,"The dialogue, delivered mostly in Southern accents, is intended to be funny and fresh, but much of this Western-influenced sci-fi adventure story feels reheated."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,50,"If you can't be original, why not borrow from something no one has seen, like Ben Affleck's last five movies?"
The Great Race,7.3,25333333,75,"It's highly inventive, self-conscious camp, made in 1965, well before the genre wore itself out in superciliousness."
The Great Race,7.3,25333333,75,"While many of the jokes don't pay off, it's still funny enough to merit your attention. Mancini's score adds pace and flow. This spectacle is almost totally uncontrolled, and therein lies much of its charm."
The Great Race,7.3,25333333,70,"The Great Race is a big, expensive, whopping, comedy extravaganza [from a screen story by Blake Edwards and Arthur Ross], long on slapstick and near-inspired tomfoolery whose tongue-in-cheek treatment liberally sprinkled with corn frequently garners belly laughs."
The Great Race,7.3,25333333,70,"Natalie Wood is on hand as a cheroot-smoking suffragist (with a phenomenal wardrobe), but the movie is largely powered by Lemmon’s energy, roaring like Jackie Gleason as the bombastic Professor Fate and later appearing as his double, the klutzy crown prince of a Ruritanian kingdom."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,88,"The best movie Steven Seagal never made. Except that Statham, while just as marked for death, is harder to kill."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,83,Immensely exciting and funny.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,80,A poke in the adrenal gland -- obeys the first law of action movie-making by quickening the heart and dazzling the eye.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,80,A thoroughly satisfying mix of mayhem and mindless fun.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,75,"Kinetic, meaningless and fun."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,75,"There's plenty to like here, especially for connoisseurs of the action genre, and there's also plenty to make you wonder whether Besson and co-writer Robert Mark Kamen scribbled their screenplay on a batch of Marseilles cocktail napkins and then lost one or two."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,70,This is a film where there isn't the slightest doubt about the dramatic outcome. But the marketing will be a cliffhanger.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,63,"Cut above this genre's usual industrial sludge, even when the chops and kicks are too fast to follow."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,63,"Too much action brings the movie to a dead standstill. Why don't directors understand that? Why don't they know that wall-to-wall action makes a movie less interesting -- less like drama, more like a repetitive video game?"
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,63,"This balls-to-the-walls action/adventure makes the average James Bond film look like something by Eric Rohmer. It’s high rent Steven Segal - fights, explosions, and more fights, but with a flair."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,63,"The plot doesn't rate as high as the quality of the bodies in fast, furious motion. What counts in The Transporter isn't the wafer-thin story about smugglers -- it's the way Martin kicks open a door, fends off a couple of axes and uses a perfectly ordinary sport shirt as a weapon."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,60,Entertaining but forgettable action flick.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,60,"What's most disappointing is the almost utter lack of humor --  In the mindless action sweepstakes, however, there's still enough here to place The Transporter above big-bang gibberish like XXX."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,60,Will Statham make it as an action hero? Hard to say. His personality makes Vin Diesel look positively debonair.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,58,"A slick, sexy little package with fast cars, big explosions, dazzling locations in the south of France, a trip-hop score, and about as much plot to fill a thimble."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,50,"Sadly, the last 40-odd minutes are essentially one fight, pushed to the point of absurdity."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,50,"Sreams its devotion to style over substance with slick action sequences, fast cars and breathtaking stunts."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,50,"Another big, dumb action movie in the vein of ""XXX,"" The Transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW through."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,50,"Muddles through as a film so uninterested in character, it doesn't bother assigning names to them."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,50,"If anything, The Transporter isn't ludicrous enough; only one scene (a hand-to-hand showdown in the middle of an oil slick) reaches the inspired, delirious comic heights of the best Hong Kong movies."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,40,So second-hand and disposable is it in every respect.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,40,American audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,40,It's like the worst movie Jean-Claude Van Damme never made.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,33,It takes perverse genius to make an action film this stupid.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,20,"Kills time between car chases and martial-arts bouts with random scuba-diving footage apparently culled from producer–co-writer Luc Besson's ""The Big Blue."""
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,20,"That the movie becomes silly isn't necessarily a problem, but it also becomes tiresome, degenerating into a series of martial arts interludes -- everyone unaccountably leaves his guns at home."
Escape from New York,7.2,25244700,100,"It's a toughly told, very tall tale, one of the best escape (and escapist) movies of the season."
Escape from New York,7.2,25244700,100,"The pleasures are right in your face, beginning with the million-dollar idea of turning NYC into a walled-off prison where criminals run free. Even born-and-raised New Yorkers (of which Carpenter was decidedly not) could smile at that histrionic setup; it’s an outsider’s joke made funny by our willingness to be entertained."
Escape from New York,7.2,25244700,90,"It has got an intriguing premise, an effective cast, and it has been expertly mounted."
Escape from New York,7.2,25244700,80,"Boasting one of the most iconic characters ever in Plissken, and an effective sci-fi set-up, this is entertainment of the highest order."
Escape from New York,7.2,25244700,80,"Carpenter's grittily convincing New York-in-decay remains the film's best element. Never particularly suspenseful and hampered by a finale that almost literally steers the plot toward a dead end, Escape only intermittently finds Carpenter flexing his directorial muscles. But it may be his most visionary film: Escape allowed him to build a future out of scraps from the past."
Escape from New York,7.2,25244700,80,"A generally gripping actioner, the film can also be read as a percipient satire of a society irreparably split along lines of class and race."
Escape from New York,7.2,25244700,75,"Although execution doesn’t quite live up to the fabulous premise, Escape from New York is a solidly satisfying actioner."
Escape from New York,7.2,25244700,70,"Escape from New York isn't really science fiction -- it's an action flick set in a futuristic setting. Epic potential for a masterful, gripping tale is abandoned in favor of cheap thrills."
Escape from New York,7.2,25244700,63,"For about half the film, Carpenter's narrative economy and explosive visual style (incorporating some marvellous model work of the new Manhattan skyline) promise wonders. The trouble is that his characters neither develop nor interact dynamically, so the plot gradually winds down into predictable though highly enjoyable histrionics."
Escape from New York,7.2,25244700,60,"The movie is never less than entertaining, but it fails to satisfy—it gives us too little of too much. Oddly, much of its pleasure is in the acting, which up to this point hadn't been Carpenter's strong suit: Donald Pleasence, Adrienne Barbeau, and Harry Dean Stanton offer excellent turns."
Alien Nation,6.3,25216243,63,"Eventually, though it happens later rather than sooner, the conventional aspects of Alien Nation overwhelm the novelty."
Alien Nation,6.3,25216243,60,"Solid performances by leads James Caan and his humanoid buddy-cop partner Mandy Patinkin move this production beyond special effects, clever alien makeup and car chases."
Alien Nation,6.3,25216243,60,"Alien Nation is a sluggish, forced and hopelessly derivative action thriller, sporadically redeemed by the wit of its stars and the velvety sheen of Greenberg's night photography."
Alien Nation,6.3,25216243,50,"There are, thankfully, a few humorous and imaginative touches here and there, but Alien Nation is hardly inspired."
Alien Nation,6.3,25216243,50,"The movie is simply a failure of imagination. Nobody looked at the screenplay and observed that it didn’t try hard enough, that it had no surprises, that it didn’t attempt to delight its audiences with twists and turns on the phoned-in plotline."
Alien Nation,6.3,25216243,50,"Alien Nation wants to be ""In the Heat of the Night"" as science fiction, but it's neither morally instructive nor prophetic. It proves a lumbering marriage of action and sci-fi that alienates both audiences. It's too dull for one and too dumb for the other."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,75,So chalk Escape Plan up as a pretty good action movie given an extra edge by the intelligent use of its two main actors.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,75,"Though this movie can’t match the formal qualities that made the pair’s most iconic films work, it goes a long way toward recapturing their sense of cheesy fun."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,70,"With its fun script and cheap visuals, Escape Plan evokes the halfwit cheesiness of 1980s-era Cannon films, but it also recalls the deft pacing and legibility of their action sequences."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,70,"Here are two action stars having fun; watching them work together as a team is a lot more entertaining than you might have expected. Try not to think too hard about it, and Escape Plan is stupid, stupid fun."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,68,A Stallone / Schwarzenegger film that isn't completely beneath them.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,67,"Escape Plan is so dumb it's adorable, as any movie pitting Sylvester Stallone's grunt against Arnold Schwarzenegger's accent should be."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,63,A display of old-school muscle-buddy connivance that’s as flatly preposterous as it is shamelessly entertaining.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,63,The heist-inspired elements aren't well thought through and it becomes a question of which is harder to swallow: the mechanics of the story or the idea that a couple of sixtysomethings can kick this much ass.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,63,Stupid but fun.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,63,Any prison-break yarn that includes Arnold Schwarzenegger delivering the line “You hit like a vegetarian” is OK by me.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"The script never gives them the kind of memorable exchange that makes fans howl with delight. But all in all, Escape Plan does what it sets out to do."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"Escape Plan is mostly a gray, thudding metal machine of throwback exploitation, but the goateed, goofy Ah-nold is so happy to be in the thick of an old-school bruiser again that he makes it feel like the dumb-fun flashback party it is."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"No new ground is broken, and viewers will, not unpleasantly, get everything they expect. It’s apparently morning in America again."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"As the unpredictable, mischievous inmate with the unlikely name of Emil Rottmayer, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s sidekick role in Escape Plan may make audiences weep for the films we missed out on while he made speeches in Sacramento."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"Stallone and Schwarzenegger have all the gravity here, and keep pulling Escape Plan in the direction of an old-fashioned tough-guy action film, one filled with nods to their onscreen pasts and offscreen exploits."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"Mercifully free of tongue-in-cheek meta-humor, Escape Plan is a likably lunkheaded meat-and-potatoes brawler that never pretends to be more sophisticated than it is."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"A highly enjoyable slice of in-one-eye, out-the-other nonsense. It may coast on the charisma of its leads at times, and it’s hardly deep, but there’s a Friday night to be had."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"Schwarzenegger, for one, seems to be having a hoot."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"The plot itself is predictably divorced from reality, containing more holes — and smelling staler — than month-old Swiss cheese.  All of which means that Stallone and Schwarzenegger end up having to do all the heavy lifting."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"Sure, it’s fun to see the Governator and the Italian Stallion he-manning it up together feature-length for the first time — the screen is barely big enough to contain the two of them — but the prison-break movie Escape Plan is unworthy of the momentous occasion."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"Action fans -- particularly devotees of brainless '80s shoot-em-ups -- may find enough to like here, particularly the preposterous mayhem of the third act."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"In one amusing bit of dialogue, Stallone and Schwarze-negger kid each other about being smarter than they look. For a little while at least, we thought we might be able to say the same about Escape Plan."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"The tempered violence, the nature of the villains, the easy bonhomie of our leads and a cast peppered with great supporting players make Escape Plan go down easier than the other “Rambo/Last Man Standing/Expendables” pictures that brought these two aged action stars back from the dead."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,40,"It won't stick to your ribs in the way, say, a shank will -- but it probably won't leave you looking for a way to escape the theater, either."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,40,It’s not fair to either of these actors to want to see Rocky and the Terminator over and over again. But it is fair to want to see them in something better than this.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,40,"With a tighter plot and slightly more knowing craftsmanship, this might have worked, but Swedish director Mikael Hafström (1408, The Rite) isn’t really the man to poke fun with any sophistication at his stars’ well-established personas."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,40,"Escape Pla’ would have made a perfect vehicle for, say, a Chuck Norris or even a Jean-Claude Van Damme. But these two redoubtable, enormously watchable old-school heroes deserve better."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,40,"For a long stretch of the second act the film feels like doing a long stretch, but Schwarzenegger’s having a ball as Stallone goes through the motions."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,38,"Yeah, it's a mishmash of good, strange ideas and generic nonsense, barely held together by Sly and Arnie."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,33,"Escape Plan deserves some credit for gradually rising from abysmal to almost-mediocre, though it’s needlessly complicated in every step of the way."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,30,"The film is eventful and full of suspense, but also obvious and completely contrived."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,30,"They just don't make 'em like this anymore, and it's a good thing, too."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,25,"A dim anti-privatization parable that preaches a familiar strain of cynical, unchallenged self-righteousness in the face of widespread abuse of civil liberties."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,80,"A macho, adrenaline-fix suspenser that plays like the bigscreen equivalent of those pulpy spy novels that once clogged grocery-store checkouts."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,75,"This is actually a pretty good thriller, based more on character and plot than on action for its own sake. The need to construct killings that look like accidents adds to the interest."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,70,"This muscular thriller--led by Jason Statham, Clive Owen and Robert De Niro--strives to be a genuinely good film, but unwilling to let go of proven formulas, it falls short."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,63,"Killer Elite is pleasurable enough, but with a steadier hand, it could've been one for the books."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,63,"A snarly Euro-thriller with crust under its fingernails and bad breath. It doesn't care if you like it, which is why I kind of do."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,63,"Despite having a perfect cast for a title like Killer Elite, Gary McKendry's feature debut comes across as little more than a generic Jason Statham movie with two high-profile guest stars."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,63,"Best of all, the filmmakers took the time to give these hard men just the right things to say - not catchphrases, just lines that smell of blood and gunpowder every time Statham, Owen or DeNiro utter them."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,60,"It's a generically enjoyable action film with a bit of hardboiled based-on-a-true-story-ness about it, and since it's set in the '80s and feels like an '80s movie, it seems a lot like something you must have seen years ago."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,60,"If you're willing to accept Killer Elite as a shoot-'em-up action movie with good actors taking the spots of the usual lunk heads (but spouting the usual nonsense), you'll be pleased with the film."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,58,"De Niro, in what amounts to an extended cameo, is radically miscast. That's still no excuse for his nonperformance, which is beyond lackluster."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,55,"The picture, the debut feature of Irish director Gary McKendry, is rote and joyless, an exercise in disposability."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,50,Killer Elite's major problem: motion at the expense of emotion.
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,50,"Loaded with careening car chases and rooftop runs, glass-shattering shootouts and exploding fireballs, Killer Elite offers more than enough to keep action junkies happy."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,50,Killer Elite is based on a true story and about a half-dozen Jason Statham movies.
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,50,"The script is a mess. It's an object lesson in taking a nonfiction book (""The Feather Men,"" about a cadre of ex-British Special Air Service operatives) and making a hash of it."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,50,"Killer Elite is too formulaic to overcome a been-there, done-that feel."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,50,Killer Elite pretends to be fact-based and true to its 1980s period. Just know it's all baloney.
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,40,"There's nothing here for the viewer to do, no kinks to work out, no double-crossings to anticipate, not even a half-hearted flail at figuring out how Danny ticks."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,40,"A few good stunts, some tolerable brooding and one nice, if silly desert chase. But not essential."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,40,"When Robert De Niro, Clive Owen and Jason Statham unite for an action thriller, we should be able to expect something special. Or at least memorable. Instead, Killer Elite gives us ordinary."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,40,"Killer Elite is distinguished by one no-mercy, eye-gouging, testicle-punching brawl, and one whoppingly indifferent screenplay."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,40,"A few awesome firefights does not an action film make, and even De Niro's Ronin-esque interlude can't shake the feeling that the thrill, like the '80s, is gone."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,38,I've got another portmanteau word for the movie: unbelievaballistic.
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,33,"This clumsy action movie feels too generic to be real. The film attempts to add an element of sophisticated sociopolitical commentary to the typical Jason Statham head-busting shoot-'em-up, but only ends up draining it of visceral thrills."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,30,"We all have to make jokes around the water cooler, and if enough people bother to see Killer Elite, its silly nonsense could make for a great comedy routine by Greg from IT."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,30,"Pure punishment, this rote action flick from Australia."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,25,"Director-co-writer Gary McKendry seems to know a thing or two about hard-fisted fight scenes, but he muddies up the visuals with obligatory spasms of shaky-cam."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,25,"Killing looks ridiculously easy in this dispensable exploitation picture, directed for maximum impact of head-cracking pain by ad-trained Irish director Gary McKendry in his first feature."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,20,"Whatever the case, Mr. Owen and Mr. Statham (who provides a nice duet with a chair) make a prettily matched pair amid the pileup of sub-Bourne action set pieces, sad laughs and clichés."
Against All Odds,5.9,25100000,80,"Against All Odds is so lively and enjoyable on its own terms that its genre problems, while real, are easily overlooked. Mr. Hackford's brand of glossy, romantic escapism doesn't have to work as an homage. It has a vitality of its own."
Against All Odds,5.9,25100000,75,"There is a lot of plot in this movie - probably too much. The best thing to do is to accept the plot, and then disregard it, and pay attention to the scenes of passion. They really work."
Against All Odds,5.9,25100000,70,"If not for a somewhat murky and misanthropic ending, Against All Odds would stand as a well-engineered second-try at 1947's ""Out of the Past."""
Against All Odds,5.9,25100000,50,"This is about as noir as Pete’s Dragon, best to accept its superficiality as a boon - Hackford, at least, gives it a slick exterior - and enjoy it is a vacuous thriller and extended Phil Collins video."
Against All Odds,5.9,25100000,40,Little remains of the original but its weakest element - its overelaborate intrigue - and Hackford seems only to scramble it further.
Against All Odds,5.9,25100000,40,"Not even a bravura performance from Woods, some steamy love scenes between Bridges and Ward, and a thrilling daylight car chase down Sunset Boulevard can pull this confusing remake out of the doldrums."
Against All Odds,5.9,25100000,30,"The result is a flat, dumbly brutal movie, full of overplotted complexity and empty of all emotional resonance, except that provided by the presence of Jane Greer (the original film's dark lady, here doing a supporting role) and Richard Widmark."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,78,"Director Howard, his actors, and indeed the entire salty sweep of the film are all aided tremendously by visual-effects supervisor Jody Johnson and his team’s spectacular combination of live action and flawless, awe-inspiring CGI creations, chief among them the great, white whale."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,75,"In the Heart of the Sea really gives Hemsworth a chance to shine. He’s not just the hammer-slinging Thor: The Aussie continues to make the most of his dramatic work — as in Howard’s 2013 Formula 1 film ""Rush"" — and showcases a considerable amount of gravitas."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,75,"The biggest problem with In the Heart of the Sea is its episodic nature. Especially during the post-sinking saga, things don’t flow smoothly."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,75,"Even though In The Heart Of The Sea’s framing device often feels like it was written by someone who’d never read a word of Melville, its visual style makes for a bold approximation of his allusive prose."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,70,"The picture is sometimes wayward and unwieldy, its dialogue creaky and awkward, like an amateur’s attempt at scrimshaw.... But in a movie climate rife with superhero reboots and rehashings of childhood favorites, it’s a small marvel that In the Heart of the Sea exists at all."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,67,In the Heart of the Sea doesn't trust itself enough to be great.
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,67,"Howard’s film, for all of its storytelling skill, technical polish, and rousing high-seas sequences, never quite casts the spell it should. It’s too polite to give us a real feeling of life or death. Its sense of danger is watered down."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,63,"The whale special effects, computer-generated of course, are genuinely spectacular."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,63,"Only landlubbers would resist the rousing action of man versus leviathan. Sure it's old-school. So what. Howard puts heart, soul and every computerized whale trick in the book into crafting a seafaring adventure to rock your boat."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,63,An oddly uninvolving adventure story.
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,63,"Howard’s In the Heart of the Sea merely unravels the yarn that inspired the great book, a good-looking film that never sinks, but never really soars either."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,60,"Despite the best efforts of the filmmakers, In the Heart of the Sea is a few knots away from being the transformative cinema experience intended."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,60,The images are impressive. But the characters and their development leave something to be desired.
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,60,"The dramatic scenes are a touch overcooked, and there are moments when it feels like a particularly high-end school play, with everyone shouting “Avast!” and “Ahoy!” like they really mean it. The action, though, is consistently impressive: When man and beast go toe-to-tail, your timbers will be truly well shivered."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,60,"Howard is great at capturing the timbre of the ship, the creaks and snaps and the whir of the hemp lines, and the sonar clicks of the whales strategizing below. All his sound and fury has a befuddling purpose. His emotional climax is about, well, disaster insurance."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,60,"Fluid, shifting and tense, the action here easily outstrips the film’s basic set-up (man tests himself against nature, is humbled), which can feel like unconvincing filler between surges of effects work."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,60,There’s so much incident crammed into this tale of misfortune that there’s never quite enough time to truly tangle with the sheets and sails of its meaning.
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,60,"Given the weighty themes of Moby Dick, In The Heart Of The Sea doesn't have a lot going on behind the outward action. The composite parts are in fine working order; it's the sum that's slightly lacking."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,60,"Director Ron Howard does a solid job of getting the smell of salt off the page and into the picture. The first half works quite well simply as a procedural, but when the action comes we run into trouble. The well-earned seriousness is washed away as we’re broadsided by B-movie tropes."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,58,"If the movie accomplishes nothing else, though, I hope it inspires the curious to actually sit down and finally read “Moby-Dick.” It’s an extraordinary yarn. Really."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"The conversion to 3-D has left the movie looking grim and dim. Almost every scene, whether indoors by candlelight or upon the open ocean, seems awkwardly dark; competent 3-D effects don’t compensate for this distraction. Equally drab are the performances, except for Gleeson and Whishaw."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,At the heart of the problem with this period piece is an absence of a riveting scene or a memorable slice of dialogue.
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"Overall, it is false, both narratively and visually, in a way that just doesn't sit right with me, and it feels like a lesser effort from Howard, an itch he scratched but that hold little interest for anyone else."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"If you want a Ron Howard movie about a man obsessed with a creature from the deep, In the Heart of the Sea, sadly, is not the place to start. Try “Splash.”"
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"And this is ultimately what damages In the Heart of the Sea more than anything else: it is so very many different things, but they all feel detached from each other, almost like a bunch of self-contained mini-movies stitched end-to-end, with the framing device serving as needle and thread."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,The whale is wondrous but the drama not so much in In the Heart of the Sea.
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"As the movie lurches along by fits and starts, toggling between the little Nantucket room and the great watery world, it becomes apparent that the filmmakers have no idea how to reconcile not just two parallel stories but also the past and our contemporary age."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"It’s a tentative, half-realized tale that ultimately suffers from a significant identity crisis."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"With In the Heart of the Sea, director Ron Howard has given us a painstakingly crafted bore, a lovingly rendered snooze, and a very expensive means by which audiences can experience restless leg syndrome before being carted off to the land of happy slumber."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"I wish Howard's film had more of a distinct personality and drive behind it; Howard's made some supremely enjoyable films, in various keys, but this waterlogged, effects-crazed picture isn't one of them."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"You come away from the movie lamenting the missed opportunity and wondering what a stronger, bolder filmmaker would have done with this material."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"There are aspects afloat reminiscent of the great 1946 sea epic ""Two Years Before the Mast"", but  Chris Hemsworth is no Alan Ladd. He is to the majesty of a ship at sea what a clamshell is to the bottom of a canoe."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"Visual daring is nice, but it means little in the end when the ultimately safe and harmless story never rocks the boat."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"A sort of maritime Donner Party, In the Heart of the Sea is a rugged but underwhelming true-life drama of a cursed 19th century whaling voyage."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,45,"Lovers of spectacle for spectacle’s sake will come away from the film with many discrete sequences to admire, but there’s not enough of a human element to bridge them together. In terms of its lasting power, In the Heart of the Sea roars in like a great tide, but then just as quickly dissipates."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,42,"Unfortunately, the reverence Howard and screenwriter Charles Leavitt seem to feel for the material ultimately dooms it to—if you’ll pardon the seafaring reference—float along in the doldrums, doomed to a driftless existence enlivened only by the occasional giant whale."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,42,"The movie has all the propulsion of a trolling motor, traversing long-charted dramatic waters."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,40,"For all the special effects and half-starved A-listers, this is a sodden beast. Perhaps there’s a reason that Melville only told half the story."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,40,"Even when the film does try to rouse emotion, it feels like a last minute attempt to make up for lack of character development."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,40,"In the Heart of the Sea isn’t a bad film, necessarily. It has some genuinely effective passages in its first half, and Howard is nothing if not a dutiful, check-the-boxes kind of director. But a story like this – one of horror and madness, which helped give birth to an ornate masterpiece of obsession – needs to go a little crazy. And this director doesn’t do crazy."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,40,"Howard shows his viewers what happened to these sailors, but he rarely offers any sense of who they were, or what it felt like to face their situation."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,40,"This movie has Chris Hemsworth, in between ""Avengers"" movies, and a lot of computer-generated sea life. It uses a lot of fancy lures, but it never hooks you."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,40,"In the Heart of the Sea feels stiff and unconvincing, weirdly devoid of texture, and populated by ciphers who speak primarily in the leaden language of exposition."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,38,Presenting a “true” adventure about a giant whale that supposedly inspired “Moby-Dick” raises tsunami-high expectations about In the Heart of the Sea that are crushed as thoroughly as if star Chris Hemsworth had brought down his “Thor” hammer on the entire enterprise.
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,38,"In the Heart of the Sea plays as if the joke was real and everyone on the production had caved in. The result, as a movie, is a joke."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,25,"The narrative is helplessly adrift, a yarn that extols vague grit and determination with no discernible through line."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,0,"The script, by Charles Leavitt, is dead in the water, and the drama is too, despite billowing sails and pods of whales. Instead of “Jaws” it’s a turgid “Tails.”"
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,90,Logan's Run is a rewarding futuristic film that appeals both as spectacular-looking escapist adventure as well as intelligent drama.
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,75,"Logan's Run is a vast, silly extravaganza that delivers a certain amount of fun, once it stops taking itself seriously."
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,70,"Logan's Run is less interested in logic than in gadgets and spectacle, but these are sometimes jazzily effective and even poetic. Had more attention been paid to the screenplay, the movie might have been a stunner."
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,70,"Taken for what it is, Logan's Run delivers a fun ride and a glimpse at another era, even if it's probably not the time frame the producers had in mind."
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,60,A sci-fi which balances big themes and claustrophobic action with apparent ease.
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,50,Hit-and-miss.
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,50,"The lavish production has some good effects sequences, but its plot is as corny as the dreadful lurex drape costumes and Jerry Goldsmith's slushy score. Fundamentally, this is just further proof of Hollywood's untiring ability to reduce all science fiction to its most feeble stereotypes."
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,40,"A numbing combination of sloppy writing, vulgar art direction, high school acting, and bungled special effects—in short, par for the course for venerable hack Michael Anderson."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,100,"Enter the Dragon goes far beyond the philosophical, of course. Its best sequences, and the only real reason for seeing it again, involve Lee's phenomenal physical and emotional presence."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,100,"Bruce Lee was the Fred Astaire of chop-socky, and Enter the Dragon represents his finest work."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,91,"Even though the movie was, in a lot of ways, a glorious mess, it turned out to be a huge success on just about every level."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,91,"A sequestered island, a slinky score, a villain with a secret scheme and a deadly prosthesis — it’d be good, cheesy fun even without the centerpiece fight sequences."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,90,"Bruce Lee's last movie is the only one that gives him the star treatment he deserved. His charismatic presence is remarkable in Enter the Dragon, and it's a shame he didn't have the chance to become the great, unique star he seemed destined to be."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,90,"Action superstar Bruce Lee's consensus best movie and biggest international hit. Lee is a secret agent inflitrating a sinister island kung fu kingdom, battling John Saxton, Jim Kelly and the nefarious martial arts lord Shih Fien in famous set-pieces like the hall of mirror showdown."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,88,"It's not a great film, but Lee's superhuman skills make it an occasionally jaw-dropping experience."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,80,"The movie can be flat-out fun, a sort of carnival of combat that can turn even a sophisticated audience into a group of gawking kids at a Saturday matinee."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,80,Film carries all the explosive trappings that make for a hit in its intended market and is glossed with a melodramatic narrative to take full advantage of its theme.
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,80,"Ripping entertainment overall, with just enough meat for amateur sociologists."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,80,"The lack of sentimentality helps focus the viewer on what the film depicts exceptionally well, namely wanton bad behavior and enthralling, wall-to-wall ass-kicking."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,80,The picture is expertly made and well‐meshed; it moves like lightning and brims with color.
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,75,"Nobody shows much evidence of acting ability, and the script is full of holes. Nonstop action is what these films are about, and that's what you get here."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,70,"Worth seeing for Lee, but still unforgivably wasteful of his talents."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,55,"Season of the Witch is barely even a Nicolas Cage movie. He wanders through the picture, zombified."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,50,"You know I am a fan of Nic Cage and Ron Perlman. Here, like cows, they devour the scenery, regurgitate it to a second stomach found only in actors and chew it as cud. It is a noble effort, but I prefer them in their straight-through Human Centipede mode."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,50,"Though it slows down in the back half, the opening acts of Season are reasonably entertaining."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,50,"The pretty good stuff comes early, when Nic and Ron, weary of wasting women and children, suffer an attack of conscience and desert the Crusades."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,50,"A mishmash of horror and history genres that's not as bad as its trailers but ultimately is dragged down by, of all things, its star."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,50,"The best thing about it is Claire Foy's performance as the seething, caged is-she-a-witch?. Foy, like a Brit Kristen Stewart, has an entrancing sparkle of disdain."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,42,It would take a lot more than holy water to rescue Season of the Witch from mediocrity.
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,40,"It's ""Centurion Deux"" without the second-coming-of-Carpenter pretense, though you still wish the trashiness were more distinctive."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,40,"The makeup department's glommed-on plague pustules are fantastic, but the concession to modern technology in a badly rendered last-act CGI demon, cut and pasted from a Diablo II screen-grab, is so eminently lame as to cure all fear of hellfire."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,40,"Cage supplies energy but no depth in his portrayal of a disillusioned knight. Ditto that for Perlman, who never feels comfortable in the sidekick role so he pretty much goes through the (exaggerated) motions."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,40,Does to the medieval era what Cage's Wicker Man did to Anthony Shaffer. Hokum and not in a good way.
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,38,"Cage appears as a knight of the Crusades, slogging across the continents, slaying infidels and unbelievers and anyone else who gets in his way. There isn't a minute when it looks like he's having fun."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,38,"Season of the Witch teeters on the edge of slipping into the ""so bad it's good"" camp, but ultimately ends up being merely bad."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,38,"A movie that appears to have been shot entirely on leftover sets from ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."""
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,30,"As usual, Cage alternates between leaden line readings and thunderous outbursts, making his accomplished costars Ulrich Thomsen and Stephen Campbell Moore look even better."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,30,"The entire film seems to be happening on the other side of a dirty window - good news for the dreadful computer-generated effects, if not for our eyes."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,30,"Season of the Witch is at its worst when it tries to be a straight-ahead action-adventure film. The early sequence set against the epic battles of the Crusades is almost brazenly bad with its unconvincing ""300""-style special effects."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,30,"Off the top of my head, I'm guessing that Season of the Witch claims a place in the top five all-time bizarre and pointless homages to art cinema."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,30,"Both overblown and undercooked, Season of the Witch is a fine example of a film that would've been great fun if only its creators had a sense of humor about the wild brew of absurdity they had percolating."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,25,"The movie proceeds in near darkness, perhaps to obscure its shoddy special effects, but the pervasive gloom is less discouraging than star Nicolas Cage's indifferent performance."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,25,"The best you can say about this hooey is that at least he had the King of the Bs, Ron Perlman, along for a few sidekick laughs."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,25,"After a while, the movie tires of the witch business and trots out a plot twist that permits the effects department to spend money. Some moviegoers might find the bait-and-switch funny."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,25,"The real plague is the movie, a sci-fi hodgepodge of bad history and worse special effects."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,25,"The film looks dispiritingly cheap and, as if in response, most of his cast seems half-committed at best, as if they're counting the moments until they can move on to a bigger picture."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,20,"At least ""Witch"" offers Perlman's easy, early-hominid charm, and a semi-suspenseful rickety-bridge scene."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,11,"Things do not end well, least of all for the audience."
Season of the Witch,5.4,24827228,10,Mr. Cage's knight ends up playing second banana to a digital devil. Welcome to the January dead zone.
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,100,"Despite its occasional shortcomings, From Russia with Love is still a terrific Bond entry. There's true chemistry between Connery's 007 and Armendariz's Kerim Bey, and it is all the more remarkable when considering that the Mexican actor was in great pain and living his final days while the shooting took place. His character's eventual fate is among the few in the Bonds to have a real emotional impact."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,91,"From Russia With Love has two of the sexiest images I’ve ever seen: the opening credits with the names projected on belly dancers’ writhing, whirling bodies, and the scene where a bare-chested, towel-clad Bond enters his bedroom and finds Tatiana Romanova in his bed. Images like that aren’t cute. They’re primordial."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,90,"For my money, still the best Bond, with a screwball plotline that keeps the locales changing and the surprises coming—even when reason dictates that the picture should be over. Lotte Lenya and Robert Shaw make a creepy pair, and Daniela Bianchi embodies the essence of centerfold sex, circa 1964."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,90,"It may seem grainy and fusty compared to the all-action tongue-in-cheek spectaculars that came later, but it's the Bond closest to my heart."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,90,"There's no point in trying to tell you all the mad, naughty things that take place — the meetings with mysterious people, the encounters with beautiful girls, the bomb explosions, the chases, the violent encounter of Bond with a helicopter, a motor boat race. Nor is there any point in trying to locate the various characters in the plot, all of whom are deliciously fantastic and delightfully well played."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,90,"An intentional heehaw at whodunits, an uproarious parody that may become a classic of caricature...Sophisticated? Well, not really. But fast, smart, shrewdly directed and capably performed. And though the film will scarcely eradicate the sex and violence that encumber contemporary movies, it may at least persuade producers that sick subjects may be profitably proffered with a healthy laugh."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,89,"This film began the fine tradition of deviating from Ian Fleming's novels, which gave us the suave, sophisticated Bond over Fleming's monosyllabic misogynist."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,88,"From Russia with Love is among the most tightly-plotted of all the Bond films, and, as a result, is one of the shortest. It moves briskly, blending intrigue, romance, and action into an immensely satisfying whole."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,80,A cracking cold war story.
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,80,"Written with enough self-consciously campy humor to defuse the paranoid ideologies running rampant here, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is also acted with tongues held firmly in cheek."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,80,"From Russia with Love is a preposterous, skillful slab of hardhitting, sexy hokum. After a slowish start, it is directed by Terence Young at zingy pace."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,80,"Despite being recognised as one of the better 007 films (and one laudably devoid of what would later become the formulaic Bond ending), number two in the series actually proves marginally less memorable than many of the others."
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,91,Much of the film's virtue lies in its straight-ahead narrative and uncomplicated morality. That and the undeniable charisma and virtuosity of its star.
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,90,There's something grand and enveloping about Fearless.
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,88,"Li plays haughty, brilliant wushu master Huo Yuanjia, whose recklessness leads to tragedy after he becomes a champion at the end of the 19th century."
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,83,"Though it somehow manages to be a movie about inner peace with crazy, incredibly staged fight scenes every 10 minutes, it is, first and foremost, a movie about inner peace."
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,78,"Billed as Li's final martial arts epic (would that Jackie Chan be so thoughtful), Fearless is fittingly peripatetic, finding the Hong Kong superstar ricocheting across the screen."
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,75,"One of those corny, lusciously mounted, almost predictably thrill-packed action movies you can't help but like."
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,75,"Despite some amusing jabs at America's influence on traditional China, this film leaves even this American viewer feeling oddly patriotic (or maybe just wishing she lived in China.)"
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,75,Li's performance is stronger here than it has been in previous films.
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,75,The final scenes pack a surprising melodramatic punch.
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,75,"Call it ""Jet Li's Wushu Retirement Party."""
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,75,"With the exception of one sequence, this PG-13 movie is so youth-friendly that I thought I might take my 10-year-old. But that sequence, upsetting for those of any age, makes the movie better suited for mature 12-year-olds and older."
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,70,"Witty choreography juices the pedestrian plot of Fearless, an earnest and technically accomplished biopic in which action star Jet Li flexes his limited dramatic muscles to portray kung fu master Huo Yuanjia."
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,70,Manages to pack a satisfying emotional punch.
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,70,Fearless sustains the tradition of ethically inflected Chinese action movies.
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,70,"Contrary to some reports, this is not Jet Li's last action movie--he already has another in postproduction--but it represents his farewell to wushu, the martial-arts tradition that made him an international star."
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,70,"The theme behind Fearless is utterly simplistic, but universal: violence begets violence. It's a never ending cycle that becomes more and more vicious, until someone decides to stop it. It's a worthy final installment."
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,67,"As the very traditional hero, Li keeps us riveted through the fisticuffs, and he also carries off the film's heavier dramatic moments well enough -- though, as always, his lack of a strong personality prevents the movie from ever genuinely catching fire."
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,67,"It's as subtle as a spinning kick, but some films aren't built for subtlety."
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,63,A lavish biopic that gives Li one of his juiciest roles but is relatively light on the action his fans have come to expect.
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,63,Rallies in the last reel.
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,60,"It's handsome, well-populated and offers beautiful scenery and settings. But ""House of Flying Daggers"" it ain't; maybe ""House of Fallen Arches""?"
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,50,"This is an action movie, and people don't come to be preached to; the ""Terminator"" flicks also favored world peace but didn't pause the action for nearly an hour to rub it in."
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,50,"The movie is an enjoyable but flawed attempt at an epic story, with too much of the best action concentrated in the beginning."
Huo yuanjia,7.7,24633730,50,"The truth is, Jet Li has gotten soft in his old age. While fans of the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" star will be pleased to learn that at least half of Fearless is action, what they may not realize is just how mushy everything else is."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,75,"Electric as Elektra, Jennifer Garner does a high-powered, blade-thrusting star turn as Marvel Comics' ninja-inspired superheroine, bringing such unbridled energy and sexuality to her performance, one barely notices the movie itself."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,60,Elektra isn't half-bad--only maybe two-fifths.
Elektra,4.7,24409722,50,"One of the least effective comic book-to-movie stories to have come along in the past few years. Without a viable screenplay, there's nowhere for the character to go, and no way to avoid making her look silly."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,50,"Elektra proves no more than fitfully satisfying, a character-driven superhero yarn whose flurry of last-minute rewriting shows in a disjointed plot."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,50,"Watching this is like sitting by a pinsetter at a bowling alley. That's too bad, because the picture had potential."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,50,"""Kill Bill"" without irony, and without Quentin Tarantino's flair for cool dialogue and chop-socky action (and without Uma Thurman, for that matter), Elektra is a pretty-looking, pretty dull adaptation of the Marvel Comic about a dishy, deadly assassin."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,50,"Her (Garner) grace and mystical abilities make for a lonely burden, and we are supposed to feel her pain. Instead, we feel our own for having to sit through this silly movie."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,50,"This doesn't exactly set the world on fire, but I was charmed by its old-fashioned storytelling, which is refreshingly free of archness, self-consciousness, or ""Kill Bill""-style wisecracks."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,50,An adequate but none-too-thrilling star vehicle for Jennifer Garner in flame-colored bustier and low-riding pants.
Elektra,4.7,24409722,50,"For the better part of this movie, Elektra  appears to be a sensible, stylish young superhero."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,50,"The role needs a steely, inhuman reserve, and Garner's innate likeability works against her."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,50,"The pedestrian Elektra offers no surprises, and whether or not you'll appreciate its modest charms depends entirely on whether you too have been anticipating Garner's new outfit."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,50,"The fights are mostly cool, save the final one with too many quick cuts, and the morphing graffiti and tattoos are nifty. If only the rest of it weren't so stupid."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,42,"A poorly written collection of comic-book movie cliches that offers nothing new to the genre, generates very little in the way of action thrills and plays like a self-important, humorless rip-off of ""Kill Bill."""
Elektra,4.7,24409722,40,"No question, the film's best special effect is Ms. Garner, especially when she's in costume."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,40,No fun at all.
Elektra,4.7,24409722,40,"What's missing -- apart, of course, from a plot -- is any character development."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,40,Pinup appeal alone does not a compelling movie make.
Elektra,4.7,24409722,40,Enormous plot holes and a script that’s fatally light on character mean there’s few selling points beyond Jennifer Garner's corset...
Elektra,4.7,24409722,38,Plays like a collision between leftover bits and pieces of Marvel superhero stories. It can't decide what tone to strike.
Elektra,4.7,24409722,33,"Just as all regular models can't be supermodels, so all action chicks can't be superheroines. Elektra Natchios turns out to be walled off rather than mysteriously alluring; blank rather than deep."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,33,"We end up with a piece of B-grade junk in which Elektra exchanges ""banter"" with the unexceptional Prout between fight scenes so badly shot that even Garner looks like a stunt double."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,30,"When a movie makes you wish you were watching Halle Berry in ""Catwoman,"" something is most definitely wrong."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,30,What it suffers from most is the sense of offhand storytelling that lies halfway between creative laziness and cost-cutting sloppiness.
Elektra,4.7,24409722,30,Along comes Elektra to effectively lower the bar for Marvel Comics page-to-screen transitions.
Elektra,4.7,24409722,30,Devotees of awful filmmaking can't go wrong with this one.
Elektra,4.7,24409722,25,Deadly dull.
Elektra,4.7,24409722,25,"As she sashays, mirthlessly, from one thankless confrontation to the next, it's unclear why anyone would find Garner any more deserving of stardom than certain mannequins."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,25,"Another inert, soul-dead action drama that turns actors into zombies...It's garbage."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,25,"Part of the problem is that Garner, so irresistible on television and in last year's ""13 Going on 30,"" just can't pull off the cold-hearted killer routine."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,25,"Lacks thrills, narrative, emotion, believability, character development--and frankly--watchability."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,25,Breathlessly boring.
Elektra,4.7,24409722,25,"Elektra isn't just poorly executed, it's emotionally false and makes absolutely no narrative sense."
Elektra,4.7,24409722,20,"Not stupid enough to qualify as good, dumb fun."
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,75,"A cynical, savage satire about violence, the media and depravity. It doesn't have the polish of ""Natural Born Killers"" or the wit of ""Wag the Dog,"" but it's a real movie, rough edges and all, and not another link from the sausage factory."
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,75,"The picture is more impressive as it goes along, revealing a symmetry of construction underneath the rudiments of a thriller."
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,75,Boasts a fine cast and makes enough cogent points that it rises above standard cop fare.
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,70,A first-rate Hollywood entertainment--at least if one can accept the schizophrenia of combining a cop/buddy action thriller with an angry satire about the shamelessness of the media.
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,70,"It's a fast, entertaining ride."
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,70,"Both audacious and unwieldy, exciting and excessive, this dark thriller is too long, too violent and not always convincing. But at the same time, there's no denying that it's onto something, that its savage indictment of the nexus involving media, crime and a voracious public is a cinematic statement difficult to ignore."
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,70,"Big, loud and lurid, but no less entertaining for that."
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,63,A fairly hypocritical exercise -- and one that's so flamboyant and overbearing that it comes perilously close to being a classic awful.
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,60,"The Czech Republic and Russia, the respective homes of Emil and Oleg, should sue."
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,58,Less a movie for intelligent moviegoers than a suggestion that we're all brainless chickens.
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,50,"The premise is promising, but Herzfeld cares more about sensationalism than substance, and portions of the picture are far nastier than they had to be."
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,50,"Too busy trying to make remarks to be much fun in the end. But it really only has one remark, which it reiterates about a thousand times, and it's not all that remarkable: Fame is overrated."
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,50,A thriller more contrived than it is exciting.
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,50,"Herzfeld's sophomore movie is one long howl of rage over the relationship between criminals, journalists and thrill-hungry audiences."
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,40,The unearned air of moralism that wafts through 15 Minutes pollutes its entertainment value.
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,40,Clumsy urban thriller.
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,40,15 Minutes settles into Richard Donner-style goulash.
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,38,"Herzfeld also wrote the screenplay, and so its leaden and obvious tone and the resulting dearth of delicacy rests squarely on him."
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,38,"Is less an end in itself than an excuse, a jumping off point for showy, contrived, borderline exploitation sequences that fail to tie together because they're not really there to do anything but sell themselves as money shot thrills."
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,38,"It's the poster child for bad taste, not to mention bad construction."
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,30,15 Minutes is simply a bad movie.
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,30,"It's fleet- footed, merciless entertainment. But the mixture of laughs, bathos and brutality is a big turnoff."
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,25,"John Herzfeld, the writer-director, attacks America's lust for voyeuristic sensationalism by aping the very tactics he decries."
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,25,"They (De Niro, Burns) look good together. But what a staggering pity they chose such a nasty, hackneyed movie to demonstrate their chemistry."
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,25,It all adds up to one of the most brazen pieces of blame-shifting in exploitation-picture history.
15 Minutes,6.1,24403552,20,"Isn't just rotten -- badly acted, badly written, badly conceived -- it's dead inside."
Bronco Billy,6.1,24265659,88,"Bronco Billy is an odd salute to those clean hearted good guy cowboys like Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, and Clint manages to revel in the glory of that myth despite the fact that he is probably more responsible for making that kind of Western unworkable in modern cinema than anyone else I can think of."
Bronco Billy,6.1,24265659,80,"Basically, it's the charming tale of a New Jersey shoe-salesman who fantasises about being a cowboy, and takes a group of assorted weirdos on the road with a travelling show. Not a lot to it in terms of plot, but Eastwood manages to both undermine and celebrate his character's fantasy life, while offering a few gentle swipes at contemporary America (the Stars and Stripes tent sewn together by mental hospital inmates). Fragile, fresh, and miles away from his hard-nosed cop thrillers, it's the sort of film only he would, and could, make."
Bronco Billy,6.1,24265659,80,"Low-key sentiment sets the stage for the new, improved Clint Eastwood -- relaxed, funny and refreshingly human. Bronco Billy is Dirty Harry with a sense of humor. More fun than a saloon full of six-shooters."
Bronco Billy,6.1,24265659,80,"Eastwood is perfection as the New Jersey shoe clerk who, like Miniver Cheevey, dreamed a nostalgic dream and took action to realize it. The actor-director could have gone over the top by satirizing the very character he played so well in spaghetti westerns; instead he gives a sincere, realistic performance that silenced detractors who thought he could only play violent loners."
Bronco Billy,6.1,24265659,75,The best and funniest Clint Eastwood movie in quite a while.
Bronco Billy,6.1,24265659,70,The movie is so shabbily written (by Dennis Hackin) and unevenly directed (by Eastwood himself) that the traditional obstacles to romantic comedy consummation are overwhelmed by superfluous complications and imprecise calculations.
Iron Eagle,5.4,24159872,70,"Iron Eagle is a very shrewd teen-age variation on the Rambo/Missing in Action formula, a military rescue movie with a nice young hero and a fun-loving feeling."
Iron Eagle,5.4,24159872,50,Director Sidney J. Furie fills in the rest with breakneck action and some dandy dogfights. Much of the dialog is simply laughable.
Iron Eagle,5.4,24159872,50,Iron Eagle has an unintended hilarity that builds and builds. But don't take this as one of those so-bad-it's-good endorsements: The film is a total waste of time.
Iron Eagle,5.4,24159872,40,A ridiculous rabble-drowser with the heart of a bully and the soul of a thief.
Iron Eagle,5.4,24159872,38,"It is regrettable that the highest of production values have been invested in this, the cheapest of stories."
Iron Eagle,5.4,24159872,38,"Yet another totally absurd bout of macho wish fulfillment for those frustrated by the American government and military's inability to deal effectively with terrorism, Iron Eagle is actually more outlandish than most."
Virtuosity,5.6,24048000,80,"Virtuosity is a sleek, brutal techno-thriller that generates nonstop action, but for at least some of us the fun is spoiled by its numbing body count and murky story line."
Virtuosity,5.6,24048000,75,"What redeems Virtuosity a little is that even at the end, even in the midst of the action cliches, it still finds surprises in the paradox of a villain that is also a program."
Virtuosity,5.6,24048000,63,"Unfortunately, Virtuosity ignores character development in favor of slick set design and mindless action sequences. Consequently, it plays like an outdated video game."
Virtuosity,5.6,24048000,63,"If all of Virtuosity were as tightly controlled as that, it would exert a greater fascination than it finally does."
Virtuosity,5.6,24048000,60,"Nevertheless, given Washington's presence and the promise of a virtual reality action story, Virtuosity has some appeal -- provided, of course, the viewers aren't selective."
Virtuosity,5.6,24048000,50,"Watching movies like this strain to fit new technologies like VR into old genres and plot conventions, you can't help wondering whether the real artificial intelligence experiment these days isn't Hollywood itself. Plug the psychological profiles of 200 hit movies into its hive-mind, and out comes one plastic-bodied, loop-brained clone after another."
Virtuosity,5.6,24048000,50,"Quality premise, poor execution."
Virtuosity,5.6,24048000,42,"Even with its cyberspace connection, the story comes across as flat and tired, merely a pretext for the filmmakers' occasionally dazzling but ultimately numbing special effects. The world of Virtuosity may be spanking new, but the ideas are yesterday's news."
Virtuosity,5.6,24048000,40,"Though Virtuosity connects all the dots to give audiences a roller-coaster ride, the movie begets nothing new: It's stillborn."
Virtuosity,5.6,24048000,40,"Washington is wasted here. Kelly Lynch is wooden.  Crowe has a ball going over the top, but how much taunting and eyeball popping can a performer do?"
Virtuosity,5.6,24048000,38,"Despite some briefly breathtaking, computer-generated special effects, Virtuosity is 95 minutes of unsubstantial firefights and meandering plot twists."
Virtuosity,5.6,24048000,38,"The presence of Washington lends the picture a much-needed dose of authenticity. But in the end Virtuosity is disconnected and uninvolving, despite -- or maybe because of -- a climax that comes in three distinct waves. One section seems to be a half-hour sound-and-light show."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,100,"Coraci has given us a film that is not only amusing, but well-acted, and not only well-acted, but gorgeous. Micha Klein's animated transitions alone, which are used to signal each change in location, are wondrous and lovely to behold."

Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,70,"Finds a winning formula: Chan provides the action, various exotic lands serve up props begging to be employed in Chan-style combat, Coogan brings the dry wit, a minor constellation of surprise guest stars provides razzle-dazzle, and a steady stream of mild chuckles helps the whole fandango fly by painlessly."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,70,"Sails along on a slipstream of pleasant scenery, amusing incident and the boundless charms of its appealing leading men, Jackie Chan and Steve Coogan: It's an unexpectedly buoyant spectacular."

Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,67,"What's new and nutty, though, is the physical comedy of Jackie Chan as Fogg's manservant."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,60,"As the tourist on a time budget, the usually brilliant Coogan merely mugs and flails (we can only imagine what Johnny Depp would have done with Fogg), while he and able straight man Chan enjoy scant opportunity to develop any comic rapport."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,60,"Takes plenty of liberties with the material and never generates much genuine excitement, but provides an agreeable ride without overloading it with contemporary filmmaking mannerisms."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,60,"Just going through the motions here (and mild ones at that), both Chan and the movie should have stayed at home."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,50,"Although each episode might be marginally entertaining in its own right, the overall effect is that the movie isn't funny enough, exciting enough, or dramatic enough to warrant two hours of an audience member's time."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,50,"The major problem with Around the World is that there's just not quite enough Chan, or at least the Chan we want to see, which is the acrobatic clown."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,50,"A leaden excuse for family entertainment, loosely inspired by Jules Verne's 1873 novel, coarsened almost beyond recognition and dominated by Jackie Chan's comic martial-arts schtick."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,50,Not even Chan's imaginative fight choreography redeems this folly.
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,50,"Brightly colored, spiffily designed and easy to sit through in a harmless Disney sort of way, but the comedy never accumulates any momentum."

Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,50,"Coogan and Broadbent are agile and expressive, but too much time goes to Chan's silly stunts. A colorful disappointment."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,50,Any resemblance between Jules Verne's marvelous science fiction novel or Mike Todd's enjoyable 1956 movie is pure happenstance. This is simply a Jackie Chan movie pitched to youngsters who enjoy slapstick fights and goofy caricatures.
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,40,"It livens up a bit in the last reel when Foggs inventive brain pulls out all the stops to try to win the bet, but by that point you'll be too jaded to care."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,40,"With the exception of one masterfully choreographed - and improbably bloodless - martial-arts gang fight, the new version of Jules Verne's Around the World in 80 Days is one of the lamest remakes of a classic film I've ever seen."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,38,"A peppy, fast-moving, wafer-thin amusement that's fine for kids if you don't mind a lot of Three Stooges-style martial arts. For grown-ups, it's the equivalent of a 59-cent tin globe."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,38,"Heaven knows what the suits at Disney were thinking, for what they ended up with was a bland Jackie Chan movie and a lifeless travelogue."

Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,30,"Among the several iterations of Jules Verne's novel about the inventor's adventures whilst traipsing through England, Asia and the Wild West, this new one is the least impressive and most depressive. Even the 1989 made-for-TV version starring Pierce Brosnan possessed more spark and steam than this lazy, lackluster take."

Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,91,"It's not hard to imagine these characters in a straight-faced Hollywood blockbuster. And that's the source of Hot Fuzz's genius, pointing out the thin line that separates convention from farce when Hollywood starts throwing its special effects around."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,90,"For most of its running time, it's an enjoyably unpretentious celebration of the guilty pleasure we can take from a stupid-as-all-get-out car chase or from watching things blow up real good. Then, in its final half hour, Wright and Pegg ratchet up the absurdity tenfold and enter the realm of the sublime."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,90,"Wright and Pegg are storytellers who weave their naughty bits into genuine characters and a plot. It's a ridiculous plot, but one that's absolutely in the spirit of the films they're satirizing."

Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,83,"Hot Fuzz is something all too rare in movie comedies: a story rather than a string of disjointed skits, with hearty characters behind its caricatures."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,83,"It's smashing fun, nonetheless, made with razor wit and continual invention and far, far fresher than not only Hollywood buddy-cop movies but also Hollywood's own spoofs of them."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,A sustained genre parody that's equally funny but (maybe in deference to the genre) much more pumped up.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,"A British variation on Hollywood nonsense, and as such it's a little gloomier, a little coarser, and a lot more cerebral--oh, and funnier than all the ""Reno 911!"" boxed sets combined."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,"Since Mr. Wright and Mr. Pegg are essentially parodying self-parodies, they have also smartly kinked up their conceit by setting most of the film in a sleepy village that might as well be called Ye Old English Towne, thereby wedding one of the most irritating British exports to one of the most absurd American ones. Think of it as ""The Full Monty"" blown to smithereens."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,The boys (now in blue) have done it again.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,At once deeply affectionate and sharply observed: There's never anything smart-alecky about Wright's approach as a director.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,"The whole enterprise goes far beyond pastiche, wreathing its characters in a film-intoxicated world."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,"Really, do we need another dumb action movie to remind us how dumb action movies are?...Yes. We absolutely do."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,"The thrill of Hot Fuzz is the chemistry between Nicholas and local oaf Danny Butterman, who is an action film aficionado and finds Nicholas' stories utterly engrossing."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,78,The most originally funny movie to hit U.S. screens in a while.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"A little too long and suffers from a sagging midsection when the level of exposition becomes laborious, but the spectacularly entertaining final 30 minutes compensates for a lot of flaws."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,It's a blast.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"The best of it is a riot--a ""Bad Boys II"" fireball hurled with exquisite accuracy at a quaint English town peopled by Agatha Christie archetypes."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"With Hot Fuzz, you'll just have to settle for semi-hilarity."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"A real actioner, generous with the bullets and blood and chase scenes, that simultaneously mocks shoot-'em-ups."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"Plays like two films in one, and succeeds on both levels."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"It's to the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies what left-hand driving on a country lane is to a freeway chase: pokey, more than a little daft, but with a bloody surprise around every hedge."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"It's bloody carnage - or it's ketchup, or bolognese sauce, at the very least."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,Deeply nuts and exhaustingly hilarious.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,70,"Hot Fuzz deploys the same mix of genre conventions, slapstick and old-school British humor that made ""Shaun of the Dead"" such a dumb-but-good romp."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,70,"Hot Fuzz is fun, and it's nice to see all the English character actors who aren't busy in Harry Potter films, but it lacks its predecessor's freshness."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,63,"Basically a one-joke movie, and they take their sweet time -- too much of it, actually -- getting to the good stuff. But what excellent laughs they provide in the end."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,63,"Though it's no ""Monty Python,"" Hot Fuzz is a clever, over-the-top marriage of mayhem and merriment."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,60,"All the action is staged with energy, but it gets relentless without anything really funny going on."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,70,"More fun than any civilization’s fiery extinction should ever be, Paul W.S. Anderson’s Pompeii 3-D is gloriously exciting kitsch – a poor man’s ""Titanic"" crossed with an even poorer man’s ""Gladiator."""
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,70,"Part sword-and-sandal spectacle, part disaster epic, Pompeii accomplishes its ambitious agenda to largely engrossing effect."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,67,"Fortunately, Pompeii’s second half is tailor-made for Anderson’s established skill set, unfolding over a matter of hours, with many scenes set in and under a gladiatorial amphitheatre that recalls the arenas, subterranean tunnels, and cavernous vessels of Anderson’s best movies."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,63,This is a surprisingly old-fashioned disaster movie. In point of fact its old-fashioned-ness is really the only surprising thing about this eye-popping 3D spectacle.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,63,Anderson’s stab at rendering the Mount Vesuvius catastrophe with a 3-D “Titanic” gloss.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,63,"What Anderson delivers this one time is a genuine spectacle, a gladiator movie with a volcano in the middle of it."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,60,Mr. Anderson displays his mastery as a director in the sword-fighting scenes... But the glares and eye rolls that bookend these scenes are what make this film both GIF-ready and campy fun.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,60,"Anderson distinguishes himself as the rare action director who shows us real bodies in real space in real reaction to each other, who prizes legibility over quick-cut dazzlement, who stages his fights with comic-book zeal rather than puffed-up graphic-novel miserableness."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,60,"While more coherent than much of Anderson’s recent work, the film proves less successful at combining destruction and damsel-in-distress storytelling within the same frame, serving up blurry images of Milo trying to rescue Cassia while the city crumbles around them."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,58,"Most of the film is a chintzy but watchable B-movie knockoff of ""Gladiator,"" with Kit Harington, the English actor from ""Game of Thrones,"" mustering very little in the way of facial expressivity in the role of Milo."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,50,A wildly flawed but fitfully diverting picture.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,50,"No doubt the audiences in the Coliseum would offer a thumbs-up to the scale of the destruction, though even they might have had some quibbles about the special effects, which, too often, resemble a very large pile of melting crayons."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,50,"Pompeii is a big, glorious, cheesy mess."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,50,The result is a generic saga with a cast of forgettable one-dimensional characters
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,50,A campy guilty pleasure that serves up a “Gladiator’’ knockoff as an appetizer to the impressively flame-filled main course.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,50,"The movie is so grand in scale that you can’t help surrender to the spectacle, even if the stuff that’s going on with the people in the film is often close to risible."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,40,"Pompeii make tick all the necessary movie checkboxes, but its execution is unoriginal and uninspired."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,40,"Anderson’s Pompeii doesn’t sweat the human stuff. His camera is mostly trained on the big picture: billowing smoke, tidal-waves, fireballs streaking through the sky. What’s happening to the people on the ground doesn’t matter, so long as we’re aware that 95 percent of them are being squashed or torched."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,40,"While it offers spectacular CGI devastation and a chiselled hero, Pompeii is so soulless and empty that you won’t shed any tears when the ‘cano blows its top."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,40,"Over-reaching and unintentionally amusing, this is straight-to-video quality inexplicably delivered at blockbuster scale. A thunderous volca-NO."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,40,"Pompeii delivers the goods – well, at least during its final 20 minutes."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,40,"Pompeii just feels like an excuse to rain digital terror on screaming extras. There’s much to see here, but little to feel, and even less to remember."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,37,"Paul W.S. Anderson, best known for the “Resident Evil” franchise and 2011’s “The Three Musketeers,” creates harrowing simulations of the disaster. It’s enough to make you want him to ditch the story altogether."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,35,"The first sixty minutes of Pompeii are awful, bordering on unwatchable... The final forty-five minutes of the movie however are, by sheer force of will, irrefutably entertaining. At least there’s raining death in the form of fireballs smashing up the place."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,30,Anderson's repeated hurling of flaming volcanic projectiles directly at the screen — the dominant feature of the latter third of Pompeii — is firmly in the lovably trashy spirit of the '50s drive-in.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,30,It fails to offer as single compelling character as a sacrifice to the angry volcano.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,30,"While Anderson excels in the film’s many moments of digital doom-and-gloom, he can’t deliver a single authentic emotion between the two star-crossed leads, leaving us with a sooty aftertaste of having sat through one very loud rendition of Titanic in togas."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,25,"It's a spectacle, all right -- but mostly just of a lot of people, some of whom should know better, making an utter ash of themselves."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,25,"If you think of Pompeii as a ride, a conveyance for special effects, and not anything resembling an emotional experience, indifference can almost be a good thing."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,25,"Shockingly, the violent release of smoke, fire, and meteoric debris is positioned more as a climactic afterthought than as the main attraction."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,20,There’s not enough villainy—nor lip-smacking comeuppance—to justify a smiting by ash or falling column. The movie in your head melts ten times better.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,8,"When you plunk down your $12, you will get the destruction you were promised. But it's too bad it's such a repetitive, unengaging, glaringly digital experience and worse than that, you'll have to sit through the disaster that is the rest of movie."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,0,It’s impossible to find anything that grabs you in Pompeii. This lumpen adventure with a misguided romance buries anything in the disaster-flick genre that might have been a blast.
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,100,"Transcendence is a bold, beautiful, sometimes confounding flight of futuristic speculation firmly rooted in the potential of today’s technology."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,70,An ambitious and provocative piece of work that is intriguingly balanced between being a warning and a celebration.
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,70,"Transcendence is a dark, lurchingly entertaining pastiche of age-old worries, future-shock jolts, hot-button topics and old-fashioned genre thrills."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,67,"Moderately entertaining, periodically draggy, Transcendence is not as wacky-visionary as “The Matrix,” or nearly as lyrical as “Her.”"
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,67,"While never as dynamically involving as Christopher Nolan's ""Inception,"" for which longtime Nolan director of photography Pfister justifiably won an Oscar,  Transcendence still grapples with provocative existential concepts in similarly thoughtful terms."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,63,"Echoing the lessons learned from ""HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey,"" the message of Transcendence is that computers should not be allowed to become sentient."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,63,"Apart from Mychael Danna’s portentous orchestral and electronic score, Transcendence simply lacks oomph: Shots don’t overwhelm, scenes don’t pop and nothing on the screen gets under your skin."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,63,"The most galling thing about Transcendence, though, isn't its inability to get a handle on what, if anything, it wants to say about the enormous changes happening to the human race, it's the movie's ending, which seems calculated to reassure us that everything's going to be fine as long as the right people are in charge, especially if they're good looking."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,60,"A movie that’s of two minds. It’s well-grounded, but also over the top. It’s a man-vs.-machine epic and also an intimate drama. It’s quirky-smart yet sci-fi silly. And it winds up being half as good as it could be."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,58,A thoroughly mundane experience.
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,Transcendence looks and sounds like a Christopher Nolan film that got attacked by malware.
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"Transcendence never quite succeeds at telling a story of scientific overreach. And it doesn’t really click as an action movie either. But as a human tragedy of man and monster, of beauty and beast, it has just enough genuine pathos that you wish it were better."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"Watching it all unfold and slowly go off the rails, you can't help but wonder what Pfister's mentor, Nolan, might have done with the same material. My guess is he would have sent the script back for a Page One rewrite for starters."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"Science fiction has an obligation to seduce the viewer into applying the ""willing suspension of disbelief."" With its plot holes and head-scratching incongruities, Transcendence fails in this arena thereby making the production as a whole feel bloated and unsatisfying."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"The story soon devolves into a far-fetched, futuristic snooze-fest that often defies its own logic. Characters' motivations are rarely clear, and allegiances shift with no explanation."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"There’s a lot of intelligence in Transcendence. Ironically, almost all of it feels artificial."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"An ambitious movie, but ultimately there’s too much “artificial” and not enough “intelligence.”"
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"Transcendence is a movie without villains, thrills or, after Nolan fanboys show up, much of an audience."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"After an intriguing start, Transcendence — aka ""The Computer Wore Johnny Depp's Tennis Shoes"" — offers roughly the same level of excitement as listening to hold music during a call to tech support."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"Clever ideas early on go rogue, or go missing, in the gallop toward an action-film climax that then, perversely, doesn’t materialize. The movie’s intelligence is artificial, its affect solemn."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"Despite its looks, talent and pedigree, Transcendence never becomes the movie it could have been."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"Pfister, who, like his mentor Nolan, adamantly continues to shoot on film (not digital), shows a sure hand at staging scenes, creating visuals and setting a tone -- if only all the diverse elements here fit comfortably under the same tent."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,Unquestionably the work of both a newbie director and a green screenwriter.
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,42,"This humorless science-fiction cautionary tale feels like a relic from an earlier era, pulled out of a dusty old box of zip disks and 56k modems."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,42,"Wally Pfister, best known until now as the cinematographer on Christopher Nolan's big films, makes his directorial debut here, and as dumb as Paglen's script is, Pfister seems to have no feeling whatsoever for the staging of sequences or for any sort of dramatic narrative momentum."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,42,"While the core concepts of Transcendence and the questions they pose are inherently interesting, the manner in which the themes are explored feels extremely superficial."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"Transcendence is nowhere near as elegant, witty, or insightful as ""Her."" Pfister and the screenwriter, Jack Paglen, grapple ponderously, sometimes oafishly, with the ethical and philosophical issues at stake in the film’s premise."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"Transcendence, written by Jack Paglen, is just more business as usual, one of those ""control technology or it will control you"" sermons that nonetheless enlists the usual heap of technically advanced special effects."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"Transcendence wants to use this future panic to comment meaningfully on our current interconnectedness and inorganic lifestyle, but it’s screaming too much to have that conversation."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"Transcendence suffers from terrible timing, arriving a few months after Spike Jonze charmed audiences with his semi-futuristic love story ""Her,"" which flipped a century’s worth of technophobia on its back."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"A bright idea, disappointingly dulled in the execution."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"While Transcendence has tons of money to spend on unpersuasive digital effects and dronelike music, it shows little interest in exploring the potentially tricky benefits of a computer-enhanced intellect; it’s not even in the enjoyable realm of starkly ridiculous Cold War thrillers like ""Colossus: The Forbin"" Project."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"You can feel this movie's attempts at Big Ideas about technology get weighed down by a dopey, nonsensical plot."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"There are intriguing, half-formed ideas afoot in Transcendence, but the script and Pfister’s heavy, humorless direction tend to reduce everything to simplistic standoffs between good and evil."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"If you programmed an algorithm to figure out how The Lawnmower Man might be retold by Snake Plissken at the conclusion of Escape from L.A., you'd still wind up with a more recognizably human effort."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,38,"This thoughtful but windy and winded sci-fi thriller shortchanges the science – understandably - and the thrills. The directing debut of “Dark Knight” cinematographer Wally Pfister is a mopey affair with indifferent performances, heartless romance and dull action. It transcends nothing."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,38,The real trouble with Transcendence is that it just isn’t all that scary — at least not in the way that it wants to be.
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,37,"Jack Paglen’s script casts artificial intelligence and its dangers as the central trouble for its ensemble cast, but Pfister chooses to explore it in essentially a two-hour “getting ready” montage."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,33,All I can cull is: don't mess with Mother Nature and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Fortune-cookie stuff. Erase All.
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,25,"Transcendence is ""Her"" for dummies."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,25,"Lethargic direction, bland visuals, credulity-straining plotting and tin-eared dialogue turn even pros like Rebecca Hall, Paul Bettany and Morgan Freeman into sleepwalking bores."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,25,"A pointless nightmare of pretentious science fiction twaddle with no plot, no coherence and no heart."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,25,"Transcendence is the worst, most portentous, and certainly the silliest big-budget science fiction film since the 2008 Keanu Reeves remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,20,"Ambitious to a fault, this cautionary fantasy about artificial intelligence has so much on its muddled mind, and so little sense of dramatic grounding, that it grows ever more preposterous before lurching to a climax that's utterly unfathomable."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,100,"Anyone expecting gritty realism will be disappointed, because Hill is offering something better: shooting entirely on NY locations at night, he has transformed the city into a phantasmagoric labyrinth of weird tribes in fantastic dress and make-up who move over (and under) the streets as untouched as troglodytes by the civilisation sleeping around them. Mixing ironic humour, good music, and beautifully photographed suspense, it's one of the best of 1979."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,100,"For me personally, It’s one film that can’t be redone for the simple fact, there isn’t a living director that can capture what made this movie work! If you’ve never seen this film, I can’t recommend it highly enough. It’s definitely in my TOP 5 of “All time greatest movies.”"
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,90,"The Warriors is a deeply silly movie. Its gangs are ridiculous comic-book figures. Still, director Walter Hill treats its world with total seriousness. Bleak synthesizer drones thrum and throb. The streets glow with slickly inky-black greasiness. Nobody smiles. It’s so awesome."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,80,"The Warriors is a visual feast. Director Hill fills the frame with vibrant colors, bright lights, and nonstop motion. The uniforms of the various gangs are unique, funny, fearsome, and more than a bit theatrical. The exciting fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed, and instead of focusing on the violence, Hill concentrates on pure movement (most of the cast were actually dancers)."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,75,"The Warriors is a gangland fantasia, cut tighter than a snare drum, made for maximum impact."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,75,"Hill, shooting by night and on location together with his OOP Andrew Laszlo, gives the film dazzling style. New York's oil-slicked streets become a labyrinth lit by pools of reflecting light, both scary and strangely beautiful - grimy realism it isn't. It also manages to humanize the gang-bangers to a surprising extent, illustrating the material and emotional poverty that forces them onto the streets in the first place."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,75,"The Warriors is a comic book morality tale, Westside Story crossed with A Clockwork Orange. The movie is so perversely fascinating in a variety of ways that it’s too bad the imagination demonstrated wasn’t used for something better than what turns out to be one more exploitation film in which the audience is encouraged to cheer the sights and sounds of mayhem."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,60,"The film is as handsome to watch as it is preposterous to listen to, full of gorgeous nocturnal city images that splash blaring neon colors against filthy, rain-slicked gray. Mr. Hill uses subways, jukeboxes, spectacularly eerie costumes and deserted streets to create a stark yet extravagant visual style, and a grimy little world in which everything looks curiously brand-new. Thanks to a lot of wipes and slow-motion shots, you are never in danger of forgetting that somebody clever is at the helm."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,60,"Walter Hill's existential action piece, rendered in a complete stylistic abstraction that will mean tough going for literal-minded audiences. Not quite the clean, elegant creation that his earlier films were, The Warriors admits to failures of conception (occasional) and dialogue (frequent), but there is much of value in Hill's visual elaboration of the material."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,60,"Theme of the pic, based on Sol Yurick’s 1965 novel, is a variation on countless westerns and war films. Update the setting to modern-day New York, and the avenues of escape to graffiti-emblazoned subway cars, and that’s The Warriors."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,60,"The Warriors is a real peculiarity, a movie about street gang warfare, written and directed as an exercise in mannerism. There's hardly a moment when we believe that the movie's gangs are real or that their members are real people or that they inhabit a real city. That's where the peculiarity comes in: I don't think we're supposed to. No matter what impression the ads give, this isn't even remotely intended as an action film. It's a set piece. It's a ballet of stylized male violence."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,60,"If the movie is not as dangerous as its detractors claim, neither is it as glorious and memorable as some of its less discriminating admirers would have it. I find the spectacle fading from my memory in a jumble of dislocated colors and motions. In retrospect, it seems too studiously unreal."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,75,It’s tempting to think Hitman undermines any beauty it musters with its habit of ridiculousness.
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,63,"If you strip away all the gunplay, Hitman: Agent 47 would be about 10 minutes long."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,60,"Newbie director Aleksander Bach handles the project with a competent precision. The film doesn’t rise above the genre and the plot is muddled, but he pulls off the basic elements with a distinctly chilly European style."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,58,"In this post-""Mad Max: Fury Road"" action movie age, “occasionally bonkers” just doesn’t cut it anymore."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,50,"Hitman: Agent 47 might offer a passable diversion for action junkies but, for everyone else, it's best avoided."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,40,"Delve into the story at your own risk, but embrace the unrepentant stupidity of it all and there’s a zen-like joy to be found in this screenvomit of adolescent violence."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,40,"At the end, the door is left open for a sequel, but Agent 47 doesn’t feel like a character who’s got what it takes to be a franchise hero. He, and the film, are lacking in personality."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,40,"Consistently off by a beat, Hitman: Agent 47 fails to ever click into gear."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,40,"This vaguely science-fiction action picture based on a video game (and not a sequel to 2007’s Hitman) is an idiotic mess with a bafflingly dense prologue, an endless final battle, lifeless performances and anticlimactic twists, but it does have a degree of visual flair."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,40,"After a while, you give up trying to make sense of the plot and sit there gaping at the car crashes, fight scenes, and shootings. The problem is that even the mayhem quickly becomes repetitive."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,38,"The plot is just high-tech Swiss Cheese, filled with holes and smelling like last week’s refrigerator contents."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,33,"Agent 47 is just slightly less dull than its disavowed predecessor — or at least its dullness seems less active, because it doesn’t turn anyone as inherently interesting as Olyphant into a dour-faced killing machine."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,30,"Hitman: Agent 47, much like its anonymous title, is a film pretending to be an action movie instead of the real thing. It might as well be a commercial. Or, hell, a video game."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,30,Writers Skip Woods and Michael Finch have a few tricks up their sleeves as betrayals emerge and allegiances shift. But it's not enough to make us care or to keep the third act from being a head-scratching mess.
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,30,"For all its cheap talk about the importance of innovation, Agent 47 just feels like a copy of a copy of a copy."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,30,"Insofar as Hitman: Agent 47 is about anything, really, it’s about the pleasures of being on location — from the gratuitous image of Ware taking a dip in a five-star-hotel swimming pool to the sight of Singapore’s staggering Gardens by the Bay."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,25,"It often seems that “Agent 47” is more concerned with landscape, buildings, offices and subway stations than it is with characters. It’s a lost cause and we lose interest long before we’re shown the exotic architecture of Singapore."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,25,"The movie — which looks and sounds like a more brutal Bond knockoff — is at least consistently stylish, though its tone is less assured."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,25,"Hitman: Agent 47 takes an austere European aesthetic and combines it with Hollywood mindlessness, and the result is like a guilty pleasure, minus the pleasure."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,25,It’s all as pointless as the asthma inhaler with which one character treats his advanced lung cancer.
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,25,"Hitman: Agent 47 is aggressively awful, the kind of film that rubs its lackadaisical screenwriting, dull filmmaking and boring characters in your face, almost daring you to ask the theater operator for your money back."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,25,"It’s the first feature film for director Aleksander Bach, and he shares the blame with the pair of screenwriters. His creation is a muddled mess that is briefly lifted by some fun set pieces, but never is more impressive than a 108-minute Audi commercial."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,25,"If first-timer Aleksander Bach's choices as a director are any indication, he's a filmmaker who cares less about characters and actors than about dubious surface dazzle."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,20,"Hitman: Agent 47 is tedious, soulless and, for a film with a relatively trim runtime, seemingly never-ending."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,20,"Hitman: Agent 47 is a by-the-numbers schlock action sequel that writes its own epitaph when a character mutters the dusty insult, “You’re dead, too. You just don’t know it yet.”"
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,20,"Dumb as dirt and just as generic, Hitman: Agent 47 trades brains for bullets and characters for windup toys."
Hitman: Agent 47,5.7,22467450,20,"Hitman: Agent 47 is a film that bears nothing but a passing resemblance to the game that spawned it, but that shouldn’t surprise anyone, as it’s all just a cash grab, anyway. No choice but to wash, rinse, repeat: cha-ching."
Death Wish,7,22000000,75,In Death Wish we get just about the definitive Bronson; rarely has a leading role contained fewer words or more violence.
Death Wish,7,22000000,60,"The sense of location is strong, emphasising a hostile, nightmarish terrain; but Winner's recourse to caricature when dealing with police and thugs, and his virtually overt sympathies with the confused, violent Bronson, make for uncritical, simplistic viewing."
Death Wish,7,22000000,60,"Death Wish is so cannily fabricated that it sometimes succeeds in arousing the most primitive kind of anger. Yet it's a despicable movie, one that raises complex questions in order to offer bigoted, frivolous, oversimplified answers."
Death Wish,7,22000000,50,"The violence is excessive and the plot predictable, although there is some style to director Winner's approach."
Death Wish,7,22000000,40,Poisonous incitement to do-it-yourself law enforcement is the vulgar exploitation hook on which Death Wish is awkwardly hung.
The Adventures of Ford Fairlane,6.3,21413502,75,"The Adventures of the Ford Fairlane is an exceptionally well-made film that is everything you could ever want in an Andrew Dice Clay movie; it's vulgar, tasteless, nasty, cynical, and, at times, very funny."
The Adventures of Ford Fairlane,6.3,21413502,70,"Surprisingly funny and expectedly rude, this first starring vehicle by vilified standup comic Andrew Dice Clay has a decidedly lowbrow humor that is a sort of modern equivalent of that of the Three Stooges."
The Adventures of Ford Fairlane,6.3,21413502,63,"Though Clay is unbearably watchable, the mis-cast director means this comedy would be better as an action flick - it isn't funny but the violence is well executed."
The Adventures of Ford Fairlane,6.3,21413502,50,"Under the direction of ""Die Harder's"" Renny Harlin, the movie has a crackling pace and a glossy look. It's all the more pernicious for that, this slick glorification of hate and loathing that portrays women as sexually promiscuous and men as infantile, violent and feeble-minded. Here's one Ford that doesn't have a better idea."
The Adventures of Ford Fairlane,6.3,21413502,40,"If he wants a future in the movies, Andrew Dice Clay is going to have to play somebody other than himself."
The Adventures of Ford Fairlane,6.3,21413502,40,"Renny Harlin, who did a much better job directing ''Die Hard 2,'' displays no sense of humor and takes the film's nonsensical action scenes much too seriously, at one point even blowing up a beach house in the process."
The Adventures of Ford Fairlane,6.3,21413502,30,It's especially doomed by a strained script that recalls certain bottom-of-the-barrel Bob Hope vehicles of the 50s in its attempts to be brittle and self-mocking in its humor.
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,70,"Squeamish types may balk, but the gory cruelty on display here is faithful to the source material and deeply thrilling."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,63,"It has a certain commitment to its cause, and by that I mean it supplies the necessary flayings, slayings, beheadings and, um, a be-nose-ing, all of it dancing to the tune of those amusingly stilted He-Man declaratives - King James Bible cadences applied to comic-book visions. It knows it's a B movie, and gets on with it."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,60,"Brutal, bloody beyond belief, and has no socially redeeming value. So it is with a certain amount of guilt that I say it's kind of a wicked blast to watch, especially if you're in the mood for some righteous revenge."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,60,"The film's secret weapon proves to be Freddy Krueger–fingernailed witch Marique, whom Rose McGowan plays with the kind of fuck-it-all brio - imagine a cross between Madeline Kahn in ""History of the World: Part I"" and Lady Gaga - that should garner her a Razzie and an Oscar."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,50,"Conan the Barbarian has its small, insipid pleasures, if you're in the mood."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,50,"Mr. Momoa has some awfully big biceps to fill. He rises to that task with a pumped physique made for ogling. Thankfully, he also shows glints of self-awareness that can make hypermasculine blowouts like these more watchable and were largely missing from Mr. Schwarzenegger's wide-eyed turn in the first ""Conan the Barbarian"" (1982)."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,50,"Rife with the oldest and simplest pleasures of 3-D movies: all sorts of objects fly at the camera, and the climactic battle takes place over a deep, dark chasm. At its best the movie suggests a funhouse at a state-of-the-art county fair; at its worst it's a fairly dumb celebration of brute violence."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,50,"It's mostly noise and splurch and, as I mentioned, aaaaarrrrggggghhhhh!"
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,50,There's something and nothing for everyone in Conan the Barbarian 3D.
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,50,"Take away much of the myth, most of the sorcery and all of the humor of the 1982 John Milius-Arnold Schwarzenegger version of the sword and sorcery epic ""Conan the Barbarian"" and you've got an idea what the new  ""Conan"" is like."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,50,"The well-executed picture solves the biggest challenge facing those hoping to breathe new life -- however nasty, brutish and short -- into the 79-year-old franchise by finding an actor capable of filling Ah-nuld's shoes."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,45,"The movie's look is artificially grainy, and most of the scenes are encrusted with CGI - you'd have to chip it away with a chisel to get to anything human or interesting or even remotely fantastical."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,40,A gaudily ornamented medieval banquet table groaning with junk food and open entrails.
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,40,The bigger problem is that the action literally bleeds together and there's no sense of pacing.
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,38,"The 2011 version of Conan the Barbarian looks cheap and feels rushed. The few good elements are dwarfed by a generic, nonsensical plot and shoddy storytelling."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,38,"In today's cultural climate, any remake of Conan the Barbarian can only be considered (a) redundant or (b) a cruel case of rubbing salt in our cinematic wounds. Either way, it ain't a pretty sight – in fact, it's downright barbaric."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,38,"Those nostrils do a lot of Momoa's acting, to be honest. As right as he is looks-wise, Momoa falls short in attitude."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,38,"Conan the Barbarian lives by a pretty simple ethos: He lives, he loves, he slays. What he doesn't do, alas, is act."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,38,"As for the movie itself, it's tolerable."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,38,"A brutal, crude, witless high-tech CGI contrivance, in which no artificial technique has been overlooked, including 3-D."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,30,"The result is a somewhat functional blood feast for the exploitation crowd, but it's hardly a bead of sweat on the original's battered backside. Oh, and the score? Basil Poledouris' bombastic brass is still No. 1."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,30,"There's just not a lot to like here, with the exception of what may be one of the all-time best bad movie lines, one Conan utters to Tamara as a kind of personal credo: ""I live. I love. I slay. I am content."""
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,30,"There is no purpose to the film other than random blood splattering amid scenes of bondage, primitive savagery and S&M eroticism. The film is numbing and dumb with its hero indistinguishable from its villains."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,25,"Morgan Freeman's voice is heard as the narrator, which is in itself the stuff of parody. Then we listen and get lost within two sentences, because the narration is so poorly written that Freeman himself probably didn't know what he was talking about."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,25,"Momoa, a familiar face from ""Game of Thrones"" to ""Baywatch,"" has the muscles but not the imposing persona and barbaric presence that Conan requires."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,25,"It shouldn't, in other words, be that hard to make a good Conan movie. John Milius did a half-decent job with ""Conan The Barbarian"" in 1982, but this new film of the same name feels like a half-hearted revamp of virtually any of the Conan rip-offs that clogged up video-store shelves in the '80s."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,25,"The re-whatevered Conan the Barbarian feels unexpectedly low-rent, even with its multi-million-dollar backdrops and ear-splitting, rumbling soundtrack and (presumably post-converted) 3D imagery."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,20,With the most growling and grunting of any movie this summer - and that includes those apes perched atop the box office - Conan the Barbarian seems at times to have actually been made by barbarians.
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,20,"There are swords and sorcery, pirates and monsters, taxed bodices and taxing mythology. In other words, there's the bare minimum necessary to summon this dismal movie into existence."
The Black Cauldron,6.5,21288692,90,"The new boys know how to create wonderful transformations in a character's expression with a deft stroke or two, and they have mastered the deliciously parodistic plasticity required by the movements of their ever twisting-turning-tumbling creatures. Their pastoral scenes still glow with the old Disney sweetness, and the ones of foreboding glower with the old relish for the grotesque. They satisfy an older viewer's nostalgic feeling for his childhood's delight while fulfilling the younger crowd's need for a kind of magic the movies too rarely even try to provide of late. It is never too early to learn that animation is still the best special effect."
The Black Cauldron,6.5,21288692,80,"But there's still a great deal to love in The Black Cauldron. The untested animators Don Bluth left behind created some amazing sequences, including a dramatic scene of Taran's oracular pig, Hen Wen, being captured by pterodactyl-like gwythaints...For all its flaws, The Black Cauldron was a movie ahead of its time."
The Black Cauldron,6.5,21288692,80,A fun-but-uninspired swords-and-sorcery story.
The Black Cauldron,6.5,21288692,75,"Despite its drawbacks as entertainment, it remains one of the best technical cartoon features ever produced by Disney."
The Black Cauldron,6.5,21288692,75,"It's quite good, though by the impossible standards the film sets for itself it inevitably falls short: the character design is a little smudgy, the backgrounds are somewhat unimaginative, and the secret of Disney animation's unique depth—its impeccable perspectives and shadings—seems to have been irretrievably lost."
The Black Cauldron,6.5,21288692,70,"Technically brilliant though short on narrative, The Black Cauldron is a painless, old-fashioned way to take out the kids, and a triumph for the animation department at the Disney studio, where it has been in development for almost a dozen years."
The Black Cauldron,6.5,21288692,70,"The essential problem with The Black Cauldron is that the central human character in the story is a complete drip, making it difficult to root for his success at saving the world from ruination."
The Black Cauldron,6.5,21288692,63,"This is the 25th full-length animated feature from Walt Disney studios, and professionally put together as it is, many of the ingredients may seem programmed to those who have seen some of the others."
The Black Cauldron,6.5,21288692,60,"As usual it is technically excellent, but the charm, characterisation and sheer good humour that made features like Pinocchio and Jungle Book so enjoyable are sadly absent."
The Black Cauldron,6.5,21288692,50,"While more grim than most Disney films, it's not bleakness that gets in the way of The Black Cauldron succeeding; unmemorable protagonists, annoying sidekicks, an awkwardly episodic plot, and animation that ranges in appearance from impressive to cheap to unfinished take care of that."
The Black Cauldron,6.5,21288692,50,"By any hard measure, the $25 million animated Cauldron is not very original. The characters, though cute and cuddly and sweet and mean and ugly and simply awful, don't really have much to do that would remain of interest to any but the youngest minds."
The Black Cauldron,6.5,21288692,50,"Possibly not the worst animated feature the House Of Mouse has produced, but certainly stumbling around the darker recesses of the Disney vault."
Torque,4.1,21215059,80,"A terrific action picture, fast-moving, studded with great stunts and smart enough not to take itself too seriously. Amid a plethora of high-minded, big-deal, year-end Oscar contenders, it offers a welcome contrast (and respite)."
Torque,4.1,21215059,75,"The movie is a guzzle of yahoo-Mountain Dew empty-calorie satisfaction: A quick blood-sugar high, an eyeful of bikes and bosoms, and you're out of the theater in 80 minutes. And on a bleak winter's day, that can be meal enough."
Torque,4.1,21215059,75,"The movie is as adolescent as it sounds, but Kahn keeps your eyes popping with truly nonstop action and some of the most outlandishly inventive effects you've ever seen. And of course Cube is so supercool it's worth the price of admission just to watch him."
Torque,4.1,21215059,70,"Zippy, stylish fun."
Torque,4.1,21215059,67,The movie is simple fun.
Torque,4.1,21215059,63,The first three minutes convince us we're are looking at a commercial before the feature begins. Then we realize the whole movie will look like this.
Torque,4.1,21215059,63,"A good stupid movie: an energetic send-up of a discredited genre that does for motorcycle movies, say, what Jonathan Demme's debut, the 1974 drive-in classic, ""Caged Heat,"" did for chicks-in-prison flicks."
Torque,4.1,21215059,63,"Invites you not simply to identify with its low IQ but to cheer it on. This is a movie that knows you know it's dumb, and that's enough to make the whole thing worth tolerating."
Torque,4.1,21215059,60,"A spectacularly trashy and aggressively flashy motorcycle melodrama in which computer-enhanced action scenes, unbound by gravity or logic, are choreographed, photographed and edited to resemble video-game stratagems."
Torque,4.1,21215059,60,"The plot, characters, story and dialogue were all secondary - or lower. With this in mind, Torque really wasn't that bad. In fact, with this in mind, Torque was actually pretty good."
Torque,4.1,21215059,50,"The film occasionally pokes fun at itself, although not nearly as often as it should. I don't recommend it for anything more significant than a bottom-of-the-barrel rental or a desperation cable choice, but it delivers what it advertises, and I suppose that could be considered a virtue."
Torque,4.1,21215059,50,"The cycle thrills here are everything: flips, collisions, a chase across the top of a fast-moving train and even a zoom down the aisle of one of the train's cars as the passengers take it in stride."
Torque,4.1,21215059,50,"Purely an easy-to-digest testosterone flick anyway, with standard bikini babes, roaring engines and bikers who circle each other slowly in the dust before they rumble."
Torque,4.1,21215059,50,"Despite all the bike chases and bullet-dodging, the real sport here is Xtreme posing."
Torque,4.1,21215059,50,"Thankfully, Torque knows what it wants to be (which is more than you can say about other recent biker-boy flicks) and flashes a jocular self-awareness about its genre affiliation."
Torque,4.1,21215059,50,"Although the press notes liken the movie to ""Easy Rider"" (why not ""Lawrence of Arabia"" while you're at it?), the obvious comparison is to the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, which shares the same producer. Actually, the closest spiritual cousin may be ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure."""
Torque,4.1,21215059,40,"Torque knows its one big joke, dusty chaps, heaving bosoms, and all, which makes it all that much easier to swallow. And forget."
Torque,4.1,21215059,38,It may entertain you if you don't mind senseless stories and screaming soundtracks.
Torque,4.1,21215059,38,"It's a simple-minded celebration of speed that pretends to be nothing else, even throwing in the occasional wink to acknowledge its own silliness."
Torque,4.1,21215059,38,"Torque isn't a movie, it's an 81-minute soda commercial."
Torque,4.1,21215059,30,With the exception of a few dazzling special effects and a digitally enhanced camera move or two... it's also a towering bore.
Torque,4.1,21215059,30,"With the exception of a decent train-top chase, Torque is all vroom and no action."
Torque,4.1,21215059,30,"Delivers state-of-the-art freeway thrills tenuously held together by an absurd plot, cheap but pretty leads (Martin Henderson, Monet Mazur), diner and gas station locations that look like they've been preserved in amber since the 1950s, and plenty of engine porn."
Torque,4.1,21215059,30,"For a movie that's supposed to be about speed and movement, Torque is a peculiarly slow kind of torture. Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition -- especially not in an action movie."
Torque,4.1,21215059,30,"By Monday, Torque will look like a period piece with its expiration date, January 2004, prominently displayed. The inevitable movie-inspired video game will appear more realistic."
Torque,4.1,21215059,30,"The loudest, trashiest, stupidest, cheesiest celebration of ritualized male aggression of 2004."
Torque,4.1,21215059,25,"It's only January, but already we have a strong candidate for the most thunderingly stupid movie of the year."
Torque,4.1,21215059,20,"The final irony is that it's tailored for a PG-13 audience: The violence is bloodless, the sex is all come-on and the surreally reckless stunts cater to viewers too young to drive."
Torque,4.1,21215059,20,"Torque has a sense of humor about itself, but the laughs stick in the throat."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,83,Damon's how-to-break-the-law lesson - as ludicrous as anything else in this enjoyably zigzaggy exercise in accumulating peril - grants Neeson the fun of experimenting with an American ex-con accent for his one scene.
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,80,"The characters are so vivid that the suspense never lags. Crowe is best in buttoned-down roles like this one, and he holds the husband's fear and resolve in balance."

The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,70,"In its final half-hour, all the stops are pulled. The movie is still wildly implausible but at least it's hurtling forward. The only thing missing from the proceedings is a windmill for John to tilt at."

The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,60,"Okay, but it lacks conviction."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,60,"Slick, well acted and engaging. It's also morally bankrupt--a film that makes you feel as though you've been taken for a smooth ride by the Hollywood machine and dropped somewhere very nasty."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,60,"The increasingly unlikely escapades culminate in a finale that's as narratively lazy as it is morally questionable, lending further credence to the voices that proclaimed Haggis absurdly overpraised for the 2004 Oscar-winner ""Crash."""

The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,50,"Once the second act begins with a title card announcing ""The Last 3 Months""-the amount of time John spends cooking up labyrinthine plans to spring Lara-Haggis's film becomes interminably nonsensical."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,50,"Although involving, this remake of a recent French film never reaches the anticipated heights of excitement and suspense."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,50,"The movie was written and directed by Oscar winner Paul Haggis (Crash) and when stripped to its logline, it's pretty ridiculous."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,50,"Paul Haggis' middling fourth feature evinces a sometimes pulse-quickening fascination with procedural details, and climaxes with a good dose of swift, suspenseful filmmaking. But what was briskly diverting in the original has been rather laboriously overworked."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,50,"Paul Haggis is positive that withholding information while John makes ""A Beautiful Mind"" flow charts and deals with bad dudes will keep it interesting. Haggis is wrong."

F/X2,5.8,21082165,80,"The craftsmanship that went into the making of this film has to have been formidable, yet a key part of its enjoyment is its throwaway, unpretentious charm."
F/X2,5.8,21082165,75,"FX 2 is entertaining enough, but lacks the zip and wit of the original."
F/X2,5.8,21082165,63,"The story line is little more than a shiny hat for holding the high-tech rabbits. Still, it's an enjoyable bit of smoke and mirrors, thanks to the decency and resourcefulness of its hero."
F/X2,5.8,21082165,60,"It's all totally farfetched and skates imperturbably over several questions of logic that will spring unbidden to the most accepting mind. But it's entertaining, inconsequential fun."
F/X2,5.8,21082165,60,"There should be a special category for movies that are neither good nor bad, but simply excessive."
F/X2,5.8,21082165,50,"As long as it is fixated on gadgetry, FX2 is reasonably entertaining. But when the movie focuses on plot and character, it turns quite dotty in an amiable way."
F/X2,5.8,21082165,50,A big-screen version of a routine cop show that occasionally gets by on momentum from the original movie.
F/X2,5.8,21082165,50,The movie itself is convoluted and almost unbelievably lackluster.
F/X2,5.8,21082165,50,"Valiantly tries to recapture the spit and polish indie feel of the original, and comes up looking more like something Franklin might have directed on a Bad Day."
F/X2,5.8,21082165,50,"With all the ingenuity that went into toys and gadgetry in this five-years-removed sequel, it’s a shame no one bothered to hook a brain up to the plot."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,70,"Live and Let Die borrowed from blaxploitation; The Man with the Golden Gun took a couple of kicks at kung fu, though in a distinctly half-hearted fashion."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,63,"Rarely does The Man with the Golden Gun take anything seriously. Mary Goodnight is as clumsy as they come. Pepper and Nick Nack are cartoonish. There are more jokes-per-minute than in any other Bond film. Even John Barry's score is less earnest than usual, and the opening song is ridiculous."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,60,Whilst this takes itself a little too lightly it has a lot going for it.
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,60,"Enjoyment requires denying the increasingly problematic truth about Bond: As heroes go, 007 represents a bygone notion of the privileged white man taking what’s his and leaving destruction in his wake."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,50,"Roger Moore already seems winded in his second outing as Bond. And the film's comedic approach to martial arts justly rankles true 007 afficionados. Compensation comes in the form of Christopher Lee's delicious take on evil as Scaramanga and Herve Villechaize's verve as Nick Nack, Scaramanga's dwarf manservant."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,40,"Mr. Moore functions like a vast garden ornament. Pedantic, sluggish on the uptake, incapable of even swaggering, he's also clumsy at innuendo. If you enjoyed the early Bond films as much as I did, you'd better skip this one."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,40,"Roger Moore's interpretation of Bond is blandness personified. It is left to Christopher Lee, playing a kind of Westernised, Dracula-esque Fu Manchu, to lend some semblance of style and suavity as Scaramanga, the man with a hideout in Red China and a hankering after the status of gentleman."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,40,Roger Moore is a pastry chef's idea of James Bond; but Christopher Lee as the archetype of the evil antagonist makes this 007 outing just about bearable.
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,40,"Screenwriters Maibaum and Mankiewicz attempted to downplay the gadgetry this time around, but their attempts at adding more humor hinder plot development. The film's pace lags until the climactic finale."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,40,Roger Moore's second outing as 007 does not do the subject matter justice. Or the character. Or any paying member of the audience.
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,63,"The director, Martin Weisz , doesn't lean on a lot of noise and editing tricks. He can relax, since all the scares are built into the Cravens' script, which invokes both ""Goonies"" and last year's instant-classic, chicks-versus-cave-dwelling-vampires flick ""The Descent."""
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,60,Pretty solid gory horror.
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,58,"A retro horror-comedy featuring quick deaths and cheapo-looking gore, with a few dorky laughs and gross-outs but not so many scares."
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,50,"Though written by Wes Craven and his son, Jonathan Craven, this is pretty standard stuff: A lot of creeping through dark tunnels with just enough characterization to help you keep track of who's still alive, but not enough gore to really satisfy fans of Aja's bloodbath."
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,50,"The politics of ""Hills 2"" won't enlist any new converts to the horror ranks, but existing fans will be drawn to the combination of visceral tension, violent payoff and the patented Craven gift for innovative gore."
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,50,It's not fun to watch.
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,50,"For anyone other than hardcore gore-hounds, this flipbook of deliberately invoked global-unrest horrors, from friendly-fire killings to rape as a breeding weapon, is effectively mean and unrelenting--and pretty far from fun."
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,40,"The film is brazenly indebted to old cowboys-and-Indians movies and to James Cameron’s ""Aliens."" Gleefully sensationalistic and paced like an adults-only shoot-'em-up video game, it's ultimately less interested in subversion and subtext than in making viewers squirm, shriek and throw up into their popcorn bags."
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,40,"The Hills Have Eyes 2 proves that even grisly, gory violence can be awfully boring."
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,38,"As a fan of the genre, and someone who genuinely loves such recent horror efforts as ""The Descent"" and ""The Host,"" I respectfully suggest that the atmosphere for horror movies might be better if moviemakers stopped making ones like this."
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,38,"The mutants are brain-damaged; the filmmakers don't have that excuse to justify this movie, which is the kind of thing the sergeant would call ""a stunning display of individual and group stupidity."""
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,38,A perfunctory gore fest and quite possibly the year's worst date movie.
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,30,You'd like to think such bankruptcy of imagination means we've seen the last of these subterranean creeps. But you know they'll be back soon to collect their royalties from the gore hounds who apparently don't care how dull or warmed over the accompanying package.
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,25,"After this disgrace, it's time to shut the hills' eyes for good."
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,25,"On the whole, this is an awfully long slog through very arid terrain, in which generic soldiers track, fight and try to escape from generic villains (you'd be surprised at how uninteresting mutant flesh-eaters can be). I can't speak for the hills, but I spent most of the movie just trying to keep my eyes open."
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,25,"Assembles the most motley group of incompetents this side of a ""Police Academy"" movie, yet somehow misses the laughs. But humorlessness is probably the least of the film's problems, lagging behind amateur-night performances from the no-name cast, a homogenous visual palette (and from a music-video director, no less!), and lots of pointless sadism."
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,20,As witless and simpleminded as the irradiated humanoids that serve as the franchise’s bad guys.
The Hills Have Eyes II,5.1,20804166,10,"This horror fanatic doesn't have room for Craven in his genre anymore. Collect your cash and call it a day already, Wes."
F/X,6.7,20603715,88,"This movie takes a lot of delight in being more psychologically complex than it has to be. It contains fights and shootouts and big chase scenes, but they're all firmly centered on who the characters are and what they mean to one another."
F/X,6.7,20603715,80,"A love of the world of movies permeates the first-class, crackling excitement of F/X, giving a rare dimension to this thriller."
F/X,6.7,20603715,75,F/X turns into a dazzling series of deceptions that border on being so topsy-turvy that one almost becomes frustrated with being fooled. But the script of Robert T. Megginson and Gregory Fleeman managed to stay on the right side of credibility and good humor enough of the time so that some rather obvious plot holes can be forgiven.
F/X,6.7,20603715,75,The action sequences are well staged and the twists and turns of the convoluted plot will keep viewers guessing. A competent and unpretentious entertainment.
F/X,6.7,20603715,75,"The movie, which looks as if it had been made on an A-picture budget, has a lot of the zest one associates with special-effects-filled B-pictures."
F/X,6.7,20603715,70,"Basic premise here is so strong that it proves well-nigh indestructable, even in the face of numerous implausibilities, some silly dialogue and less-than-great casting in secondary roles."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,75,"A moment's patience is soon rewarded by Anderson's vast store of rich, intoxicating imagery."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,60,"Stupid, with three o's. But also fun, never boring, and never insulting (to anyone other than Dumas) - unlike certain of the summer's A-pics…"
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,50,"It floats, but it's mainly filled with hot air."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,50,"Trash-action director Paul W.S. Anderson's (Alien vs. Predator) finds no cultural purpose for this rather literal adaptation of the Musketeers, but it's not so horrible it deserved to be protected from the cold eye of film critics."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,50,"A very 2011 take on Alexandre Dumas' classic that feels weirdly dated already. Although adequately entertaining thanks to lavish production values and game supporting perfs, this anodyne adaptation lacks a killer hook that would help it cross over to a demographic beyond action buffs and fanboys."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,42,"Beyond being unable to decide what kind of Musketeers movie it wants to be, Anderson's adaptation seems determined to underachieve as both heavy spectacle and light adventure. It's two mediocrities for the price of one."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,40,"Still, once you accept Paul W.S. Anderson's entirely unnecessary adaptation on its own terms (nonsensical, underachieving), it has its limited charms, which include a snigger-inducing alphabet soup of accents, a standout rooftop swordfight, and British comedian James Corden as the Musketeers' put-upon manservant."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,40,"Muskets and swords are a bit old-fashioned for the director of ""Resident Evil"" - Paul W.S. Anderson has added flying battleships and elaborate diamond heists. (With material as shopworn as this, an anachronizing approach seems as valid as any.)"
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,40,3D swashbuckler wields a disappointingly blunt sword.
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,38,"All the borderline pantomime acting and wigged buffoonery is deliberate and silly, but The Three Musketeers remains charmless, a romp brought down by its lead-footed script."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,35,"It's not the addition of airships and male dangly earrings that make Paul W.S. Anderson's take on Alexandre Dumas' classic, much-adapted adventure such a drag, it's everything else - the incoherence, the anvil-heavy dialogue, the lack of anything beyond the broadest of characterizations."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,30,The campy new screen adaptation of The Three Musketeers has all the reality and visceral excitement of a $75 million literary theme park dotted with fancy villages heavily patrolled by security.
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,30,"This one is overblown, over-dressed, and grandiosely dopey, packed with gargantuan sets and ludicrous action scenes and shot in unusually dark and dingy 3-D."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,25,"This is a once-in-a-lifetime fiasco, an epic fail like none we have seen this year, a bad idea by a very bad director and a career-crippling credit for all concerned. You don't want to miss it."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,25,This latest version is le pits.
Code of Silence,6.1,20345261,88,"The ads for Code of Silence look schlocky, and Chuck Norris is still identified with a series of grade-zilch karate epics, but this is a heavy-duty thriller - a slick, energetic movie with good performances and a lot of genuine human interest."
Code of Silence,6.1,20345261,75,"Chuck Norris takes a big leap in his film career with Code of Silence, a solid cops 'n' drug dealers picture filmed last year in Chicago. Norris' big step is that this time he stars in a much more realistic action film, one with a credibility only slightly undone by a few of his martial arts maneuvers at the end."
Code of Silence,6.1,20345261,70,A conventional cop thriller leavened with a tablespoon of style and a quarter-cup of garbagey fun.
Code of Silence,6.1,20345261,60,"Code of Silence, as directed by Andy Davis, has a slick look and adequate pacing, though its action sequences tend to fizzle as they end."
Action Jackson,5.3,20257000,50,Crashing through are several raffish characters whose acting doesn't get in the way of the stunts.
Action Jackson,5.3,20257000,50,"Flexploitation pure and simple -- nothing but savagery, sex and sinew."
Action Jackson,5.3,20257000,50,"First-class stunts, fine photography, and solid acting by Weathers and Vanity combine to lift this action film above its ludicrous story. Had the filmmakers not undermined the project with inane plot twists, unexplained motives, and absurd coincidences, this could have been a real winner."
Action Jackson,5.3,20257000,50,Weathers turns out to be a disappointingly weak lead whose low-key likability doesn't make up for his lack of anger and drive-crucial attributes for any action hero. And Baxley is surprisingly stingy with his action sequences.
Action Jackson,5.3,20257000,50,"Sometime stunt co-ordinator Baxley directs this feebly-scripted, sporadically exciting crime pic like a showpiece for his former speciality."
Action Jackson,5.3,20257000,40,"Action Jackson is a movie where some of the parts are good, but none of them fit and a lot of them stink. The movie tries for so many different effects in the course of its endless 94 minutes that I walked out feeling dizzy."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,67,"Ultimately of course, this is Statham’s show, and as always he doesn’t disappoint."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,63,"Luckily, Statham is up to the task. Which is a surprise, because he's never, ever done anything like this before."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,63,"A few months from now, no one will remember it, but Homefront isn't made for the long-haul. It's assembled simply for the 100 minutes when the viewer is in theater and, on a certain level, that's sufficient."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,63,"Sylvester Stallone can write entertaining formula action scripts like a demon, but he often hands them over to hack directors who don't know how to extract the pulp and the juice from them. On that score, Homefront is better than average."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,60,"[Jason Statham] has some nice, relaxed moments with onscreen daughter Izabela Vidovic, and gets to fulfil half his audience's fantasies in wiping the smirk from James Franco's face."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,60,"This meat-and-potatoes B-thriller stays modest and grounded: compared with the noisy excesses of higher-budgeted action flicks, it has a kind of crude integrity."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,60,"The movie is as blunt an instrument as the poster, but it’s also crammed with enough moving parts and unexpected distractions (Winona Ryder as a “meth whore”) to make it an indefensibly enjoyable piece of exploitation hackwork."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,60,[A] contemporary B-movie Western with designs on stylistic flair.
Homefront,6.5,20158492,50,"Statham and Franco, both well-known sleepwalkers on camera, seem more animated than usual. Suspend belief, and you’ll find Homefront predictable but entertaining."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,50,"The film is mostly predictable, but throws a few curveballs and ends up being surprisingly entertaining, if not at all outstanding."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,50,"The new Jason Statham movie Homefront aims to be retro, greasy comfort food but despite its lowly ambitions, there’s barely enough spice here to merit a decent burp."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,50,"Isn’t Statham’s best — or most brutal — work, but it’s not bad."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,50,"At its core, Homefront is thoroughly generic, a grim exercise in formula whose action sequences are edited into a frenetic, incoherent blur, especially the awful opening setpiece."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,50,"Despite being named “Gator Bodine,” Franco seems like something Statham would scrape off his boots. Put it this way: Franco needs a baseball bat to be intimidating; Statham just needs to be Statham."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,50,"Homefront has craft and humor behind it, but not much in the way of inspiration. Think of a dessert with lots of calories and no nutrition."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,50,This is a well-made thriller traveling over awfully familiar turf.
Homefront,6.5,20158492,45,Only completists need check in with Homefront. The rest of us can just stay home.
Homefront,6.5,20158492,42,The basic ingredients of a throwback action movie are all there; what’s missing is action and style.
Homefront,6.5,20158492,40,An unfathomably airless B-movie that betrays its USP by spreading the thrills too thinly. You can see why Stallone had second thoughts.
Homefront,6.5,20158492,40,"Another shake-and-bake Stath special, boasting the requisite punchy-fighty action and some pleasing sleaziness from Franco and Bosworth, but it's ponderously handled by director Fleder."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,40,The violence in Homefront is violence purely for entertainment's sake.
Homefront,6.5,20158492,40,"A thoroughly boilerplate bayou actioner, with one notable feature. It’s got good villains – nasty, delirious, stupid villains, among them Franco and Ryder – and for that it’s almost worth seeing. Almost."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,40,"Why introduce two female characters — played by Kate Bosworth and Winona Ryder, both excelling at trashy desperation — if the script’s ultimately going to forget them? The worst sin is visited upon Statham: Sure, those fists fly, but his poetry has become a chopped-up hash."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,40,"Statham is always good as the silent butt-kicking type and is fine here. Franco, as is often the case, seems to be acting in his own private movie and having a grand old time doing so; results for the audience may vary. Bosworth is good, scary skinny and wired for trouble as a menacing mom."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,38,"Boston University product Gary Fleder (“Kiss the Girls”) directs the action with grungy efficiency, and the movie does hook us with a certain lurid anticipation of just how far things might escalate."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,38,"Homefront is what ""Breaking Bad"" may have resembled had Sylvester Stallone written the TV show."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,38,"Homefront is done in by uninspired action scenes in which Statham’s athletic prowess is rendered unwatchable by hyper-editing, a shameful reliance on child-in-peril cliches to move the story forward, and so many loose ends that you wonder if 20 minutes were accidentally cut out from the movie."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,38,"Line to line, Stallone has a particularly numbing penchant for the f-word. But the key f-word in Homefront is ""familiar."""
Homefront,6.5,20158492,38,"The Jason Statham vehicle Homefront is such a generic tough-guy-against-the-odds ’80s style actioner that you’d swear Sly Stallone starred in it. He did, back in the day. Or versions of it.
This one, Stallone just scripted."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,38,"The material plays out like a particularly busy episode of Sons of Anarchy, possessing a peculiar joylessness that's anathema to the success of films like this."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,30,"Homefront is sufficiently silly and low-down to be entertaining on a certain marginal level, but it wouldn't appear that those involved, with the possible exception of Franco, approached this with the idea that they might be making good trash; it looks too elaborate and costly for that and the script exhibits no self-aware humor."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,30,"What sounds like a veritable B-movie wet dream — with that master of the subzero scowl, Jason Statham, starring in a screenplay written by Sylvester Stallone — turns out to be considerably less than the sum of its parts."
Homefront,6.5,20158492,25,It could have been crazy-good trash.
Homefront,6.5,20158492,20,Director Gary Fleder seems to sometimes suspect Homefront could pass as comedy.
Homefront,6.5,20158492,20,A disappointing mess of a genre flick.
Juice,7.1,20146880,83,The film is an inflammatory morality play shot through with rage and despair.
Juice,7.1,20146880,75,"There is a real terror in the faces of these kids as they realize that people have died, that guns kill, that your life can be ruined, or over, in an instant."
Juice,7.1,20146880,75,"The film winds up taking a clear anticrime stance, and Mr. Epps ably conveys Q's trepidation about his friends' behavior. But Juice also revels in the flash, irreverence and tough-guy posturing to which the film's violence can ultimately be traced."
Juice,7.1,20146880,75,Dickerson and co-writer Gerard Brown exhibit a sharp ear for dialog and have some real finds in their largely unknown cast.
Juice,7.1,20146880,75,"Dickerson's story of street kids at risk breaks no new ground. It is better than most, but not by much. Sure looks good, though."
Juice,7.1,20146880,70,"Though it is a vivid, promising piece of work from first-time director Ernest R. Dickerson, it also shows how difficult it's becoming to deal with this material in any kind of fresh manner."
Juice,7.1,20146880,70,"Poised halfway between the action conventions of ""New Jack City"" and the personal grit of ""Straight Out of Brooklyn,"" Juice doesn't have the pizzaz or the insight, to satisfy as either exploitation or art. Dickerson and his fresh young cast make it move; it just doesn't move very far."
Juice,7.1,20146880,67,"Dickerson's point in this passable but rather routine picture is that no one is exempt from the spidery grip of frustrations brought on by poverty and a life of depressed opportunities; that, given these circumstances, anyone can pick up a gun as the only answer to his problems."
Juice,7.1,20146880,67,"It's a perfectly competent film, but the title quantity is the one thing this dry and earnest movie hasn't got."
The Glimmer Man,5.4,20100000,75,"Although this slick Seagal action pic won't convert die-hard detractors, aficionados will note that he's both gained weight and lightened up."
The Glimmer Man,5.4,20100000,60,"The comedy is cruelly subliterate (powdered deer privates figure prominently), the action -- performed by an aging, dumpy Seagal -- pointless, and the story pieced together from moldy cliches."
The Glimmer Man,5.4,20100000,60,"As the plot gets even worse than that of a bad serial killer movie, not even the OK fight scene at the end can redeem it."
The Glimmer Man,5.4,20100000,50,"The plot of The Glimmer Man involves not only the Family Man but Our Evil Secret Government, the Russian Mafia and Rich Powerful Politicians -- the three stooges of action cinema in the '90s."
The Glimmer Man,5.4,20100000,50,"For a rock'em, sock'em action thriller, The Glimmer Man is a hopelessly slow-moving, slow-witted shaggy-dog tale that delivers the jolts but lacks the juice necessary for high-voltage entertainment."
The Glimmer Man,5.4,20100000,40,"Short on suspense, routine in its action and monotonous in its performances."
The Glimmer Man,5.4,20100000,40,"All-in-all, what we have here is classic Seagal. And that means, for anyone who isn't an admitted fan, an uninspired outing."
The Glimmer Man,5.4,20100000,40,"The Glimmer Man is simply a spectacular belly-flop of an action movie -- neither good enough nor bad enough to be anything but instantly forgettable, though not necessarily painless."
An Innocent Man,6.4,20047604,75,"You'll cheer, you'll laugh, you'll bite your nails and feel your heart pounding right up there under your crewcut."
An Innocent Man,6.4,20047604,75,"An Innocent Man isn't an inspired piece of filmmaking, but it is tightly focused and efficient, and on its own modest terms it is effective."
An Innocent Man,6.4,20047604,63,"The plot is almost as old as Hollywood itself, yet the film's ironic, cynical tone gives the material a new spin under the direction of veteran Peter Yates. The script is savvy about the power structures both inside and outside the prison gates, and the fine cast makes the most of the well-crafted dialog and sharply drawn characters."
An Innocent Man,6.4,20047604,63,"This 1989 movie looks much of the time like an old idea that's been too enthusiastically colorized. The prison sequences work best, and they seem almost like a completely separate film."
An Innocent Man,6.4,20047604,60,Outdated and predictable revenge saga.
An Innocent Man,6.4,20047604,50,"An Innocent Man has all the elements to put us through an emotional wringer, but the movie never works up any enthusiasm for them. It's the most relaxed crime movie of the year."
An Innocent Man,6.4,20047604,50,"More than enough sadism to go around. But the net effect is less excitement than overkill. The screenplay, by Larry Brothers, has a tendency to forget old plot elements as it picks up new ones."
An Innocent Man,6.4,20047604,50,"This cautionary thriller about an unjustly imprisoned airline mechanic has a chance to be a canny blend of gutsy melodrama and J'Accuse against the prison system. But, by the end, it has gone as slick and corrupt as the crafty old con (F. Murray Abraham) who advises Tom Selleck's framed Jimmie Rainwood on jail survival. On a fundamental moral level, An Innocent Man is guilty as hell."
An Innocent Man,6.4,20047604,40,"With the exception of Abraham's world-weary performance, and a couple of nicely nasty cameos from David Rasche and Richard Young as the crooked cops, this is a disposable affair. Yates' ham-fisted direction cranks the film up into melodramatic hyperbole, but Selleck is the real villan, portraying his transformation from wide-eyed innocent to hardened man of the world by changing from clean-shaven mop top to stubbly slicked-back, with reflecting shades to boot. Laughable."
An Innocent Man,6.4,20047604,38,This collection of cliches accomplishes the almost unthinkable by bringing the prison genre to a new low.
The Presidio,6,20036242,50,"It's a movie that doesn't have an original thought in its head, and seems to like it that way."
The Presidio,6,20036242,50,"As usual, Hyams makes good use of the locations, and stages the stunt sequences with great skill, but his handling of the romance and father/daughter conflicts is at best uncertain, at worst embarrassing."
The Presidio,6,20036242,40,"Tug-of-war for dominance among the trio provides the interest in an otherwise ordinary crime story, as Harmon and Connery end up working to piece together clues in a convoluted smuggling caper."
The Presidio,6,20036242,40,"The whole movie has the feeling of a clone, of a film assembled out of spare parts from other movies, out at the cinematic junkyard."
The Presidio,6,20036242,40,"It doesn't help that the mystery plot seems half-baked in the end, or that none of the actors appear entirely comfortable with their roles. Miss Ryan looks edgy and spends a lot of time tossing her hair. Mr. Harmon is easygoing and attractive, but his nice-guy manner belies his character's steely talk."
The Presidio,6,20036242,38,"It's an ultra-slick, ultra-flat movie that cuts like a cellophane knife. No edge, no blood."
The Presidio,6,20036242,30,"Doubling duties as director and cinematographer, Peter Hyams seems to have tossed the former for the latter. The Presidio, purported cop thriller, looks great. It is, in fact, less filling. The maker of ""Outland"" and ""2010"" infuses a San Francisco setting with evocative misty grays, but screenwriter Larry Ferguson's dull doings hang thicker than smog."
The Presidio,6,20036242,30,"A thoroughly uninvolving picture, THE PRESIDIO is chiefly the victim of a horrendous screenplay by Larry Ferguson (BEVERLY HILLS COP II; HIGHLANDER). When it isn't providing mundane dialog, Ferguson's script assaults the viewer with senseless exposition continuously dredged up from the characters' pasts."
Breathless,5.8,19910002,91,"But the slickness grows mesmeric and the performance unexpectedly wrenching as each trip Gere takes in a succession of classic cars brings him ever closer to his fate, a fate sealed the moment he drops a gun on top of a Silver Surfer comic while speeding through the desert to the accompaniment of Jerry Lee Lewis in the same type of Porsche that James Dean rode to his death."
Breathless,5.8,19910002,80,"A wanton, playful film, belying the stated despair by its boiling energy."
Breathless,5.8,19910002,80,"Breathless has a lot of mindless drive, but it's also funny. It's full of knowing quotes from other movies and from literature - William Faulkner in addition to Marvel Comics. It's less a film maker's journey of discovery than the film maker's testimony to his awareness of ''cinema,'' and sometimes it's just too much."
Breathless,5.8,19910002,75,"A suitably jazzy, sexy, entertainment."
Breathless,5.8,19910002,70,"Kaprisky, as the young French student, is an unknown in a role too large and complex for her, and there are times when she seems lost in a scene, looking to Gere for guidance. The result is a stylistic exercise without any genuine human concerns we can identify with - and yet, an exercise that does have a command of its style, is good-looking, fun to watch, and develops a certain morbid humor."
Breathless,5.8,19910002,70,"Much like Body Heat, which valorized noirish archetypes instead of examining their original social contexts, Breathless simply has a hard-on for Hollywood lore, as convertibles, rockabilly, and monochromatic lighting are utilized to enshrine dominant legacies rather than invert or, at least, probe them."
Breathless,5.8,19910002,63,"In keeping with the tentativeness of the entire enterprise, the ending is one of the great cop-outs in modern moviedom."
Breathless,5.8,19910002,50,"McBride's presentation of Richard Gere is frankly pornographic, perhaps the only way to handle this Victor Mature of the 80s; Valerie Kaprisky costars—meekly."
Léon,8.6,19501238,91,"Ah, monsieur, you can lead a Frenchman to the Big Apple, but you can't make him a New Yorker -- and that's exactly what makes The Professional so fascinating."
Léon,8.6,19501238,90,"Oldman is the least inhibited actor of his generation, and as this deranged detective, he keeps absolutely nothing in reserve."
Léon,8.6,19501238,80,Few action films can claim such complexities without conceding the bang-bang stuff that brings in the big money.
Léon,8.6,19501238,78,"Besson's visuals are, as always, vibrant and decidedly European. He fills the frames with odd-angled shots and alarming riots of color that catch you off-balance."
Léon,8.6,19501238,75,"With some surprisingly strong character interaction, there's a lot to like about this movie, at least for those willing to look beyond all the bloodshed."
Léon,8.6,19501238,70,Besson has a natural gift for plunging into drama with a charged-up visual style.
Léon,8.6,19501238,63,"Takes its viewers on a bouncing high-wire act between intense violence and sugar-sweet tenderness, with some light-hearted comedy along the way."
Léon,8.6,19501238,63,"Widescreen lensing favors tight close-ups, and multiple shoot-'em-ups are edited with panache."
Léon,8.6,19501238,60,"The sheer oddness of the New York world constructed for this film--where cops and crooks are literally interchangeable, and Oldman and Danny Aiello are stranded in roles that pick over the leavings of earlier parts--ultimately seems at once too deranged and too mechanical."
Léon,8.6,19501238,50,"Luc Besson is a masterly director of stylish, thrilling, and humorous action set pieces, and this film's bravura opening and closing sequences are two of the year's best."
Léon,8.6,19501238,50,"Lacks the sexy elan of ""La Femme Nikita"" and suffers from infinitely worse culture shock. [18 Nov 1994, p.C18]"

Timeline,5.6,19481943,50,"I felt too much of the movie consisted of groups of characters I didn't care about, running down passageways and fighting off enemies and trying to get back to the present before the window of time slams shut."
Timeline,5.6,19481943,50,"There's a modicum of charm to Timeline, since its eager, earnest tone harks back to Donner's work from the '80s, particularly ""The Goonies"" and ""Ladyhawke."""
Timeline,5.6,19481943,50,"Plays out like a 1950s B-movie with a fat special-effects budget. Brain-numbing dialogue, incoherent action and glaring improbabilities aside, it's a bearable combination of sci-fi paranoia and historical fantasy that drags modern viewers, and the robotic hero of ""The Fast and the Furious"" movies, Paul Walker, back to the centre of the Hundred Years War."

"I, Frankenstein",5.1,19075290,50,"If it touches on notions of scientific arrogance and the question of what makes us human, it ultimately does so lightly, and with a mix of eye-popping action and loopy good humor."
"I, Frankenstein",5.1,19075290,50,"Ambitious of vision and swooping of camera, I, Frankenstein is no ""I, Robot,"" let alone ""I, Claudius,"" but it’s definitely watchable on a cold Jan. evening or, a few months from now, on your I, Pad."
"I, Frankenstein",5.1,19075290,50,"With no clear idea how to end the movie, which has come to resemble an excessive episode of Buffy, the Vampire Slayer, writer/director Stuart Beattie (G.I.

"I, Frankenstein",5.1,19075290,50,"If the film is made with the understanding that campiness needs to be straight-faced to be funny, then are its “unintentional” laughs really that unintentional?"
"I, Frankenstein",5.1,19075290,50,"To be fair, Eckhart is physically impressive and Bill Nighy and his raised eyebrow do their best in the role of demon leader Naberius. But I, Frankenstein shares something else with it's monster-hero, something much worse than its patchwork nature: The film is distinctly lacking in the soul department."
"I, Frankenstein",5.1,19075290,40,"I, Frankenstein is nowhere near as garishly, ghoulishly awful as ""Van Helsing,"" Universal’s last attempt to resurrect its classic monsters. It’s a grimly fiendish slog nonetheless, and hardly worth getting up out of the grave for."

"I, Frankenstein",5.1,19075290,30,"Director/screenwriter Stuart Beattie, adapting the graphic novel by Kevin Grevioux, employs a strictly humorless, gothic approach to the material that makes one long for the satirical touches of James Whale, let alone Mel Brooks."

Beneath the Planet of the Apes,6.1,18999718,63,"The craziest installment of the Apes series starts out as an almost point-for-point remake of the 1968 original, somehow making it even darker and stranger."
Beneath the Planet of the Apes,6.1,18999718,60,Those with the patience to sit through a slow first half will be rewarded with another gutsy ending.
Beneath the Planet of the Apes,6.1,18999718,60,"This sequel to Planet of the Apes isn't bad, but degenerates the original conception into routine comic strip adventure."
Beneath the Planet of the Apes,6.1,18999718,50,"A disappointing, quickie follow-up that vainly tries to imitate the look of the original on an obviously limited budget, and for the most part, eschews the philosophical, social, and racial subtext of the first film in favor of straightforward shoot-em-up action and comic-strip characters."
Beneath the Planet of the Apes,6.1,18999718,50,"The original Planet of the Apes is a hard act to follow, and Beneath the Planet of the Apes isn’t really up to the challenge."
Beneath the Planet of the Apes,6.1,18999718,50,"A workmanlike sequel, it lacks the wit and intelligence of its predecessor."
Beneath the Planet of the Apes,6.1,18999718,42,Beneath The Planet Of The Apes is a joyless retread that at least has the distinction of ending with the nuclear annihilation of Earth.
Beneath the Planet of the Apes,6.1,18999718,40,"I’m not sure that the story is the right receptacle for big notions about imperialism, racism, militarism, the balance of power, religiosity, the end of reason; it is a bit like loading the history of philosophy into an egg-and-spoon race."
Beneath the Planet of the Apes,6.1,18999718,40,"This sequel to the 1968 smash, Planet of the Apes, is hokey and slapdash. The story [by Paul Dehn and Mort Abrahams] and Ted Post’s direction fall far short of the original."
Above the Law,6,18869631,75,"As in his previous film, Davis gets mileage out of supporting players who do not look or sound like professional actors and so add a level of realism to the action."
Above the Law,6,18869631,67,"He's the anticop, one blood-soaked, quasi-psychotic symptom of Hollywood's desire to outgun, outkill and out-carchase itself."
Above the Law,6,18869631,60,"Davis' direction is Miami Vice-tight, though with frequent attempts at humour: this, together with the caricature psycho-baddie (Silva), and the mixture of spectacular, bone-crunchingly realistic violence with a stab at topical socio-political commentary, makes for a very uncertain tone."
Above the Law,6,18869631,50,A slam-bang action film with some stunning scenes of mayhem and violence.
Above the Law,6,18869631,50,"With a couple dozen stunt persons and an earthy, warm and supportive partner (Pam Grier), Seagal kicks, kills and crushes with his skillful hands one handful after another of street hoods who try and thwart his mission."
Above the Law,6,18869631,50,"The action sequences are sleek and strong enough, but the story that chains them together is too ambitious for its own good"
Above the Law,6,18869631,50,"Woefully short on originality, intelligibility and anything resembling taste. But none of this comes as a surprise. What is surprising is how little invention or energy there is in the movie's action sequences."
Above the Law,6,18869631,50,"Come the end of the year, Above the Law may well rank among the top three or four goofiest bad movies of 1988."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,50,"There's a fun retro camp to Hercules, with nods to classics such as Ben-Hur and Spartacus, as Hercules finds himself rowing slave ships and crossing desert expanses."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,40,The action comes thick and fast but the storyline is generic and Lutz makes a particularly dull hero. An Erymanthian bore.
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,40,"Renny Harlin's Legend of Hercules fulfills every silly, flimsy promise that it makes in the first place: There are lots of battles (albeit rather jerkily rendered ones), some grand-looking horses decked out in handsome metal headdresses, and lots of well-oiled beefcake."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,40,"This movie, with its relatively modest running time and not-quite-household-name cast, is no more ridiculous than, let’s say, the “Thor” movies, and a lot less pretentious."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,40,"Like so many of today’s action films, The Legend of Hercules is too busy peddling slick, stone-faced portent to ever bother making us laugh, or engaging us in any way."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,39,"While the art of action filmmaking depreciates, Harlin remains steadfast in his classicism, even if the movie doesn’t have the foundation to support him."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,38,"While Lutz might possess the beefcake to fill out his chest armor, he lacks the acting chops to make us much care about the fate of his gleaming hero who looks as if he just stepped out of a Beverly Hills salon."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,38,"Given its virtuous subject matter and the relative bloodlessness of its violence, perhaps Renny Harlin means for this film to be a means of atoning for his previous cinematic sins."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,38,"At times, with its stiff, charisma-impaired cast, its digital sets and slo-mo slaughter, The Legend of Hercules has a whiff of the Augean Stables about it — if you catch my drift."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,30,"Lutz’s acting muscles aren’t nearly as well developed as his pectorals and deltoids, and while the role may not call for a master thespian, it at least begs someone who can emote without looking like he’s straining to execute a dead lift."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,25,"While The Legend Of Hercules offers plenty for viewers who’ve acquired a taste for the fake and incompetent (not the least of which is the dialogue, which finds characters saying each other’s names at the end of every other sentence), it’s unlikely to please anyone who wants entertainment in the conventional sense."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,20,"While watching it, I kept thinking this was like ""47 Ronin,"" in which an unfortunate novice director was given a project way out of his or her reach. In no way was I prepared to learn it was the work of veteran Harlin."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,20,"If you admire Kellan Lutz's chiseled body, The Legend of Hercules does offer plenty of that in 3-D glory."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,20,"Where 300 made a virtue of its low budget by stripping the visuals down to their essential elements, the shot-in-Bulgaria Legend Of Hercules mostly just looks rushed and cheap, only coming to life in a handful of fight scenes, and then only briefly."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,20,"If The Legend of Hercules were just a little more inept or over-the-top, it might have been ridiculous fun. As it is, unfortunately, Harlin embraces the mediocrity of the screenplay with a dour straight face, draining it of any enjoyably camp possibilities."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,16,A movie so ugly and woeful that you'll wish you had superhuman strength to pluck your own eyeballs out of your head.
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,12,The only thing epic about The Legend of Hercules is what a failure it is.
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,10,"The whole thing is a total bore; even the supporting players aren’t motivated enough to attract attention. That’s good news for Lutz; he can’t be blamed for torpedoing the project, because everyone is doing subpar work here."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,0,"This ludicrously written, buffoonishly acted, irritatingly filmed sword-and-sandals epic hasn't half the sand, sweat or saltiness of other titles in the genre."
The Quick and the Dead,6.4,18636537,75,"Ms. Stone's presence nicely underscores the genre-bending tactics of Sam Raimi, the cult director now doing his best to reinvent the B-movie in a spirit of self-referential glee. Mr. Raimi is limited by a sketch mentality, which means his jokes tend to be over long before his films end. But his tastes for visual mischief and crazy, ill-advised homage can still make for sly, sporadic fun."
The Quick and the Dead,6.4,18636537,75,"Hip, jokey western from cult director Sam Raimi.   Recommended as an antidote to anyone still suffering from Wyatt Earp hangover."
The Quick and the Dead,6.4,18636537,70,"Sam Raimi tries to do a Sergio Leone, and though this 1995 feature is highly enjoyable in spots, it doesn't come across as very convincing, perhaps because nothing can turn Sharon Stone into Charles Bronson."
The Quick and the Dead,6.4,18636537,63,"This ankle-deep story has a cheekful of tongue, providing opportunities galore for hammy, quick-draw melodrama and the perfect vehicle for Ms. Stone."
The Quick and the Dead,6.4,18636537,63,"As preposterous as the plot was, there was never a line of Hackman dialogue that didn't sound as if he believed it. The same can't be said, alas, for Sharon Stone, who apparently believed that if she played her character as silent, still, impassive and mysterious, we would find that interesting. More swagger might have helped."
The Quick and the Dead,6.4,18636537,63,"If movies were rated solely on the basis of style, The Quick and the Dead would score highly indeed. With its dazzling photography, inventive camera angles, and throbbing bass score, the film is an experience for the eyes and ears. Director Sam Raimi and cinematographer Dante Spinotti have woven a beautifully elaborate tapestry: colorful and evocative -- and depressingly two-dimensional."
The Quick and the Dead,6.4,18636537,63,"Quick and the Dead plays like a crazed compilation of highlights from famous westerns. Raimi finds the right look but misses the heartbeat. You leave the film dazed instead of dazzled, as if an expert marksman had drawn his gun only to shoot himself in the foot."
The Quick and the Dead,6.4,18636537,60,"Yet all this work, all this skill, serve as little more than an elaborate setting for a rhinestone. At its core there is no passion, no sincerity of conception, nothing that might have made The Quick and the Dead into anything more than moment-to-moment stimulation. You get lots of clothes here, but no emperor. Or rather, no empress."
The Quick and the Dead,6.4,18636537,60,"The Quick and the Dead takes on a more serious tone - as if, even in this loonily amoral environment, we're supposed to care about atrocities. The film builds to a satisfyingly catastrophic climax full of biblical flames and fluttering bank notes, but there's far too much dead time along the way."
The Quick and the Dead,6.4,18636537,60,"The Quick and the Dead is made bearable by director Sam Raimi, who bombards us with frenetic editing, crazy-angle shots and enjoyably cartoonish cliches. But all the stylistic sleight of hand in the world can't hide the central problem: The star of the show is more Dead than Quick."
The Quick and the Dead,6.4,18636537,50,"The Quick and the Dead is too light to pack the dramatic punch of a true Western and too flat to pass as cheeky revisionism. It ends up in its own amiable, slowpoke limbo."
The Quick and the Dead,6.4,18636537,50,"It's a mess, and one that even the pickled cowboys behind me found yawningly tedious, and that's not something I ever thought I'd be saying about a Sam Raimi movie with the word “dead” in the title."
The Quick and the Dead,6.4,18636537,50,"The Quick and the Dead is showy visually, full of pans and zooming close-ups. Rarely dull, it is not noticeably compelling either, and as the derivative offshoot of a derivative genre, it inevitably runs out of energy well before any of its hotshots runs out of bullets."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,75,"Man on a Ledge doesn't aim high, but what it aims to do, it does. It grabs the audience's attention, engages its anxieties, stokes its resentments and, at the finish, sends people out saying, ""That was good."""
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,70,"Leth moves lightly and briskly, streamlining the weird material into something elemental and true; he's also assembled a knockout supporting cast."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,65,"Either in spite of or because of its whimsically convincing quality, Man on a Ledge is reasonably fun to watch along the way."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,63,"On balance, Man on a Ledge is fun, but I left the theater feeling disappointed and cheated, as if the filmmakers set me up for something great they ultimately couldn't deliver."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,60,"The ending, for instance, is so ridiculously tidy it squeaks. But en route to its kitchen-sink climax, ""Man"" manages to both amuse and provoke, to cleave to convention and promote ideas."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,60,It's fun in a perverse way; the viewer gets to experience a vivid sense of what it feels like to occupy a pigeon-poop smeared piece of stone high in the sky.
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,60,"Clichés and thin thrillers are what we can expect from January releases and while Man on a Ledge has predictability to spare, it also has something that makes your time spent worthwhile: legitimate suspense."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,"As in the mindless Man on a Ledge, the hero is never really in danger, we're the ones who are trapped."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,"As ridiculous as it is, Man on a Ledge isn't a movie that requires suspension of disbelief. It requires the absolute absence of it."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,The film aims for Hitchcock and gets a bit turned around; we're The Audience That Knew Too Much.
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,"None of it rings true, except perhaps the presence of an ambitious local TV news reporter (Kyra Sedgwick) who begins recording every macabre moment with relish."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,"In Man on a Ledge, Leth does well in taking us to dizzying heights. If only he had found a way to ground that thrill in some real pathos as well."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,"The supporting players in Man on a Ledge bring more to the party than the leads, and my suspension of disbelief seems to have gotten hung up in traffic while attempting to cross the suspension-of-disbelief bridge from the Brooklyn side."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,The movie cuts back and forth between two preposterous plot lines and uses the man on the ledge as a device to pump up the tension.
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,Despite the occasional dumb fun - especially with the heist portions - the leap of logic required to make it all work is enough to leave your brain pancaked on the sidewalk.
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,"To his credit, director Asger Leth (Ghosts of Cite Soleil) gets right to the business at hand where the set-up is concerned, but it's in the execution that this would-be thriller falls flat."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,"This cloddishly contrived suspenser is too busy to bore, but too farfetched to thrill, combining routine heist-thriller machinations with dialogue that often thuds like a body hitting asphalt."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,42,"Man on a Ledge makes bigger leaps of logic than Nick will if he fails a gravity test. If the transparent sting springing him from Sing Sing doesn't roll your eyes, then wait for the climax when Nick becomes a kind of plainclothes Spider-Man."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,40,"Screenwriter Pablo Fenjves start with a promising premise, and the opening scenes are taut and suspenseful. A late-day chase scene picks up the sagging middle, but Leth totally fumbles what should be the movie's biggest moment."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,40,"Too bad. You sense that someone could have made a good movie with this material. Unfortunately, Leth didn't."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,40,"In the end it's all much ado about not so much, a semifunctional thriller that tingles but never terrifies. Ledge schmedge."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,40,"Trusting an action drone like Worthington to anchor the human drama is a fatal mistake. With him perched on that narrow slab of concrete, it's only a matter of time before the film plummets."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,38,"Man on a Ledge has its diverting moments, but by the time it has reached its too-pat final twist, it turns out to be a title desperately in search of a movie."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,38,"What follows is a jumble of cop- and heist-movie clichés, dotted with appearances by actors you liked in something else."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,38,"More often the film succumbs to clichés, grows convoluted and outlandish, and winds up dead on arrival."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,38,You could cast this movie with potato chips and still get cheers when one of the bad guys is cuffed. It doesn't matter that none of it is to be believed.
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,38,"The script is a hot mess of the highest order, taking some of the stalest chestnuts in the long, venerated legacy of the framed-cop-trying-to-clear-his-name genre and somehow f---ing it up, in scene after scene after scene."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,33,"As the plot unfolds, brick by brick, the structure starts to wobble until it finally collapses into unintentional comedy."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,30,"Worthington wouldn't know how to behave if the film were a comedy; and poor Banks, after a promising, ""Young Adult""–style introduction, isn't allowed to goose the script or push beyond the glass ceiling of her character."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,25,"The shopworn script by Pablo F. Fenjves, who ghost-wrote the unpublished O.J. Simpson book, If I Did It: The Confessions of the Killer, gets no help from director Asger Leth (Ghosts of Cite Soleil)."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,25,Man on a Ledge just made me think of an old Van Halen song: Jump.
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,10,Rarely has a film exhibited a bigger disconnect between urban realism and utter ludicrousness.
Next,6.2,18211013,80,"Directed by Lee Tamahori with his customary flash and glitter, Next lives from one brilliantly executed chase sequence to the next, which is more than enough reason to stay the course."
Next,6.2,18211013,75,Wildly ridiculous and thoroughly entertaining thriller.
Next,6.2,18211013,63,A watchably absurd popcorn flick about a man who can see two minutes into the future.
Next,6.2,18211013,63,This isn't a bad movie; it's watchable but the direction in which the filmmakers choose to take it results in a vague sense of dissatisfaction.
Next,6.2,18211013,50,"Next begins to seriously embarrass itself and its stars -- except for Biel, surprisingly, who manages to escape with a shred of dignity, possibly because her role requires little beyond looking gorgeous -- once it rolls to its climax."
Next,6.2,18211013,50,"Tamahori attempts to cover the ludicrousness of the story with a wickedly fast pace and sensational action set pieces. And in a film more than an hour and half long, events do whiz by."
Next,6.2,18211013,50,"It starts exploring different facets of its premise and transforms itself into a fairly competent suspense thriller. That's enough to make it respectable, but a few things keep Next from being lovable or memorable."
Next,6.2,18211013,50,"Ultimately, Next is just the next Nic Cage vehicle, another quirky story that allows him to do his patented neurotic balancing act in an askew world. The problem here is not just that Cage's shtick is wearing as thin as his hair; the role is a bad fit."
Next,6.2,18211013,50,Next may be the silliest movie of 2007.
Next,6.2,18211013,50,"It's noisy, nonsensical, and will fade from your consciousness even before you make it out of the theater lobby, but it's entertaining enough, and Tamahori throws us a few curve balls to keep things interesting."
Next,6.2,18211013,50,"Next bears some resemblance to another Dick adaptation, ""Minority Report,"" about ""pre-cogs"" who can anticipate murders before they happen, but it doesn't really bother exploring the moral or emotional implications of Cage's power."
Next,6.2,18211013,50,What starts out as a mildly diverting thriller blows itself to smithereens in the final reel.
Next,6.2,18211013,40,"In Next, a crummy action and speculative-fiction hybrid, Nicolas Cage plays a guy who can see into the future two minutes at a time. It's too bad that Mr. Cage couldn't tap into those same powers of divination to save himself from making yet another inexplicably bad choice in roles."
Next,6.2,18211013,40,"Next is clearly an attempt at a puzzle movie, one of those brainteaser pictures that lures viewers into another dimension, but it doesn't have the momentum, the quick-wittedness, to keep us wondering what's going to happen next."
Next,6.2,18211013,40,"Despite an outlandish premise, Next suffers from being too conventional."
Next,6.2,18211013,40,"For an action thriller based on a Dick story, Next is peculiarly low-tech and hokey."
Next,6.2,18211013,38,Misbegotten mess.
Next,6.2,18211013,38,"Next, which makes ""National Treasure"" look like a model of narrative logic, is almost beyond criticism."
Next,6.2,18211013,38,This implausible action thriller also stars Julianne Moore as an FBI agent who sees Cage's two-bit Vegas act and decides he can single-handedly save the world.
Next,6.2,18211013,30,"This pseudo-Phildickian actioner is chum for the bigger fish to come this summer; for Moore, it's a slummer."
Next,6.2,18211013,30,"When the story finally collapses in a heap at the end, you'll probably want your money back, but that's where the title comes in: ""Next!"""
Next,6.2,18211013,25,An immediately forgettable action pic directed with a blowtorch by Lee Tamahori.
Next,6.2,18211013,25,"As a thriller, Next goes a certain distance on Cage's sad-sack charm and sense of humor, but it does nothing with its intriguing premise, and it's mostly just one more tedious and progressively dumb collection of Hollywood action clichés."
Postal,4.5,18005198,60,It's such an insanely fun ride that most of its flaws are forgivable.
Postal,4.5,18005198,50,"Not only less than horrible, but actually occasionally enjoyable."
Postal,4.5,18005198,42,"A provocation first, an insult second, a publicity stunt third, and a film a distant fourth."
Postal,4.5,18005198,40,This anything-goes exercise isn't dull -- one just wishes the outrageousness were more consistently funny.
Postal,4.5,18005198,38,"Postal's touches of wit are lost in the flying body parts, gross-out gags, and the full frontal spectacle of Foley's no-longer-private parts."
Postal,4.5,18005198,25,What Boll gives us is a boring beating over the head.
Postal,4.5,18005198,25,At last: Uwe Boll has made his first intentionally funny film.
Postal,4.5,18005198,20,"Manages to be as toothless as he (Boll) is tasteless. Poorly framed, tone-deaf, and nonsensical (yet still Boll's best!)."
Postal,4.5,18005198,10,"Infantile, irreverent and boorish to the max, Postal explodes with bad attitude and lousy filmmaking."
Postal,4.5,18005198,10,"Boll's rampant narcissistic showmanship creates such a bizarre, garish spectacle that it is almost tempting to give him credit for being something of a misunderstood artist after all. Almost, but not quite."
Postal,4.5,18005198,0,"Where Boll's movies were once amusingly atrocious, Postal is so aggressively tasteless and knowingly idiotic, there's just no fun to be had."
The Delta Force,5.6,17768900,75,"I thought this was going to be another hilarious disaster movie, but I was wrong. The Delta Force settles down into a well-made action film that tantalizes us with its parallels to real life."
The Delta Force,5.6,17768900,70,The movie is not Oscar caliber by any means. The acting is spare and without much passion.. Sure the movie is worth one or two stars at best. But it's a hell of a ride nonetheless.
The Delta Force,5.6,17768900,50,Students of minimal acting techniques can compare Marvin and Norris: impassivity versus vacancy. Students of the disaster film should write a short thesis on why George Kennedy is ubiquitous. Everyone else might wonder why the film is so virulently anti-Arab.
The Delta Force,5.6,17768900,40,"Golan barely touches on the fundamental conflicts that created the situation there and simply offers a pack of wild-eyed, swarthy Arabs preying on passive, middle-aged Jews represented by the likes of Winters, Balsam, Bishop, and Kazan. Such horrors do happen, but they do not have to be presented as a cartoon."
The Delta Force,5.6,17768900,40,"The 1986 film all others will have to beat for sheer, unashamed, hilariously vulgar vaingloriousness."
The Delta Force,5.6,17768900,30,"Golan and Bruner, in other words, have made the Holocaust into just another tear-jerking tool for the Cannon Productions shlockenspiel. This is called ""chutzpah."" The unoffended will find that the movie doesn't even deliver on its own sordid level. There isn't any action till 70 minutes into the film."
The Delta Force,5.6,17768900,30,The script plays like ''The Dirty Dozen'' saving the passenger list of ''Airport `77.''
The Postman,6,17626234,60,"Although The Postman conveys a thoroughly imagined vision of a future society, its basic concerns are actually far from those of traditional sci-fi, as it quickly comes to feel more like a Western than anything else."
The Postman,6,17626234,50,"If you take The Postman at face value - that it's a straightforward, post- apocalyptic adventure tale, then it could seem like one of the worst movies of the year, if not of all time."
The Postman,6,17626234,50,It's tempting to accuse director and star Kevin Costner of taking the idea of vanity production to a new level in this frontier adventure based on a book by David Brin.
The Postman,6,17626234,40,"Regrettably, The Postman is just one more reminder of what a nonfactor sincerity often is in terms of artistic merit."
The Postman,6,17626234,40,"The Postman isn't as atrocious as the inane trailers and media hype have indicated, but like ""Waterworld"" a lot of the prerelease scrutiny is well warranted."
The Postman,6,17626234,40,Costner's ponderous post-apocalyptic morality tale feels every minute of its nearly three hours.
The Postman,6,17626234,38,"There are those who will no doubt call The Postman the worst film of the year, but it's too good-hearted for that."
The Postman,6,17626234,30,"But since Costner canít save his movie, it's something of a stretch to think he might be able to save the world."
The Postman,6,17626234,30,"Goofy and gee-whiz when it isn't being post-apocalyptic glum, it is such an earnest hodgepodge that only by imagining ""Mad Max"" directed by Frank Capra can you get even an inkling of what it's like."
The Postman,6,17626234,25,The dragging pace is one of several agonizing defects in this bloated sci-fi action drama.
The Postman,6,17626234,25,"The story takes place in 2013, but you'd hardly know it from the age-old clichés Kevin Costner purloins to tell this overblown action yarn, which relies so heavily on ideas borrowed from John Ford westerns that the Hollywood giant should have been credited as codirector; too bad Costner can't invest them with Ford's kind of life and originality, though."
The Postman,6,17626234,25,What willful streak of perversity inspired Kevin Costner to take on this wacky tale of a letter carrier-turned-postapocalyptic hero?
The Postman,6,17626234,20,"Director-star Kevin Costner falls head over heels in love with himself in this nihilistic, post-apocalyptic clunker about a loner who becomes a reluctant sperm donor, role model and inevitably a godsend to what's left of America."
The Postman,6,17626234,10,"Every truly awful movie epic has a point of no return, a moment when the accumulated bad lines and bogus sentimentality become so cloying that the best defense against a mounting queasiness is an awed amusement.
The Postman, offers a new opportunity for levity every few minutes after its first hour."
Parker,6.2,17616641,75,"The movie is neatly directed by Taylor Hackford, who keeps it moving quickly without descending into a blur of cut-cut-cut edits."
Parker,6.2,17616641,75,Even the people who griped about Tom Cruise being cast as the towering Jack Reacher will have to admit Statham fits nicely in Parker's shoes.
Parker,6.2,17616641,70,"Crisp and efficient, with the occasional clunky moments, Parker also shows off Jennifer Lopez (literally) to good effect, while mostly squandering the rest of its first-rate cast."
Parker,6.2,17616641,70,"The picture is far from great, but it's a serviceable B-movie with some A-list talent on a slumming expedition."
Parker,6.2,17616641,70,"Parker...is not a great movie....But Parker is nonetheless great fun.  It is part of a welcome trend, or counter-trend, in action filmmaking, an effort to strip away the apocalyptic bloat and digital fakery that have overtaken the genre and return to its pulpy, nasty, mechanical roots."
Parker,6.2,17616641,63,"The action scenes are crisply directed, brutal, and invigorating."
Parker,6.2,17616641,63,"The tight-lipped, give-no-quarter Statham is impeccable as the pitiless yet honourable Parker (though fans of the books will no doubt quibble, especially over the British accent). On the other hand, Lopez, that pleasant sex pot, hasn't a hope of producing the tragic desperation of her down-on-her-luck character."
Parker,6.2,17616641,63,"Taylor Hackford directs crisply, unpretentiously. Patti LuPone goes Latina, playing Lopez's soap opera-addicted mom, and Bobby Cannavale is a Palm Beach cop with an eye for Leslie. The action is fast and furious."
Parker,6.2,17616641,60,"Fifty years after he first appeared, Donald E. Westlake’s antihero may have found his perfect avatar. Like Parker’s robberies, it isn’t entirely successful, but Statham and Lopez make enticingly mismatched partners in crime."
Parker,6.2,17616641,60,"He might have lost his edge, but Parker hasn’t mellowed in his old age. A sunny, silly, violent revenger that puts Statham in good company."
Parker,6.2,17616641,60,"It's an uneven but fairly enjoyable ride, one that benefits from Statham's cool, capable presence."
Parker,6.2,17616641,60,"If you're going to saturate a film with so much violence, at least it's nice to see an action hero - or antihero - actually feeling the pain."
Parker,6.2,17616641,58,"Sometimes in life, simple pleasures can be rewarding, and that’s certainly the case here. Parker is not a particularly innovative film, but it’s no less effective for the blemish."
Parker,6.2,17616641,58,"Though Parker starts off fairly strong, the action gets more predictable as it meanders toward its conclusion."
Parker,6.2,17616641,50,"Parker the movie, like the man, delivers exactly as promised."
Parker,6.2,17616641,50,"Parker is watchable chiefly for Statham, who exudes effortless cool and excels in hand-to-hand combat, as well as demonstrating his skill at wielding some very unlikely weapons."
Parker,6.2,17616641,42,"The movie is a morals-free procession of bang bang bang! and blood blood blood!, and men slamming each other with blunt objects and slicing each other with blades."
Parker,6.2,17616641,40,"If you go in knowing what you're getting, you should come out relatively satisfied. Our hero vigorously beats up a parade of bad guys. Lots of bullets fly. There are a couple of decently plotted thefts. And to tell the truth, Statham's Southern accent is nearly worth the price of admission itself."
Parker,6.2,17616641,38,"The best things about Parker are the two lead actors. Although working with material that is lackluster even by his standards, Statham manages to demonstrate a commanding screen presence that cannot be dismissed. Opposite him, Lopez delivers one of her more convincing performances."
Parker,6.2,17616641,38,"Despite an epic fight or two, Parker robs us of the revenge, the suspense of the hunt, of Parker's methodical way of tracking down those who betrayed him, one by one."
Parker,6.2,17616641,38,"The best things about Parker are the two lead actors. Although working with material that is lackluster even by his standards, Statham manages to demonstrate a commanding screen presence that cannot be dismissed."
Parker,6.2,17616641,38,"Tonally, Parker's not so much broad or inclusive as weirdly schizophrenic, vacillating between flat comedy and spiked savagery, the product of a painfully slapdash script that also includes such laughable incidental dialogue as ""pizza-I love that sh.t"" and ""beers and jewels, baby."""
Parker,6.2,17616641,30,"The essence of this grindingly violent movie can be summed up by what Parker says of his handgun to a terrified clerk at a check-cashing service: ""It's small, but it hurts."""
Parker,6.2,17616641,25,The best we get here are modest action diversions.
Parker,6.2,17616641,25,"For an old-fashioned crime thriller, you need real pros. Mr. Statham is to acting what Taco Bell is to nutrition."
Parker,6.2,17616641,25,This Parker spits in our collective eye. Don't blame us for spitting back.
Parker,6.2,17616641,25,"This newest film is an undercooked potboiler, one so tastelessly bland and visually indistinguishable that you wonder if anyone associated with the project realized what makes cheapo crime fiction so fun to consume."
Parker,6.2,17616641,20,"I have never doodled during a movie before in my life, but holy hell, Parker's two-hour running time takes a lifetime. Plenty of time for mental doodling, too."
Parker,6.2,17616641,20,"The smidgen of dramatic color offered by Jennifer Lopez, as a divorced real-estate broker drawn into Parker's payback scheme, is offset by her character's shocking naïveté, shedding her clothes on command (as if she still couldn't hide a wire somewhere) and falling unconvincingly for Statham's featureless cipher."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,75,To like that kind of story is to like this kind of movie.
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,67,"I loved this movie. Or perhaps I should say the 15-year-old boy in me -- the dreamy, disaffected misfit with his head in the stars and a stack of Bantam sci-fi paperbacks as his sole defense against small-town boredom -- loved it."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,60,"A fun movie. Not scary-fun.  If you're a male over 10 years old, that should be enough."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,50,"Fails to generate the elementary visceral thrills we've come to expect from science-fiction thrillers, let alone a compelling human drama."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,50,"When it comes to special effects, the filmmakers have spared no expense. But when it comes to the story, audiences have been shortchanged."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,50,Watch out for space junk.
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,50,"It does boast loads of cool gadgetry and some impressive special effects. It's not much, but at least the movie always gives you something to look at."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,50,"It stars the striking Moss, that fierce beauty from ""The Matrix,"" as the sternest, sexiest babe in space since Sigourney Weaver's Lieutenant Ripley."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,50,Good-looking and empty.
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,50,"The slogan for Red Planet could be ""In space no one can hear you yawn."""
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,50,"Watching the movie, it's hard to imagine why anyone would dream of going back there."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,40,"Visit Red Planet, and you'll boldly go where everyone has gone before."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,40,"Overblown, ridiculously contrived drive-in flick."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,40,"Moss -- in her first big role since ""The Matrix"" -- is the main reason to see Red Planet, a badly written and visually scenic space opus."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,40,Dull-witted.
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,40,"Isn't particularly offensive, except in its total mediocrity."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,38,"The characters aren't convincingly written, rarely if ever behave like believable humans, and consequently don't matter to us in the least."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,38,You can always judge a sci-fi thriller by its aliens. What does Planet offer --  Space roaches.
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,38,"Isn't as bad as the year's first abysmal Martian movie, ""Mission to Mars,"" but it's pretty close."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,30,"A leaden, skimpily plotted space-age Outward Bound adventure with vague allegorical aspirations that remain entirely unrealized."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,30,"A pale, patchy amalgam of the year's two unfairly reviled interplanetary adventures, ""Supernova"" and ""Mission to Mars,"" the lunkheaded Red Planet distinguishes itself with a touching pretense of scientific veracity."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,30,"I don't know the actual budget of this adventure yarn, but it feels like a middle-range effort whose heart is with the bargain-basement offerings of yesteryear."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,25,"The question in Red Planet isn't whether there's any life on Mars, but whether there's any life in the film. The answer is no."
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,25,Crash-lands as disastrously as the heroes and never quite recovers its wits.
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,20,Pfarrer's screenplay feels older than the Martian hills.
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,20,As dull and arid as a hike through the desert.
Red Planet,5.7,17480890,0,There still is no life on Mars. Red Planet is airless.
Outland,6.6,17374595,80,This gritty sci-fi is undeservedly neglected and underrated.
Outland,6.6,17374595,70,"While there are several mile-wide plot holes and one key under-developed main character, the film emerges as a tight, intriguing old-fashioned drama that gives audiences a hero worth rooting for."
Outland,6.6,17374595,70,"Outland is what most people mean when they talk about good escapist entertainment. It won't enlarge one's perceptions of life by a single millimeter, but neither does it make one feel like an idiot for enjoying it so much."
Outland,6.6,17374595,50,"Connery and Boyle are fine, but the wholesale lifting of High Noon's plot (there's even an on-screen digital readout periodically displayed, counting down the minutes until the big confrontation) certainly undermines interest."
Outland,6.6,17374595,50,"Because both dialogue and direction are none too exciting, one's tired eyes wander endlessly over the space base sets, where there has been an overuse of that potent sci-fi movie convention which conveys 'realism' by showing that life on the outer limits will be as dingy and badly lit as a suburban subway, with all the usual vices."
Outland,6.6,17374595,50,The failure of director-writer Peter Hyams to put any weight whatever behind the moral issues (crude as they are) makes this merely violent nonsense.
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,63,Everyone knows how the battles will turn out. It's what's between them that raises Masters Of The Universe ever so slightly above the mediocre.
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,63,"If you liked the toy, you'll love the movie."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,50,"There are some decent special effects, but overall it's about what you'd expect from a movie inspired by a line of toys."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,50,"A misfiring, underdone epic that takes its inspiration not from life or literature, but from a toy line and the cartoon series it inspired."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,40,"Little kids at play have come up with craftier plots, better characterization and conceivably more spectacular effects -- provided their mothers let them play with matches."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,30,"The first film to be based on a line of toys, this might not be the last, but it'd take something awful to replace it as the worst."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,20,"I'm not going to lie to you here, this movie is a steaming pile of you-know-what. The acting is horrendous, the story is the most cookie-cutter clone of every movie after Star Wars as you can get, and the effects are downright laughable. Even an easy effect such as a laser blast looks bad here."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,20,"All elements are of epic proportions in this Conan-Star Wars hybrid ripoff, based on the best-selling line of children’s toys. Epitome of Good takes on Epitome of Evil for nothing less than the future of the Universe, and the result is a colossal bore."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,90,A cunning and hilarious update of the giant-insect movies of the 1950s.
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,80,"This is postmodern folk art, a tricky transaction in which the work isn't just a story, it's a genre survey, a homage, a meditation, a parody and, oh yeah, while it's at it, still a pretty good story."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,75,"Has laughs, thrills, wit and scary monsters, and is one of those goofy movies like ""Critters"" that kids itself and gets away with it."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,75,"The cheesier it got, the more I liked it."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,75,"Eight Legged Freaks is a B-movie-and-proud-of-it thrill ride, probably the best of its kind since ""Tremors."" It does just what a good creature feature is supposed to do: It entertains with laughs, gasps, gooey spectacle and a bemused sense of fun."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,75,"The movie's combination of unabashedly fun carnage, cool special effects, and tongue-in-cheek dialogue keeps the ball rolling (albeit at reduced speed), until the last of the titular terrors has bit the dust."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,75,"Doesn't try to be anything it's not. It's happy being a funny, shoot-'em-up, run-for-your-life, green-guts monster movie. And as green-guts monster movies go, it's a beaut."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,75,"Has a smart mix of things going for it, including a self-effacing sense of humor."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,70,It's the filmmakers' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time B movies good-bad that makes Eight Legged Freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion.
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,70,So why does Eight Legged Freaks make one laugh out loud even though there is nothing revolutionary about its approach to the giant bug genre? -- the movie is so unapologetic in its crassness that it disarms even the fussiest connoisseur of throwaway disaster flicks.
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,70,"Indeed, for all its jokiness, this isn't the film for anyone who suffers from even the mildest fear of ugly, scuttling, jumping creatures with spindly, furry legs that have a habit of hiding in your shoes."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,63,Starts like a house afire and then suffers an imagination burnout.
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,63,"If you go to Eight Legged Freaks expecting anything but a campy, cheesy romp, then you have wandered into the wrong theater. This movie is for those who like smart (often self-referential) humor and cheap thrills."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,63,"Even at its most enjoyable, Eight Legged Freaks is disappointing -- it grazes your funny bone instead of tickling it like crazy."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,63,"This update of 1950s drive-in sci-fiers finds the right balance between icky, funny and scary, with sheer energy compensating for a script that could have used more parodic panache."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,60,"Silly, good-natured and thoroughly unpretentious, this giant-spider movie has nothing more on its mind than providing the kind of brainless thrills once delivered by movies like Tarantula (1955), Earth vs. the Spider (1958) and The Giant Spider Invasion (1975)."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,60,The people behind Eight Legged Freaks were absolutely correct not to make it too loopy or too dark. But they ought to have made it too something. Real fun is never this tame.
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,58,An occasionally charming mix of campy fun and dodgy computer-generated effects.
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,50,"So if you're in the mood for a scary flick, the kind where people can't resist going into the huge hole in the wall where the family Pekinese just disappeared to the sounds of being masticated, this is the one."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,50,This movie stunk so much you’d think that there were barking spiders in the theater.
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,50,"Like many of the worst pop-referential parodies of the post-''Scream'' era, this one stalls on laughs once the big joke has been established."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,50,"Neither particularly funny nor especially scary. But it's so cheerfully silly, you may just have fun with it anyway."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,50,Isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price.
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,50,"Winds up a lot closer to the movies it's taking off from than it cares to admit: cheap, unimaginative and predictable. It's the horror movie equivalent of one of those ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches that drags on interminably, though nobody in it seems to have any idea of just what the joke is."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,50,"Awkward, obvious and sporadically -- very sporadically -- amusing."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,50,"The few isolated funny moments, particularly a witty visual gag involving a pop-up tent with legs, provide only a short break from the screen-flooding onslaught of CGI creatures and screaming extras."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,40,"Amid numerous identical skirmishes with leapfrogging arachnids, trace elements of black comedy and intentional camp are discernible but utterly extraneous."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,40,"The actual movie is the cinematic equivalent of cheap Chinese egg rolls: all flour and cabbage shreds, maybe half a nibble of pork."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,30,"Limps along, spinning not a silken web but an extremely derivative, tattered one not likely to snare anybody's interest."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,30,"Action freaks may enjoy the chasing and chomping, but there's no hint of human interest or moviemaking imagination."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,100,"In the hierarchy of great movie chase sequences, the recent landmarks include the chases under the Brooklyn elevated tracks in ""The French Connection"" down the hills of San Francisco in ""Bullitt"" and through the Paris Metro in ""Diva."" Those chases were not only thrilling in their own right, but they also reflected the essence of the cities where they took place. Now comes William Friedkin, director of ""The French Connection,"" with a new movie that contains another chase that belongs on that short list."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,100,"To Live and Die in L.A. exhibits a remarkable degree of kineticism, evident in several memorable chase sequences, the film’s headlong momentum abetted by Wang Chung’s dynamic score."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,100,"A near-masterpiece. The fashions and music and attitudes on display might have been interpreted at the time as opportunistic stabs at au courant stylization, but the film is nevertheless overpowering and otherworldly rather than quaint or kitschy. It feels like a transmission from a different planet. To Live and Die in L.A. is so of its time that you can only be captivated by it."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,100,To Live and Die in L.A. is as urgent and exhilaratingly paced as anything William Friedkin's done.
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,90,"To Live and Die in L.A. is Mr. Friedkin at his glossiest, a great-looking, riveting movie without an iota of warmth or soul. On its own terms, it's a considerable success, though it's a film that sacrifices everything in the interests of style."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,90,"Friedkin plays it as brutal and cynical as he ever did with The French Connection; and this time the car chase takes place on a six-lane freeway at the height of the rush hour, going against the traffic."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,90,To Live and Die in L.A. looks like a rich man's Miami Vice. William Friedkin's evident attempt to fashion a West Coast equivalent of his [1971] The French Connection is engrossing and diverting enough on a moment-to-moment basis but is overtooled.
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,88,"An astonishing, brilliantly edited car chase--with pursuer and pursued speeding the wrong way along the LA Freeway--is one of many pleasures in this darkly stylish crime film, director William Friedkin's best effort since ""The Exorcist."""
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,88,"For those who enjoy indulging in an exciting, moody, stylized cop drama molded from the best of templates and carved out of '80s pop art, To Live and Die in LA is a truly great way to spend an evening."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,80,"Friedkin isn't nearly in enough control of his material for the film to qualify as an artwork, yet it's one of his few films with a real emotional current."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,75,"The main problem is that the supposed good guys are all such reprehensible toads it’s impossible to care whether they get to bring down Willem Dafoe’s charismatic, polo-necked super-crook."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,70,Overheated and recklessly violent.
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,63,"By-the-numbers, generic plots no longer work and that, unfortunately, is what Seventh Son delivers. Impressive set design and visuals, excessive CGI, and a loud score from Marco Beltrami can't fully compensate for bland character development and a predictable narrative that rushes along on a linear trajectory."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,63,"Surprise! One doesn’t want to damn the movie with faint praise by saying “it’s not that bad,” but that’s kind of the most objectively accurate description of it, in all honesty."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,50,"To its credit, despite a rough start (witch burning and all that), Seventh Son does not succumb to misogyny."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,50,"Seventh Son is brisk and unpretentious, though the fact that these two qualities can be considered remarkable probably says more about the state of modern genre filmmaking than it does about the movie itself."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,50,The result is a movie that serves as little more than an excuse for Moore and Bridges to camp it up.
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,50,"It’s a thoroughly incoherent, generally inane and surprisingly entertaining tale of witches and monsters and what legendary film critic Joe Bob Briggs calls “beast fu,” all set in a sub-Tolkien, sub-“Game of Thrones” pseudo-medieval universe."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,50,"Seventh Son is not a good movie, but it’s also not a pretentious one, and I call that a fair trade."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,50,"The film is overstuffed, but it’s swift and unpretentious, barreling through a non-stop series of action setpieces without pausing too long to take a breath. The busyness doesn’t eradicate the clichés, much less enrich the film emotionally or thematically, but there’s no time to think about them when Bodrov and his screenwriters, Charles Leavitt and Steven Knight, are moving along to the next sensation. It’s transporting in that sense, and that sense alone."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,42,"Though the film sat in drydock for a year, partly so technicians could convert it to 3-D, it looks as dull as it sounds."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,42,"(Bridges) has a tendency to make mistakes, especially when it comes to science fiction and fantasy titles. He has followed up the minor disasters that were ""R.I.P.D."" and ""The Giver"" with Seventh Son."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,40,"A swollen budget, a mini-Big Lewbowski reunion, and top-notch digital effects fail to enliven proceedings in yet another ho-hum dragon chaser based on a YA novel."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,40,"This swords-and-sorcery throwback has little imagination on display, instead doubling down on computer-generated flair to pass the time."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,40,"Seventh Son is indescribably disappointing because it could have been a refreshing treat for genre fans. After spending years in development, the final product is laughably abysmal, and perhaps worst of all, utterly forgettable upon viewing."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,40,"This rambunctious swords ’n’ sorcerers fantasy flick has grubby, pseudo-medieval CGI style to burn, but precious little in the way of anything new to add to this sort of genre storytelling."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,40,"Seventh Son tells a story of dragons, witches, ghosts and ogres, but the most fantastic thing about it is the idea that someone thought this lumpy, bumpy and swollen sack of tired tropes and cluttered CGI would attract audiences."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,40,"Seventh Son is recommended only for the most far-gone of fantasy addicts, for whom it will serve as a sort of methadone. It won't exactly satisfy, but it will tide you over until the next season of ""Game of Thrones."""
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,40,"Director Sergei Bodrov’s movie is based on a kids’ book in which Tom was a 12-year-old, and the actors wisely pitch their performances to a young crowd."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,40,"If anything, the movie offers up the guilty pleasure of seeing Bridges and Moore duel it out in front of countless green screens and a few stunning Canadian backdrops – two great actors clawing at each other with magic staffs and fake fire, trying to survive in the netherworld of heroic kitsch."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,38,"If the Brothers Grimm had devoted themselves to farce rather than scary fairy tales, they might have produced something like Seventh Son, a whacko sword-and-sorcery exercise."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,38,"Moore goes into operatic mode as Mother Malkin, a nasty witch who morphs into a menacing winged dragon. The worst performance, however, belongs to Jeff Bridges as a marble-mouthed, curmudgeonly knight named Master Gregory."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,38,"The only question that’s worth considering in Seventh Son is whether this all-star B-movie is bad enough to cost Julianne Moore her “Still Alice” Oscar. And the answer to that is, “Not really.”"
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,30,"Seventh Son not only offers no new spin on its bland, by-the-numbers story, it also fails to deliver any generic pleasures; I’m not sure this movie could even keep a young child engaged."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,30,"If nothing else, it’s amusing to imagine what [Mr. Bridges] and Ms. Moore chatted about between takes and how each managed to keep from cracking up, more or less."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,30,"Given the fine past work of its many parents, there was clearly potential here, but as delivered, Seventh Son amounts to nothing short of a creative miscarriage."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,25,"Torching “witches” is the one part of the story that has some historical basis, and adds an uncomfortable edge of misogyny to this otherwise empty fantasy."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,25,"Seventh Son moves at a fairly quick pace and has a sense of humor about itself. That doesn’t mean it’s thrilling, or funny. Just that it’s a quickly forgotten pile of junk."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,25,"As is often the case in films like this, Seventh Son is at its weakest when it tries to leaven its brink-of-disaster gravity with a little nerdy humor."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,20,"Seventh Son would hardly be the first film to use ""strong female characters"" as a means of waving its misogyny under the radar, but it’s seldom carried off as depressingly as this."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,20,"Jeff Bridges's abysmally campy performance may be the worst thing about disposable sword-and-sorcery fantasy Seventh Son, but it's also the only memorable thing."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,10,"I know it's early, but Seventh Son may actually be the worst movie of the year. It will most certainly be a contender. The medieval/fantasy/action/drama/romance hits pretty close to a perfect 10 on the egregious scale."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,0,"It is a staggeringly bad film, made up of lots of faulty pieces."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,0,"Nothing in Seventh Son is compelling, interesting or noteworthy, though you can feel the strain of the filmmakers attempting to set up a potential franchise."
Hudson Hawk,5.8,17218080,70,"What director Lehmann has made is essentially a multi-million dollar cult movie with great effects, a witty script and some good performances, but although some of the eccentric (and occasionally slapstick) humour may not appeal to a mass audience, it is certainly one of the more original blockbusters coming out this summer."
Hudson Hawk,5.8,17218080,60,"It doesn't have the polish or the momentum of an Indiana Jones adventure, and isn't too engaging on the plot level, but at least the filmmakers keep it moving with lots of screwball stunts."
Hudson Hawk,5.8,17218080,50,"This one may be just excessive enough to develop a cult following. It also proved quite popular with German audiences, for reasons we've been unable to fathom."
Hudson Hawk,5.8,17218080,40,A relentlessly annoying clay duck that crash-lands in a sea of wretched excess and silliness.
Hudson Hawk,5.8,17218080,38,Everybody figured producer Joel Silver and Willis couldn't lose and guess what? They all rolled craps.
Hudson Hawk,5.8,17218080,30,"Merely airheaded where it should be lighthearted, Hudson Hawk offers a klutzy, charmless hero, and wallows dully in limp slapstick and lowest common denominator crudeness."
Hudson Hawk,5.8,17218080,25,A colossally sour and ill-conceived misfire.
Hudson Hawk,5.8,17218080,25,"This may be the only would-be blockbuster that's a sprawling, dissociated mess on purpose. It's a perverse landmark: the first postmodern Hollywood disaster."
Hudson Hawk,5.8,17218080,20,"A movie this unspeakably awful can make an audience a little crazy. You want to throw things, yell at the actors, beg them to stop. But the film drags on, digging horrible memories into the brain -- like Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello's singing."
Safe,6.5,17142080,90,Safe is both a slavish imitation of cinema gone by and a movie for our time. I found it wickedly entertaining and perversely refreshing in its total lack of contemporary piety.
Safe,6.5,17142080,80,"A rough, exhausting, exhilarating action picture with a payoff which would have delighted Sam Fuller or Howard Hawks. The Stath - an actual Olympian, remember - is on top form."
Safe,6.5,17142080,75,"There's a back story to this, and it's actually sort of witty."
Safe,6.5,17142080,75,"There are zero surprises, but it looks good, moves well through a trim running time and wields its clichés with defiant aplomb."
Safe,6.5,17142080,75,"Boaz Yakin's slick direction, marked by quick cuts, unstinting energy and a lack of sentimentality, makes the action scenes satisfying. But he's a better director than writer."
Safe,6.5,17142080,75,"The violence has the straightforward, unflinching characteristic evident in ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction,"" although Yakin's dialogue falls considerably short of Tarantino's, both in terms of substance and offbeat humor."
Safe,6.5,17142080,70,"There's nothing terribly original about Safe, but it's a suitably grimy playground for action cinema's reigning pit bull."
Safe,6.5,17142080,70,"Statham probably isn't going to be doing Shakespeare anytime soon. But everybody ought to be good at something, and when it comes to this kind of thing, Statham is very good, indeed."
Safe,6.5,17142080,70,A preposterously enjoyable - or enjoyably preposterous - action-thriller.
Safe,6.5,17142080,63,"Safe's primary contribution to the burgeoning Jason-Statham-kicks-everyone's-ass subgenre is setting three of its set pieces in crowded New York City venues (a subway car, a hotel dining room, and a Chinatown nightclub) where shootouts lead to believable mass-exodus pandemonium."
Safe,6.5,17142080,60,"With Yakin's all-action plot operating like clockwork, an on-song Statham proves anything but expendable in a genre he dominates. Predictable, sure, but equally pleasurable."
Safe,6.5,17142080,60,You can't help feeling that an initially adventurous movie has had its rough edges sanded away.
Safe,6.5,17142080,58,"The character-building is proffered in bad faith, like every scene in Safe that doesn't involve bloodshed. Statham can sell a punch, but not his own vulnerability."
Safe,6.5,17142080,58,"Safe has more action than intrigue (or logic), and it's boilerplate vicious. It may satisfy Statham's fans, but they - like he - would do well to enlarge their expectations."
Safe,6.5,17142080,55,"It has neither the Red Bull–fueled crudeness of ""Crank"" nor the Frenchified lunatic vitality of the ""Transporter"" movies; it's not even as cheaply entertaining as the generic hit-man retread ""The Mechanic."" Safe shows Statham comfortably treading water, proving all the things he no longer needs to prove."
Safe,6.5,17142080,50,"Safe bangs along respectably enough, all thrown fists and cheeky comments, but it never feels like more than a second-tier video game brought to life."
Safe,6.5,17142080,50,"Love the kid though, and Statham too – it takes a star with quality to be so rock solid in a crumbling yarn."
Safe,6.5,17142080,50,"None of this bears much or any resemblance to the real world, but the violence crunches, the editing snaps and the humorous one-liners pop at well-timed junctures."
Safe,6.5,17142080,50,"Now, if only someone would offer this actor a project worthy of the full range of his talent."
Safe,6.5,17142080,50,"Statham is still playing it safe in Safe, but vulnerability is showing through the cracks."
Safe,6.5,17142080,50,"Though Safe initially seems a little darker and more thoughtful than the British star's previous comic-book escapades in ""Death Race,"" ""The Expendables"" or the ""Transporter"" trilogy, it ultimately reverts to testosterone-heavy formula."
Safe,6.5,17142080,50,"What starts out crisp and promising gives way to a conventional shoot-'em-up in Safe, a fast-paced but extremely familiar vehicle for Jason Statham, who can only carry the material so far on his brawny shoulders."
Safe,6.5,17142080,40,"Enough already with the pointless gun battles that litter Safe like spent syringes in a shooting gallery. No matter how spastically you edit them, you'll never top John Woo's early work, or, for that matter, Sam Peckinpah's. Aim higher, even if it means fewer hits."
Safe,6.5,17142080,38,"Writer-director Boaz Yakin delivers his conflicting elements mostly as intended, and with obvious ambition. But he fails to take care of certain fundamentals - most problematically, coaxing out the emotion he's seeking from Statham and young newcomer Catherine Chan."
Safe,6.5,17142080,20,Safe arrives filled with bombast and sneers but barely any thrills.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,100,"Chow's savagely funny cinematic love letter places Hong Kong legends Yuen Wah, Leung Siu Lung and former Bond girl Yuen Qiu in well-cast pivotal parts, establishing Kung Fu Hustle not only as an endearing homage to a genre's history, but an astonishing piece of cinema in its own right."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,100,Kung Fu Hustle is something you rarely encounter in theaters: a genuinely original comedy.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,100,"With a delirious mix of the sublime and the silly, Hong Kong comedy king Stephen Chow Sing-chi has taken the kung fu comedy genre to new heights of chop-socky hilarity."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,100,"The movie refers glancingly to dozens of Hollywood classics, from ""West Side Story"" to ""City Lights,"" but at heart it is a debt of honor richly paid by Stephen Chow to his martial-arts forebears and to the traditions that shaped his sensibility. His gong fu is the best."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,100,"Moviemaking doesn't get much smarter, funnier, handsomer, better than this."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,100,"It's a short, sharp, shock to the cinematic system that's virtually impossible to dislike, and if you don't leave the theatre grinning your face off, then buddy, movies just aren't for you."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,91,"All of Kung Fu Hustle is like that: You don't just watch it, you ride with it, laughing all the way."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,91,"It's a visual feast that only a crack director could provide, and it's mounted within a story and setting that, played utterly straight, might still have made a good movie."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,90,"Brilliantly choreographed and shot, Kung Fu Hustle is often grisly, visually spectacular and unabashedly silly, sometimes all at once."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,88,"Gut-Bustingly funny moves are pretty rare, so hustle over to Kung Fu Hustle, actor-director Ste phen Chow's exhilaratingly hilarious and affectionate send-up of Hong Kong action flicks."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,88,"Raymond Wong, who has become Chow's favorite composer, iced this cake with music that sounds like Beethoven, Henry Mancini's jazz and all the James Bond themes run together in a blender."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,88,"Guaranteed to deliver more innovative eye candy and smarter fun-per-second than most of this summer's fare, and that one-two punch ought to knock you off your seat."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,83,"In a farce like this, where the story is merely a string of martial-arts movie cliches lined up to be parodied, that has its own rewards."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,80,"Half-amazing, half-ridiculous, thoroughly exhilarating."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,80,"Its crowd-pleasing, action-packed brand of frenetic parody promises to spread Chow's mythos even further."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,80,Chow manages to have his cake and eat it too: Kung Fu Hustle is a kung fu parody that's also a terrific kung fu movie.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,80,Defies all laws of gravity in its pursuit of thrills and laughs—and it's so disarmingly eager to please that only a stone-faced kung fu purist could object.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,80,"The inspiration appears to be equal parts ""Looney Tunes"" and Capcom video games like ""Street Fighter II."" All the energy that was missing from the recent ""Mask"" sequel is here, and then some."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,80,It won't be long before you feel the compulsion to watch again. There is too much to appreciate in one sitting.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,80,"Kung Fu Hustle pummels ""The Matrix"" trilogy into a puddle."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,"Viewers will discover that the film has something to offer nearly everyone, whether they are a novice or a black belt in kung fu cinema."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,Does the plot spin out of control? You bet. But dumb fun this smart is a gift.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,For all its excitement Kung Fu Hustle is mostly a marvel of comedic ingenuity and mile-a-minute creativity run wild. You've never seen anything like it.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,Hustle's approach to a simple good-vs.-evil plot is eccentrically exuberant.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,"Kung Fu Hustle is to ""House of Flying Daggers"" what ""Blazing Saddles"" is to ""Unforgiven."""
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,"Like a meal prepared by an extreme chef, ''Hustle"" is more than a bit of a mess. It still tastes like nothing you've ever had before."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,This is the kind of movie where you laugh occasionally and have a silly grin most of the rest of the time.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,Vivid and madcap but fails to connect on any emotional level.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,"A celebration of Hong Kong action cinema that mocks gravity, both emotional and physical."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,70,"For all its punches, kicks, whacks and thumps, the movie does not have much impact, and for all its affectionate nostalgia, it produces a strange kind of amnesia. It knocks the sense right out of your head, and its own as well."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,70,"Chow depends way too much on jokey computer graphics that make the whole thing feel like a superhero comic, instead of athleticism or charisma or good storytelling, and that Kung Fu Hustle wears itself out long before it's over."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,70,"At times, the picture evokes such stylized musicals as ""The Band Wagon""; at others, it seems to whirr every kung-fu movie ever made into the most luscious action smoothie you'll ever imbibe."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,70,"Chow's newfound patience and attentiveness to stasis, tinged with nostalgia, are promising indications of where he's taking his art as he attempts to influence the commercial cinema that's long influenced him."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,63,The upside: Chow has energy and invention to burn. The downside: He doesn't know when he blisters his audience.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,60,"A giant leap forward in Stephen Chow's ongoing assault on Jackie Chan's status as reigning balletic clown-master of martial-arts mayhem, this extravagantly nutty crime comedy is a work of some kind of genius. Not everybody's kind of genius, to be sure."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,50,Devoid of genuine inspiration or involving character development.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,50,"The overly broad martial-arts comedy Kung Fu Hustle was obviously made with skill and affection for its many cinematic sources, yet I found the tone, timing and emotional involvement off by just enough to irritate rather than enchant."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,30,"For all its stylishness, verve and moments of visual poetry, the relentlessly punishing slapstick and overall cruel tone left me cold."
The Final Countdown,6.7,16647800,70,It's a fun film that presents an interesting scenario and raises a unique possibility. What it lacks in depth and acting skills it more than makes up for as a thoroughly enjoyable popcorn film.
The Final Countdown,6.7,16647800,63,"As a documentary on the USS Nimitz, The Final Countdown is wonderful. As entertainment, however, it has the feeling of a telepic that strayed onto the big screen. The magnificent production values provided by setting the film on the world's largest nuclear-powered aircraft carrier can't transcend the predictable cleverness of a plot that will seem overly familiar to viewers raised on Twilight Zone reruns."
The Final Countdown,6.7,16647800,60,"This is the kind of movie that some kids would probably enjoy - it's filled with technology, special effects and action. But it just doesn't make any sense. And It lacks the wit to have fun with its time travel paradoxes, as last year's wonderful Time After Time did. It just plows ahead. Or behind. Or somewhere."
The Final Countdown,6.7,16647800,60,Little more than a lengthy Twilight Zone episode.
The Final Countdown,6.7,16647800,50,"An idea worthy of Harlan Ellison, but disappointingly fumbled. Taylor handles most of the aircraft carrier material like a recruiting film, and though the script manages a few deft twists and turns, and even a neat final frisson, it ultimately works more on the tease level of a TV episode than as a movie."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,75,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a slight, good-humored film that's a lot more painless than might have been expected. Ms. Swanson's funny, deadpan delivery holds the story together reasonably well, as does the state-of-the-art Val-speak that constitutes most of Buffy's dialogue."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,67,"Buffy is amusing for a time but its destiny is to die in a disappointing, long-winded conclusion. The second half feels stretched out and muddled, as if screenwriter Joss Whedon drove a stake through his script. However, in his depiction of the vapid SoCal world, Whedon knows the territory."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,60,"The movie is a mess from start to finish. But then again, this jerky, haphazard approach is part of the movie's goofy charm."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,60,"This spoof vampire flick's sole joke is that the heroine (Kristy Swanson) is a blonde, L.A. airhead rather than a beefed-up stake-toter, mentored by Donald Sutherland's deadpan Watcher."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,60,Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a fun movie; so much better than it has to be and so much better than you expect it to be. Buffy is to vampire movies what Valley Girl is to Romeo and Juliet stories: a fresh reworking of an old formula staged by up-to-the-second California teens.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,60,"The direction of Fran Rubel Kuzui (Tokyo Pop) suggests that she's more comfortable with character than action, and Joss Whedon's script has some fun with Valley talk (both genuine and ersatz) but strains to sell the story."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,60,"If you've seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer's poster, you've seen the movie. Otherwise, this pallid crossbreeding of vampire horror with Valley Girl vamping has no surprises."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,50,"Buffy isn't heinous, just disposable. As a friend tells Buffy while she eyes a fashion purchase, ""It's so five minutes ago."""
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,50,Director Fran Rubel Kuzui's frenzied mistrust of her material is almost total. Somebody should have given her a garlic necklace -- or a Miltown -- and told her to chill out.
Krull,6.1,16519460,67,"If it’s all more than a bit silly, not to mention derivative, Krull manages to cast a fantastical spell courtesy of Peter Yates’ direction."
Krull,6.1,16519460,60,"Strong on stunts and special effects but often rambling and ponderously lurching into comedy, it's not the greatest of Christmas treats, but does have enough cherishable moments between the wordy longueurs; and in Lysette Anthony's Princess Lyssa, a heroine for whom many a young Turk would walk through fire and ice."
Krull,6.1,16519460,50,"Krull is a gentle, pensive sci-fi adventure film that winds up a little too moody and melancholy for the Star Wars set, though that must be the audience at which it is aimed."
Krull,6.1,16519460,50,"Krull provides much swashbuckling cheese. But that’s precisely what gives the film a coy, relative appeal. Despite his role’s poor definition, Ken Marshall delivers Colwyn with some charisma. Krull also features engaging art direction, including The Beast’s jagged, globe-hopping fortress, and ambitious make-up effects that–if nothing else–seems a real challenge to function in."
Krull,6.1,16519460,50,"Professionalism of director Peter Yates, the large array of production and technical talents and, particularly, the mainly British actors keep things from becoming genuinely dull or laughable."
Krull,6.1,16519460,50,One of the dreariest outer space swashbucklers of all time.
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,63,"Howard the Duck manages to be two or three types of fun: as a crazy comedy, it has some good risque/sick jokes to go along with its messy slapstick and bland rock music; as a monster movie, it has an outstanding performance from Jeffrey Jones as a scientist-cum-monster and an astonishingly repulsive Dark Overlord of the Universe shows up for the exciting climax."
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,60,"There's something kitschy about Howard the Duck that makes it fun to watch.  It tried hard and provided you're not a huge stick in the mud, there's something in this movie for everyone."
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,60,"In Howard the Duck, the special effects -- and the Muppety duck jokes -- command so much attention that it's easy to overlook the movie makers' clever narrative touches. It's rather fitting, for example, that Howard is shown to be almost as much of a misfit on the duck world as he is on Earth. And there's a sometimes-touching, sometimes-hilarious Fay Wray-King Kong relationship established between Howard and a sexy, baby-faced rock singer named Beverly (Lea Thompson). The main reason the relationship is so intriguing is that Thompson always keeps you guessing about her character's true feelings for the cantankerous bird. It's hard to fault the tongue-in-bill high spirits of a movie like Howard the Duck."
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,60,"Howard the Duck' begins as a mild satire about a duck who fell to earth, but midway through, the star is upstaged by horrifying demons and dazzling light shows."
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,50,"Pic lapses into formulaic predictability with nearly an hour of frenetic chase scenes and technically perfect explosions from Industrial Light & Magic. Action comes sporadically alive in scenes with scientist Jones, who becomes possessed by the spirit of an evil Dark Warlord that entered his body during the same fateful mishap that brought Howard to Earth. There is an abundant amount of special effects wizardry that emanates mostly from Jones as he transforms into a monster, but it is not spectacularly unique enough to distinguish this film from other, more entertaining, sci-fi thrillers."
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,40,The imagination of the opening is a hint of what the movie might have been: a view of our world that made kids consider it from another angle--as well as a spoof of the superhero. But what are all the pleasant duck effects in the face of any of this numbing waste?
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,40,"When the filmmakers grow tired of fowl puns -- about an hour after the audience does -- they switch to space opera, and Howard battles a scientist (Jeffrey Jones, funny against all odds) whose body is invaded by a giant lobster-scorpion space troll."
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,30,"The film resembles one of those Saturday Night Live sketches that has one joke and keeps going, and going, and going."
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,25,"The problem was that it was supposed to be animated, but contractual obligations forced it to become a live-action movie — specifically, an unfunny, effects-driven, story-deprived live-action film about a talking duck."
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,25,"There are a couple of mildly amusing moments, but overall Howard the Duck is a monumental waste of time."
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,25,"Howard The Duck has several jokes, really, they're all just desperately unfunny."
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,25,"When the smoke clears, only one thing is certain: Howard the Duck has laid an egg."
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,25,"Huyck's direction is resolutely uninvolved—every shot of every arrhythmically paced scene cries out for instant anonymity—and only Jeffrey Jones's sardonic scenery chewing as an archetypally deranged scientist keeps things marginally watchable. Lea Thompson is completely out of her element as Howard's sexpot girlfriend (though graduated, thankfully, from the treacly virginality of SpaceCamp), and as for the guy(s) in the duck suit . . . well, he/they deserve our condolences and prayers."
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,25,"The story has no center; the duck is not likable, and the costly, overwrought, laser-filled special effects that conclude the movie are less impressive than a sparkler on a birthday cake."
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,25,"Howard the Duck, the movie, is as bad as you've heard. Actually, it's worse. But its failings as a film have overshadowed the frequently brilliant 1970s comic book that inspired it. Using only the most superficial elements of its source material while discarding most of what made the comic interesting, the film serves as a textbook example of how to turn something into nothing."
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,25,"Howard T Duck, of Marvel Comics, might well have a beef against Lucasfilm for transforming his magnetic comic strip personality into a zipperless polyester duck-suit (filled interchangeably by eight different actors, each apparently under four feet in height) in this aimless movie."
Howard the Duck,4.6,16295774,25,"Nothing about the film works. And the festering boil on this arse-end of cinematic quality is the duck suit itself: it’s about as realistic as a builder’s quote, with less than a tenth of the aesthetic charm of the same builder’s bum cleavage."
Fire Down Below,5,16228448,70,It's precisely Seagal's incongruity that has made him a great absurdist hero -- and that makes Fire Down Below a kick.
Fire Down Below,5,16228448,50,"The star hasn’t lost his gift for making sadism seem impish. After a while, however, you may notice that the film’s mayhem is accomplished almost entirely through editing."
Fire Down Below,5,16228448,50,"Typical action fare for martial arts star Steven Seagal and, in his limited oeuvre, one of the more entertaining efforts. But the genre is pedestrian, and Seagal makes no new moves here in terms of screen personality or acting skill. What fun there is lies in the villains, some nifty stunts and a bouncy musical score rife with regional sounds."
Fire Down Below,5,16228448,50,"Like most Seagal movies, the violence is poorly choreographed, the clothes are bad, and you weren't going to see it anyway, were you?"
Fire Down Below,5,16228448,50,"The supporting cast is stocked with far better actors than Seagal -- Kristofferson, Harry Dean Stanton and Stephen Lang among them -- and country music personalities ranging from Mark Collie, Levon Helm, Randy Travis and Travis Tritt to Loretta Lynn's twin daughters Patsy and Peggy, to whom Seagal's character makes some vaguely suggestive remarks."
Fire Down Below,5,16228448,50,"Seagal fans will find that their hero is still in his usual form (his form, like his expression, hasn't wavered since he debuted in Above the Law). The action scenes are adequately directed (by Felix Enriquez Alcala, a TV director making the crossover to feature films), and there's a genuinely tense truck-and-car chase that is worth about 90 seconds of moderate excitement. The rest of the film is all by-the-book stuff, but that's what's expected whenever the name ""Steven Seagal"" tops the marquee."
Fire Down Below,5,16228448,50,"These thugs, needless to say, are pulverized as effortlessly as so many Easter chicks. This is a problem I've always had with Seagal's martial arts sequences; there's seldom a nanosecond of suspense, and the fight choreography has all the sophistication of Seventies drive-in fare such as Billy Jack and Walking Tall."
Raw Deal,5.5,16209459,63,"John Irvin has a nice eye for irony and for the larger- (and funnier-) than-life trappings of the genre. He doesn't have enormous opportunities to exercise this bent, since Raw Deal is constructed like a serial bomb: It goes off roughly every 12 1/2 minutes, littering the landscape with corpses. But you can detect an adult hand at work here, which could never be said for Cobra's arrogant and inept childishness."
Raw Deal,5.5,16209459,63,"Though the language is vulgar, the macho posturing absurd and some of the plotting inscrutable, Raw Deal has a kind of seemliness to it. It delivers every punch it promises."
Raw Deal,5.5,16209459,60,"Raw Deal is not as reactionary as Cobra but it's just as violent, maybe even bloodier, with its graphic gun fights and bullet-spattered, shattered bodies blasted before our eyes. Still it's also a quality project -- the look and sound of the film are first rate."
Raw Deal,5.5,16209459,60,A sadly lightweight spar through rule-breaking cop conventions that doesn't utilise it's star's bulk to any great effect.
Raw Deal,5.5,16209459,50,"John Irvin's direction is rudimentary for an action film and adds little excitement to the proceedings. There's not much suspense, with good guys and bad guys clearly drawn, and the final shootout is all too routine."
Raw Deal,5.5,16209459,50,You want to see guys with muscles shooting machineguns at guys without muscles? These are the movies for you. You have more than muscles between your ears? Try something else.
Raw Deal,5.5,16209459,50,"Comic book crime meller suffers from an irredeemably awful script, and even director John Irvin’s engaging sense of how absurd the proceedings are can’t work an alchemist’s magic."
Raw Deal,5.5,16209459,40,"The film's biggest continuing laugh is the very idea that Arnold Schwarzenegger, with his thick accent, could infiltrate the upper echelon of the Mafia. I could see him catering a German mob dinner, but a trusted ally? Never."
D.C. Cab,5.5,16134627,70,"D.C. CAB is a musical mob scene, a raucous, crowded movie that's fun as long as it stays wildly busy, and a lot less interesting when it wastes time on plot or conversation. There's a lot of talent in the large cast, and Joel Schumacher, the director, generally keeps things bustling."
D.C. Cab,5.5,16134627,60,"D. C. Cab is not an entirely bad movie -- it has its moments -- but if it had used more actual taxi-riding incidents and more recognizable driver types, it could have been a little masterpiece."
D.C. Cab,5.5,16134627,60,"Mindless but likable comedy about a failing Washington, DC, cab company that is revitalized when the eccentric group of cabbies work together to save it. A good cast makes the most of the uninspired material."
D.C. Cab,5.5,16134627,50,The movie's inherent flaws and jumble of subplots and side characters barely make a scratch into the stereotypes and cookie-cutter story.
Death Wish II,6,16100000,30,"Charles Bronson, as the avenging vigilante Paul Kersey, is turned loose this time on the creeps of Los Angeles and the results are every bit as revolting as in the original 1974 jackpot fantasy."
Death Wish II,6,16100000,30,"The shamelessly rehashed Death Wish II finds Kersey in L.A., methodically hunting down those responsible for his daughter’s death (just as she’s recovering from her assault in the first Death Wish)."
Death Wish II,6,16100000,25,"Even more foolish, more tacky and more self righteously inhumane than the 1974 melodrama off which it has been spun by the none-too-nimble fingers of Michael Winner, who directed the original film."
Death Wish II,6,16100000,25,"What's most shocking about Death Wish II is the lack of artistry and skill in the filmmaking. The movie is underwritten and desperately underplotted, so that its witless action scenes alternate with lobotomized dialogue passages. The movie doesn't contain an ounce of life. It slinks onto the screen and squirms for a while, and is over."
Death Wish II,6,16100000,20,"The language is filthy, the film is simpleminded, and Bronson's character is as despicable as those he murders. Death Wish II wades in gore and violence, exploiting hatred, fear, and mass murder."
The Getaway,5.7,16096000,80,"Putting up with weeks - or even months - of such media-fed psychobabble is a big price to pay for a couple of hours of defiantly unwholesome entertainment. The Getaway might just be worth it, though."
The Getaway,5.7,16096000,75,The Getaway is a pretty good remake of a pretty good action thriller.
The Getaway,5.7,16096000,75,"Their appeal as a couple of gorgeous outlaws is the main reason to see this sleek, entertaining remake of Sam Peckinpah's 1972 action film."
The Getaway,5.7,16096000,70,"A perfectly respectable thriller that mostly manages to be as crisp and efficient as the crimes it depicts, this Roger Donaldson-directed Getaway compares favorably with the Sam Peckinpah original."
The Getaway,5.7,16096000,70,A little too exactly like the original but with (fewer) memorable performances.
The Getaway,5.7,16096000,70,It's a treat to see the double-barrelled menace of Woods and Madsen together at last.
The Getaway,5.7,16096000,63,"The movie is a true throwaway: By the end, it seems to have disposed of itself."
The Getaway,5.7,16096000,63,"Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger step into the roles originally played by Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw, but their attempts to inject steamy romance into the action are undermined by indifferent direction."
The Getaway,5.7,16096000,60,"This remake of the 1972 Peckinpah gem lacks the Ali McGraw/Steve McQueen heart and soul of the original, opting instead for the vacuous and thoroughly forgettable anti-chemistry of Baldwin and Basinger."
The Getaway,5.7,16096000,60,"Spouses Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger -- the latest flavors of the month to tie the knot -- slum their way through a glam-noirish extended video. Amid director Roger Donaldson's pseudo-atmospherics and the ersatz Thompson fare hacked up by screenwriters Walter Hill and Amy Holden Jones, they shoot guns, plan heists, talk tough and make love in silhouette."
The Getaway,5.7,16096000,50,"A particularly nasty and mean-spirited action picture, with the dramatic depth of an arcade game."
The Getaway,5.7,16096000,50,"An utterly pointless remake of Sam Peckinpah's hair-raising road movie. Updated and dumbed down, this anemic variation on the bloodier 1972 original is primarily an opportunity for those vast legions of Baldwin-Basinger voyeurs. You know who you are."
Dr. No,7.3,16067035,90,"The other is a scene, improvised on the set, when Bond does a double take on seeing Goya's portrait of the Duke of Wellington (recently stolen from London's National Gallery) in Dr No's palatial living room. It's the funniest moment in any Bond picture and one of cinema's great art jokes."
Dr. No,7.3,16067035,80,"The beginning of the super-successful franchise, this remains one of the most satisfying Bond films."
Dr. No,7.3,16067035,80,"First screen adventure of Ian Fleming's hardhitting, fearless, imperturbable, girl-loving Secret Service Agent 007, James Bond, is an entertaining piece of tongue-in-cheek action hokum. Sean Connery excellently puts over a cool, fearless, on-the-ball, fictional Secret Service guy. Terence Young directs with a pace which only occasionally lags."
Dr. No,7.3,16067035,80,"As memorable as anything in the series (the arteries hadn't hardened yet) are modest highlights like Bond's encounter with a tarantula, Honeychile's first appearance as a nymph from the sea, the perils of Dr No's assault course of pain."
Dr. No,7.3,16067035,80,"All of the elements of the formula are there, but in pleasing moderation."
Dr. No,7.3,16067035,75,"There are no gadgets, forcing Bond to rely on his ingenuity (in one scene, when he needs to breathe while submerged, he uses hollowed-out reeds as air tubes). The single car chase is reasonably straightforward. And, for the only time in the series, 007 is unmistakably brutalized, appearing bloody, beaten, and disheveled as a result."
Dr. No,7.3,16067035,75,"A solid, surprisingly modest spy thriller, enlivened by Sean Connery's screen charisma and occasional hints of the extravagance to come."
Dr. No,7.3,16067035,70,"This lively, amusing picture is not to be taken seriously as realistic fiction or even art, any more than the works of Mr. Fleming are to be taken as long-hair literature. It is strictly a tinseled action-thriller, spiked with a mystery of a sort. And, if you are clever, you will see it as a spoof of science-fiction and sex."
Over the Top,5.7,16057580,60,"Stallone is sincere and soulful as a father who messed up pretty bad and just wants his kid back, Mendenhall is a likable tyke, and justice is served in the end."
Over the Top,5.7,16057580,50,One of Mr. Stallone's more muddled efforts but by no means a flop on the order of F.I.S.T. or Rhinestone.
Over the Top,5.7,16057580,50,"From the ongoing search to find new arenas in which Sylvester Stallone, against overwhelming odds, triumphs through exercise of the manly virtues, comes Over the Top, a movie about arm-wrestling. What's next? Crab soccer?"
Over the Top,5.7,16057580,50,"Over the Top is pretty much like all of the other successful Stallone films, which probably means that it will be a success, too. In fact, it`s considerably better than the ragged, recycled Rocky IV, though it lacks the wild excesses that made Rambo and Cobra campily entertaining."
Over the Top,5.7,16057580,50,"With Over The Top, Stallone had clearly exploited the Rocky formula once too often and audiences rebelled against its condescending family melodrama and heavy-handed working-class trappings."
Over the Top,5.7,16057580,50,"Stallone will never disappoint his fans intentionally. He cowrote the script (if writing is the right word) with Stirling Silliphant to formula specs, but Over the Top hasn't got the muscle of his Rocky hits. It's Stallone showing his vulnerable side, a sort of Father Knows Best -- But Can't Put It Into Words."
Over the Top,5.7,16057580,50,"There isn't a scintilla of surprise to any of it, and arm wrestling as a sport isn't really much fun to watch unless it's the match in The Fly. The only diversion is keeping track of the shameless advertising plugs that dot the film, like toadstools after a rain. It's not quite reason enough to go out to a movie, however."
Over the Top,5.7,16057580,40,"Arm wrestling, truck driving, weird weight lifting, and tear jerking are the stuff of this predictable Sylvester Stallone vehicle in which he plays Lincoln Hawk, a trucker-cum-wrist twister whose son, Michael (David Mendenhall), has been kept from him by his devious, wealthy father-in-law (Robert Loggia)."
Armed and Dangerous,5.6,15945534,30,"The first 15 minutes have some funny bits, but the movie winds up sapping you. It's a kind of whoopee-cushion nightmare, as if you woke up one morning and noticed that everyone on the street was drooling on his or her tie."
Armed and Dangerous,5.6,15945534,25,"The movie is flat, often pushy, and has none of the bubbling joy of the SCTV sketches that Candy and Levy illuminated with their presence. Set pieces are tossed in every few minutes in a vain reach for laughter; but under director Lester's sloppy hand, there is very little to laugh at."
Armed and Dangerous,5.6,15945534,25,"Armed and Dangerous is an extremely violent, often mean-spirited comedy in which most of the gags depend on the absurdly excessive use of force. Jokes like these are designed to appeal to adolescent power fantasies, and while kids may love them, adults are likely to be bored by their repetitiousness and senselessness."
Armed and Dangerous,5.6,15945534,25,"If the very sight of John Candy, the outsized comedian, strikes you as a hoot, then perhaps Armed and Dangerous is for you. It is difficult to imagine who else this latest movie about a pair of bumblers could be for."
Armed and Dangerous,5.6,15945534,25,"It takes a director with a true genius for disaster to put together SCTV veterans John Candy and Eugene Levy, the fine character actors Kenneth McMillan and Robert Loggia and the delicious new comic actress Meg Ryan and come up with a movie without a single laugh in it. Indeed, who but Mark Lester could have pulled it off? Lester's idea of directing is to turn up the music and wreck a lot of cars -- this isn't a movie, it's a Volvo ad."
Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,15681020,63,"As the hero, Christopher Reeve oozes with sincerity in the world-peace scenes - he helped write the story of the film, and this may be why he overdoes it. But he's also funny when he gets back to being klutzy Clark Kent, so the movie doesn't completely drown in its own good intentions."
Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,15681020,60,"Threadbare as it's beginning to look, the Superman series hasn't lost its raison d'etre. There's life in the old boy yet."
Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,15681020,60,About as dreary as a summit conference in Belgium.
Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,15681020,38,"So, to sum it up, Superman IV: The Quest For Peace is only slightly better than being trapped in a bear hug with Jan DeBont, and several steps below having an esoteric conversation with the Ghoulies."
Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,15681020,30,"Superman IV is cinematic kryptonite. Not only could it kill the Superman series, it might also leave filmgoers feeling weak."
Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,15681020,30,"The first few films in this series are both amusing and produced with high technical values, but this fourth in the string is a poorly scripted, anemic production."
Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,15681020,25,"More sluggish than a funeral barge, cheaper than a sale at K mart, it's a nerd, it's a shame, it's Superman IV."
Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,15681020,25,"Superman IV lacks the wonder and awe of Superman, that giddy sense of boundless possibilities. Superman had gotten old and familiar and the message-movie trappings feel tacked-on and desperate."
Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,15681020,25,Predictably awful fourth installment.
Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,15681020,25,"By ordinary movie standards it's awful, but fans of cinematic dementia should have fun for about half an hour."
Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,3.7,15681020,25,"Superman IV, except for a glitzy new villain named Nuclear Man, is one of the cheesiest movies ever made. It's so grainy and grossly envisioned, it seems filmed on pulp. Superman's crystalline Arctic palace looks as if it's made of no-deposit-no-return soda bottles, and his suit of primary colors has ring around the collar."
Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,15556340,60,"It makes clearer much that was so vague in the original; it even jokes about how confusing its premise is. In short, audiences who made the first film successful enough to warrant a second will be getting a bit more for their money."
Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,15556340,50,"With its fancifully moldering sets and technical effects, Highlander 2 is little more than a barbarous arena, a Conanistic return to paganism for those among us who still laugh at violence."
Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,15556340,50,"No plot, no real story, no point really."
Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,15556340,50,"The problem is – the film plays more like a brainstorm exercise than a feature length film. There are gobs of great ideas here, but none of them connect in the way fans likely wanted."
Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,15556340,40,Audiences unfamiliar with the first film will be hard put to follow the action as it incoherently hops about in time and space.
Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,15556340,40,"The acting is terrible,with Connery, at his lowest common denominator, stealing the show. For those of you who worry that MTV video art will destroy cinema, the ineptitudes of this film vividly detail the radical difference in forms. It sucks. But it would have made a great comic book."
Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,15556340,40,Highlander 2 is beautiful. But it's largely incoherent. The film is desperately overplotted; events and years rush by and pile up like cars in an interstate wreck. It's also terribly overexplained.
Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,15556340,30,"Leaden, laden with effects, short on imagination."
Highlander II: The Quickening,4.1,15556340,25,Highlander 2: The Quickening is the most hilariously incomprehensible movie I've seen in many a long day - a movie almost awesome in its badness.

Firestarter,6,15100000,80,"A good, stylish mixture of the kind of hokey horror and science-fiction elements in which Mr. King specializes."
Firestarter,6,15100000,63,"The most astonishing thing in the movie, however, is how boring it is."
Firestarter,6,15100000,63,"Lester manages to maintain a fair level of suspense, and he is greatly helped by Scott, giving his best performance in years as the demonic CIA man sporting a sneer and a pony tail, but King's supernatural ideas need a human focus or they seem nearly idiotic. And, unlike the central figures in Carrie or The Shining, the heroine of Firestarter is just a rather wet little girl who happens to throw fireballs."
Firestarter,6,15100000,50,"Even before it begins laying waste to the reputations of cast members, Firestarter is promptly exposed as a derivative embarrassment of a conception. What could be better calculated to illustrate King's recent decline than a ""new"" thriller whose devices have been poorly cribbed and patched together from ""Carrie"" and ""The Fury""? As a matter of fact, ""Charlie's Fiery Fury"" would be a catchier bad title than Firestarter."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,75,"Toy Soldiers is a crisp, suspenseful thriller well tailored to the tastes of teen-age audiences, who will doubtless appreciate such touches as the equivalent microchips found in one student's radio-controlled airplane and the chief terrorist's detonator, which is rigged to blow up the entire school."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,70,"Toy Soldiers is a very entertaining action film that updates 1981's sleeper hit Taps. Seeing Sean Astin (son of John Astin and Patty Duke) and his pranksters turn into commandos who wipe out the nasty invaders makes for purely escapist, crowd-pleasing pleasure."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,70,"The kids' attainment of self-respect and adulthood through sabotage and risky business is achieved at considerable cost, with Petrie pulling no punches in his depiction of violence. The exciting action set pieces, likewise, are staged with a verve and skill above and beyond the call of duty."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,70,"Toy Soldiers is hardly deep, but it's diverting and so are most of the actors. First-time director Daniel Petrie Jr. knows his way around this roughhouse terrain -- he wrote Beverly Hills Cop, The Big Easy and Shoot to Kill -- and while he keeps things taut, he has yet to display substance rather than style."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,60,"Toy Soldiers is little more than macho posturing for young men searching for their identities. As such the image of a beefy Astin sporting a machine gun is not especially healthy nor is it especially imaginative. There is an attempt at balance with the younger, nerdier intelligent kids having a role in their own salvation and a representative cast including kids of all colors. For those concessions and for directorial competence, I am grateful."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,50,"It’s Dead Poets Society meets Die Hard. The movie is competent, smoothly photographed, and pretty much free of false, baby-Rambo heroics. It’s so inoffensive that you can almost overlook its central drawback — that the students don’t have much personality."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,50,"Toy Soldiers is a movie that appeals at once to adolescent self-pity and adolescent anger-a film that takes feelings of rejection and inadequacy and transforms them into a violent revenge fantasy, directed against all those distant daddies. It's hardly the first teenpic to do so, but it's certainly one of the most thorough, the most methodical and, not coincidentally, the least fun."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,50,"If your teenage sons are looking for heroes, send them to Toy Soldiers. Even if they're not, send them anyway. They'll probably enjoy watching a judge being thrown out of a helicopter. Too bad the judge didn't take the script with him. Most reasoning adults will probably reject this far-fetched clash between American preppies and Colombian terrorists."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,50,"Toy Soldiers, a film with earnest performances and professional production values, is constructed out of characters, situations and gimmicks that will be instantly recognized by the weary viewer. There is nothing new here."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,50,"Unfortunately, Petrie's idea of dramatic tension is to expose more boyish flesh as the movie progresses. And as more and
more lumpy young pectorals are flashed, more and more people and objects are exploded. All this is accompanied by a persistently obnoxious soundtrack that features patriotic fanfares. And as the four different plots bump into each other like blinded laboratory animals, we begin to feel empathy if not pity for everyone involved."

See No Evil,5.1,15032800,40,"The killer in this nasty yet taut slice-and-dice 'em horror flick is a collector of eyeballs, which he removes from his screaming victims with an efficient single swooping motion of his talon-like index finger.

The Cave,5.1,15007991,70,"It's increasingly hard to work up a fright on the screen these days, but even if The Cave doesn't exactly terrify, it's fun and looks great."
The Cave,5.1,15007991,63,"Though The Cave really, really tries to be scary from as many directions as possible, it fails to hold much in reserve and never manages to build suspense."
The Cave,5.1,15007991,60,"Despite the striking underwater photography and production values, much of this feels like Alien: Stalagmite Edition. But if it isn't original, The Cave does demonstrate that you can always elevate threadbare material by keeping your ambitions modest."
The Cave,5.1,15007991,60,"Spare and single-minded, The Cave is an insistently entertaining piece of pulp."
The Cave,5.1,15007991,50,"It's not original, but unlike some of this summer's movies (such as The Island and Stealth), The Cave knows its place. Its job is to deliver a few jolty thrills and a couple of laughs and wrap things up before it starts to get too dumb."
The Cave,5.1,15007991,42,"Sci-fi horror aficionados, however, might want to look elsewhere for their scares, as they're unlikely to find any here. Fright-wise, The Cave is a dry hole."

The Cave,5.1,15007991,40,"Refreshing strokes of science-fact in the early sections give way to action strictly from the Ridley Scott-James Cameron playbook, but without a powerful helmer behind the camera or a memorable cast in front."
The Cave,5.1,15007991,40,It's an undistinguished effort in which none of the actors distinguish themselves.
The Cave,5.1,15007991,40,"Involves a team of divers exploring a vast cave system, an appropriate setting given the hollowness of the story and acting."
The Cave,5.1,15007991,38,"The writers supply character traits that seem to point toward a pay-off but never reach one. People all end up as tight-lipped, indistinguishable automatons who plummet 50 feet down jagged rocks with scarcely a scratch."
The Cave,5.1,15007991,38,"The screenplay is thin, the dialogue lacks nuance and the acting is often laughable."
The Cave,5.1,15007991,38,"The Cave looks pretty cool - if you're into stalagmites, stalactites and that sort of thing -and the action is nonstop once they're in the hole. Unfortunately, there are no reference points in the dark to let us know where everyone is in relation to each other and to the monsters, and, therefore, there's little suspense."
The Cave,5.1,15007991,38,Have you ever noticed how it's always the worst horror movies that go really far out of their way to lay the groundwork for a sequel?
The Cave,5.1,15007991,30,"A bottomless pit of lame characters, horror-film cliches and improbable monsters."
The Cave,5.1,15007991,30,"There's no reason to see this film in a theater -- you'll hate yourself for paying full price. Plus, you'll need beer, and lots of it, to appreciate the movie properly."

Nighthawks,6.4,14905359,80,"We've seen movies like Nighthawks before, but we haven't seen one in a while. That may be why this police film, with an international cast and a plot about international terrorism, has so much punch. All of it is standard stuff, and yet Nighthawks has been assembled with enough pep to make it feel fresh. It is particularly helped by the performances of Rutger Hauer, a Dutch actor who makes a startling impression as a cold-blooded fiend, and Sylvester Stallone, from whom less is definitely more."
Nighthawks,6.4,14905359,75,"This very effective thriller features a chilling performance by Hauer as the emotionless killing machine. Stallone and Williams are also credible, and the film makes good use of its New York locations."
Nighthawks,6.4,14905359,75,Nighthawks is an exciting cops and killers yarn with Sylvester Stallone to root for and cold-blooded Rutger Hauer to hate.
Nighthawks,6.4,14905359,70,"The plot of Nighthawks makes no sense. Its thrills are strictly visual. Stallone (the cop) gives a restrained performance for once, and Rutger Hauer (the terrorist) shows why he was to make it big in Hollywood."
Nighthawks,6.4,14905359,50,"Unfortunately, screenwriter David Shaber hasn't laid the sort of tracks that can support a clever or gripping vehicle. The rickety foundation might be finessed by swift, dynamic direction -- the sort of approach William Friedkin brought to The French Connection or Walter Hill to The Warriors, an urban thriller Shaber also helped fabricate -- but newcomer Bruce Malmuth isn't agile enough."
Kickboxer,6.4,14697005,63,"Nobody goes to these movies for their comic-book plots, klutzy dialog, or hammy acting--all of which Kickboxer has in abundance. They go for action, and on that level Kickboxer delivers the goods."
Kickboxer,6.4,14697005,50,"This may not be the dumbest action picture of the year, but it's not for lack of trying. Insurmountable plot implausibilities, rampant racial stereotyping, superfluous nudity and inhuman amounts of comically exaggerated violence--""Kickboxer"" has it all."
Winning,6.1,14644335,90,Probably the best-rounded and most appealing personalized film of this kind ever made.
Winning,6.1,14644335,75,The footage in the Indy race is of the awesome 17-car crackup that began the 1968 festivities. Its insertion lends the picture even greater authenticity.
Winning,6.1,14644335,63,Well of course he wins the race and gets the girl. You know that to begin with when you go to a movie named Winning that stars Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward and is about the Indy 500.
Winning,6.1,14644335,60,"Overly-long, it nevertheless carries sock appeal in suspenseful racing sequences and its principals in a realistically-developed marital romance score strongly."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,50,The umpteenth recycled shocker about a mystical dark child with an aura of disaster.
Godsend,4.8,14379751,50,"Unravels in a series of spooky dream sequences, dopey detective work, and a couple of richly hambone-ian De Niro soliloquies."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,50,"The best that can be said about the film is that its naturalistic look and dark hues are occasionally intriguing, and its twist is fairly unpredictable, if far-fetched."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,50,"It's a thriller, a bad thriller, completely lacking in psychological or emotional truth."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,50,"Godsend is two-thirds of a good movie, with a final third that's just downright awful. So much wasted potential only makes the whole thing that much more painful."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,50,"Downright scary in some places, Godsend might be more potent if it wasn't watered down by religious trope predictability."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,42,"To its credit, the film has an engagingly bleak and minimalist look, and a brisk pace. But the chills are few. Every step seems contrived, predictable or unintentionally funny."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,40,"Solid performances, handsome production values and a few genuinely creepy scenes are not enough to save Godsend."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,40,"When is a horror movie not a horror movie? When its a strained, by-the-numbers production that limps to an unlikely conclusion like Godsend."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,38,Godsend is godawful.
Godsend,4.8,14379751,38,"De Niro wears a shamefaced look most of the time, as if doubly embarrassed: He agreed to a movie he knew was worthless, yet he's too lazy or indifferent to give us his best."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,38,"With its cheap scares, its defiant lack of special effects, and the most blatant usage of a red coat as a stand-out prop since Schindlers List, Godsend is as much an experiment-gone-wrong as its Frankensteinesque plot."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,30,"Kinnear and Romijn-Stamos appear to be vying for the title of filmdom's least-convincing married couple, while Robert De Niro, as the movie's modern-day Dr. Frankenstein, takes his own expert career slumming to a new depth -- he's become an evil clone of a once-great actor."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,30,"A consistently underused and often underrated actor, Kinnear gives one of those sympathetic performances that prevent you from believing the worst about a movie despite the sounding alarms."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,30,This thin concoction of domestic drama and thriller suspense won't hold up after the curiosity factor runs its brief course. Neither Robert De Niro nor a phalanx of a dozen producers can deliver Godsend from unintentional comedy.
Godsend,4.8,14379751,30,"Despite its provocative premise, this throwback to deliberately paced, low-tech chillers of the pre-CGI era is a dreary slog through haunted-child movie cliches -- portentous dreams, glassy-eyed stares, cryptic pronouncements."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,30,"As the film's boo! moments get spookier and more frequent, Godsend gets more and more inane."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,30,"The picture, which fails to achieve its ambitions or to fulfill our expectations, is ultimately worse than a violent piece of hack work, in which the director isn't interested in displaying his integrity -- or taste. You'd be better off downloading the trailer: a much more convincing piece of storytelling."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,30,"As in most bad thrillers, the number of pointless shocks increases in direct proportion to the drama's decreasing vitality, like defibrilator paddles jolting a dying man."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,25,How could such a high-octane cast produce such low-octane horror?
Godsend,4.8,14379751,25,"An unsatisfying, overly restrained bore, capped off by an ending so strange and inconclusive, it feels like something you'd find on the ''deleted scenes'' portion of a DVD."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,25,Every scare is telegraphed. Every surprise is recycled from a better thriller. Even the devil would send this one back.
Godsend,4.8,14379751,25,"At the half-hour mark, Godsend falls off the edge of reason, veering wildly away from what seems the promising beginning of a drama about the ethics of human cloning and instead becomes the cheesiest of hallucinatory horror movies."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,25,"There's no excuse for a thriller as lame, leaden and unthrilling as Godsend, which manages to take a potentially interesting subject - human cloning - and use it to put audiences to sleep."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,25,"In Godsend, we have the spectacle of three good actors tied to the mast of a sinking premise."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,20,"Neither very scary nor very interesting, Godsend is an unresurrectable muddle."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,20,"The pivotal plot twist isn't hard to predict, and Brit theater vet Hamm and screenwriter Mark Bomback rely on jolts that date back to the silent era."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,20,It mostly serves as a warning to stay away from future films involving director Nick Hamm and screenwriter Mark Bomback.
Godsend,4.8,14379751,20,"Godsend is based on an intriguing premise. Sadly, it's mangled into an Omen-lite disaster area, thanks to a script torn between making a moral point about cloning and cheap shocks."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,12,"Godsend makes swill of religion, science, family, and morality. It has the sensitivity of a cactus, the ingenuity of a square wheel, and the integrity of a CEO."
Godsend,4.8,14379751,10,Not just a bad thriller but also a thing of pain.
Godsend,4.8,14379751,10,"Turns into a pea-brained hodgepodge of ""The Omen"" (1976), ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999), and about 30 Grade-Z Bela Lugosi mad-scientist movies."
Ishtar,4.3,14375181,80,"The most underestimated commercial movie of 1987 may not be quite as good as Elaine May's three previous features, but it's still a very funny work by one of this country's greatest comic talents."
Ishtar,4.3,14375181,80,"Enter Charles Grodin, who upstages all involved via his savagely comical portrayal of a CIA agent."
Ishtar,4.3,14375181,75,"Ishtar is an unabashed vamp for a pair of household names, and as such it works, often hilariously."
Ishtar,4.3,14375181,70,"Is it worth seeing? Yes. The ability to charm in the modern world is rare, and Ishtar does charm. Essentially, it's a teen film for adults, which is to say, it's mindless but not stupid good fun. And there are at least four times when the audience laughs out loud."
Ishtar,4.3,14375181,70,"For all the bad press Ishtar received, it does have a certain odd charm... The biggest problem is that any attempted subtlety is swamped by May's bid to turn the film into an epic adventure story."
Ishtar,4.3,14375181,70,"The guys in Ishtar are the boring wallflowers of the world. They probably shouldn't be mocked, disgraced and beaten, but who really wants to spend close to two hours with them."
Ishtar,4.3,14375181,63,It's piddling -- a hangdog little comedy with not enough laughs...its spirit rattles around inside it like a marble in an oil drum.
Ishtar,4.3,14375181,50,"A truly dreadful film, a lifeless, massive, lumbering exercise in failed comedy. Elaine May, the director, has mounted a multimillion-dollar expedition in search of a plot so thin that it hardly could support a five-minute TV sketch."
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,90,An unknown treasure of a fantasy film and well worth a look for fans of the genre.
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,80,"In many ways, Dragonslayer is a realistic fairy tale. All of the classic pieces are here: heroes, bad guys, monsters, virgins in peril, mysticism and staggering odds."
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,80,"The film excels as a visual exercise, as a study in adolescent psychology, and even as astute political analysis (it's the dragon who holds the fiefdom together)."
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,80,"The scenes involving the dragon are first-rate. The beast is one of the meanest, ugliest, most reprehensible creatures I've ever seen in a film, and when it breathes flames it looks like it's really breathing flames."
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,75,The giant computerized dragon alone is worth viewing. But Dragonslayer profits from spirited direction and camera work plus the expert Richardson at its nucleus.
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,75,"Dragonslayer has pacing problems, and its special effects tend to be more overpowering than helpful. But it also has a sweetness and conviction that amount to a kind of magic."
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,70,This movie has two big things going for it—the dragon and the man who masterminds its slaying.
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,70,"Verges on the nasty for the nippers; sails close to déjà vu for fantasy fans; fated, probably, to damnation by faint praise."
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,63,"A well intentioned fantasy with some wonderful special effects, Dragonslayer falls somewhat short on continuously intriguing adventure."
The Beastmaster,6.2,14056528,38,Not much action or excitement here.
The Beastmaster,6.2,14056528,30,"It's meant as a tiny bit of praise to say that the movie, which was made in southern California, looks as if it had been shot in Spain or Yugoslavia. It looks both big and cheap."
The Beastmaster,6.2,14056528,20,"When The Beastmaster begins, it is very hard to tell what it is all about. An hour later, it is very hard to care what it is all about. Another hour later, it is very hard to remember what it was all about."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,70,"Mixing horror and comedy while minimizing the gore, writer-director Paul Weitz (About a Boy) serves up a witty adventure fantasy with a tasty dollop of schadenfreude."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,67,It's more fun than a poke in the heart with a sharp stick.
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,63,"Reilly is very funny as the sarcastic mentor, and director Paul Weitz strikes a loopy tone in the scenes at the freak encampment."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,63,It's creepy but tinged with sarcasm and infused with silly fun.
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,63,"Trades breathless romance for a fun ""Ripley's Believe it or Not""-flavored weirdness."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,60,"While ""Twilight"" will make more money and get more attention, the darkly comic Cirque du Freak boasts the shaggy charm of the natural underdog."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,50,The finished film has been tinkered with and tweaked so thoroughly that it borders on the incomprehensible.
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,50,A profoundly unsatisfying experience - and that doesn't consider the derivative nature of the plot and a lackluster performance by the lead actor.
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,50,"Reilly gives it his all, and he’s both very enjoyable and about as scary as a stubbed toe."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,50,The film is competent without being spectacular or thrilling.
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,50,"This movie incites curiosity tinged with confusion and irritation. It bristles with interesting ideas — about friendship and freakishness, honesty and anger — and intriguing characters, all of which may blossom in later episodes."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,50,"Cirque is a harmless bit of fluff with a very cool look, but there's just never enough bite."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,50,"Has its moments of fun, many of them having to do with Reilly's deadpan comic style. But the movie lacks the original edge of its better predecessors."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,50,"More than anything, the film lacks a rapport with its audience."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,50,"Actually, by way of a sequel, the filmmakers could just set Cerveris, Dafoe, and Reilly up for a purr-off. That’d be more fun than most of this film."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,40,The Vampire's Assistant is too busy making impossible claims about just how spectacular its sequels will be to serve up a self-contained story with a satisfying finale.
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,40,"Directed by Paul Weitz (American Pie), the movie suffers from the same tonal schizophrenia of that other recent goth wannabe, ""Jennifer's Body"": Is it meant to be scary or funny? Oops, it's neither."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,40,"Vampirism is the new monstrosity du jour, and with Cirque du Freak: The Vampire’s Assistant, tweener boys get their own testosterone-infused variant of Twilight."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,40,Making a vampire movie without any bite is like removing guns from a Western.
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,40,"Disjointed and disorganized, and it meanders when it needs to gallop."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,38,"The movie has good special effects and suitably gruesome characters, but it's bloodless."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,38,"Jammed with story threads that don’t cohere, Cirque commits the cardinal sin for a vampire movie: It’s bloodless."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,33,"Subplots go nowhere, and characters -- many played by well-known actors -- barely get screen time. Willem Dafoe, Salma Hayek, and Jane Krakowski are among those who are there and gone."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,25,"The movie is occasionally clever, but still inferior to last year's ""Twilight"" film, mostly because the story is so muddled."
Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,5.9,14046595,12,"Calls to mind Grandpa taking out his dentures and trying to put on a comedy monster show for little kids at Halloween: When he tries to be scary, he's goofy, but when he tries to be goofy, he's scary."
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,13829734,63,"Lame, but in a good way."
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,13829734,60,"Lambert is as uncharismatic as ever, while Van Peebles is as frightening as a wrestler in mock angry mood, and just as ridiculous. To Morahan's credit, however, he smoothly continues the series' tradition of flashy images, showy sfx, aerial landscape shots and driving rock tunes."
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,13829734,50,"Although Christopher Lambert repeats his film role as the immortal action hero, he is less dynamic than he was in Highlander or even Highlander 2, The Quickening. He is also far less charismatic and interesting to watch than Adrian Paul of the European television serial. Moreover, in this film, Lambert inexplicably whispers his lines, while the special effects are deafening."
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,13829734,40,Those immortals keep noting that there can be only one. Perhaps they mean there should have been only one.
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,13829734,38,Highlander: The Final Dimension is no more compelling than the average pile of bricks.
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,13829734,25,An incoherent mess.
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,13829734,25,"An unbelievably trashy meltdown of the tartan warrior franchise, Highlander III checks in as a breakneck, roller-coaster genre ride that’s brainless fodder for undiscriminating auds."
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,13829734,25,"Highlander 3 has an edge over its prequels in that it's so shoddily directed that it's probably a great deal of fun to watch after a couple of six-packs. Actually, that's probably the only time it might be fun to watch, and I'm not going to be the guy to put that theory to the test for you."
Supergirl,4.4,13600000,80,"Director Jeannot Szwarc could have done more with the action scenes, but he has a snappy sense of pace and comic timing. Blond, blue-eyed Slater brings an engaging sweetness to Supergirl; and she plays Linda with an awkward, gawky girlishness, subtly different from her Supergirl role."
Supergirl,4.4,13600000,70,"Helen Slater is a find: blonde as Supergirl, dark-haired as Linda Lee, she’s an appealing young heroine in either guise. Screenplay is filled with witty lines and enjoyable characters, but Jeannot Szwarc’s direction is rather flat."
Supergirl,4.4,13600000,60,Most delightful of the Super-series for its good-natured disregard of narrative considerations.
Supergirl,4.4,13600000,60,"The gift of Christopher Reeve, in his best scenes and when the filmmakers allow it, is to play Superman without laughing, to take him seriously so that we can have some innocent escapist fun. Helen Slater has the same gift, but is given even less chance to exercise it in Supergirl, and the result is an unhappy, unfunny, unexciting movie."
Supergirl,4.4,13600000,50,"Supergirl arouses some initial curiosity about the differences between the two cousins; for instance, that Supergirl can't change in phone booths and is much the better flier of the two. However the film, as directed by Jeannot Szwarc and written by David Odell, quickly loses its novelty."
Supergirl,4.4,13600000,50,"Slater not only makes for a dull Supergirl, but she's stuck in a clumsy, silly film that tries for the light touch of Richard Lester's Superman II and fails decisively."
Supergirl,4.4,13600000,50,"Jeannot Szwarc's direction is flat and uninspired, emphasizing the jokey elements without any sense at all for the material."
Supergirl,4.4,13600000,40,"Queasily suspended between drag theatrics (Faye Dunaway and Brenda Vaccaro camping it up on a soundstage replica of a carnival spook house) and Spielbergian wholesomeness (Canadian Helen Slater as a toothy, Aryan Ubermadchen), this is one comic-book feature that doesn't fly."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,95,"Dredd works because it's an action flick with wide appeal that takes risks it doesn't need to - in its delightfully off-putting violence and daring style - and those choices pay off in a singular and exhilarating movie experience. It's savage, beautiful and loads of fun."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,83,"Paul Leonard-Morgan's thumping techno soundtrack is thrilling. And Urban manages to give a credibly wry performance using little more than his gravelly, imitation-Eastwood voice - and his chin."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,"This is a film that aims squarely at respecting its source’s established fan base, and cares little for casualties who can’t hang on through its grindhouse paces."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,"What's exceptional is the orchestration of color, form, light and dark (lots of dark), 3-D technology and digital effects into a look that amounts to a vision."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,Dredd is proudly degenerate - and it never feels compelled to slow down and explain itself.
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,"The impressively lean script by Alex Garland (28 Days Later) is shorn of almost all superfluity beyond a few dud Schwarzeneggeresque kiss-offs, while Anthony Dod Mantle's sensational widescreen cinematography harkens back to the tension-inducing inventiveness of early John Carpenter."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,"In a world of compromised adaptations, Dredd is something of a triumph."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,"Pitched at the right level to please original fans, but still slick and accessible enough to attract new ones, Dredd 3D feels like a smart and muscular addition to the sci-fi action genre."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,78,"Absolutely, 100% kickass. Now would someone please get busy on the ""Tank Girl"" do-over, please?"
Dredd,7.1,13414714,75,"This, finally, is the Dredd movie comic book readers have been anticipating."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,75,"The themes are also dated. There are times when Dredd 3D feels like an escapist companion piece to ""The Day After."" But there we go again, thinking too much. No sense in ruining such a fine piece of cheap entertainment."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,75,"Fitfully uneven, Dredd is nevertheless an intriguing consolidation of action-movie excess -- and even makes a solid case for its aesthetic appreciation."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,75,The story places a premium on delivering its disreputable sex-and-violence goods with a minimum of fuss or pretension.
Dredd,7.1,13414714,75,"If there's a serious disappointment, it's the villain. Ma-Ma, despite being played with over-the-top zest by Lena Headey, isn't a very impressive foil for the mighty Judge Dredd, even when she calls for ""back-up."""
Dredd,7.1,13414714,70,"Dredd 3-D places you firmly in an unreal, dreamlike world and rouses you with its unexpected grace and its rhythms and its movement. The plot ceases to matter after a certain point: This is a great big beautiful music video, and there's nothing really wrong with that."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,70,"This breathless science-fiction thriller isn't just gory. It practically revels in graphic violence, with several scenes shot in excruciating slow motion."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,70,"Grim, gritty and ultra-violent, Dredd reinstates the somber brutality missing from the U.K. comicbook icon's previous screen outing."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,67,"Dredd is a video game procedural tied to great visuals, but one without deeper substance to make its experience remotely meaningful."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,63,"For sci-fi action fans, it's an instant classic. For everyone else, it's a dark, bloody mess."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,60,The stylish sci-fi film makes some eye-popping and unexpected choices that add up to one heck of a fun film.
Dredd,7.1,13414714,60,"There was much to dread about this new iteration of Dredd, but it's a solid, occasionally excellent take on the character, with Urban's chin particularly impressive."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,60,"Grungy, compact and delightfully violent, Dredd wants to hit you as hard as it can. The sequel may be the movie you really want, but for now, justice has been done."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,50,"Dredd's cinematography is one of its strongest assets speaks to the film's larger problems - the parts and pieces just don't have the total impact they should, like a punch sailing helplessly through the air rather than forcefully smacking its target."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,50,"Pretty clearly determined to deliver the antidote to Stallone's movie, the filmmakers take their cues from Christopher Nolan's Batman filmscape, dropping Dredd into a fictional concrete sprawl (actually South Africa) that's relentlessly grounded, visually and dramatically. In a generic way, the environment works."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,42,"Olivia Thirlby adds some humanity as the empath. And as the scarred queen of a drug cartel, Lena Headey chews the scenery, and some of her costars, with relish."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,40,"Every so often there's a suggestion that a police state may actually be a lousy idea, but this thought dies even faster than the disposable characters."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,38,"Calling Dredd 3D a movie is sort of a lie. It's a premise, and there are levels to reach, and always there's another grimy hallway to stalk, and then you turn right or left, and then kill some more."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,33,"Dredd, a second attempt at making Judge Dredd a movie star, overcorrects, veering in the opposite direction with a dark - literally and otherwise - nearly humorless bit of ultraviolence distinguished largely by a fondness for spurting CGI blood."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,25,All I wanted to do was escape from this aggressively ugly world and its equally unattractive characters. It's not that the movie is in bad taste or cheesy (though it is) but that all of its hyperviolence adds up to nothing: This thing is dedd.
Dredd,7.1,13414714,20,"The drug that Ma-Ma trafficks in, Slo-Mo, slows its user's brain to 1% of its normal speed. Dredd unfortunately makes you feel as if you, too, have partaken."
Jason X,4.4,13121555,80,"The film has spunk. Unfortunately, the gore comes with brutal regularity, so that, despite Farmer and Isaac's attempts to liven things up, the film still just wears you down."
Jason X,4.4,13121555,58,The premise of Jason X is silly but strangely believable.
Jason X,4.4,13121555,50,It gets much more watchable in the last half-hour.
Jason X,4.4,13121555,50,"Feels like it was written as a fairly straight horror/sci-fi movie, then script-doctored by a comedy writer intent on satirizing the original script. As a result, the film's intentional and unintentional laughs mingle so freely that it becomes difficult to differentiate between the two."
Jason X,4.4,13121555,40,"Jason X conjures up more giggles than scares, assuming you make it through the first 15 minutes."
Jason X,4.4,13121555,40,A moviegoer's only defense against Jason is to avoid theaters showing this gruesome and derivative movie.
Jason X,4.4,13121555,38,"There's a hint of nostalgia toward the end, with Jason encountering two nubile female campers in a virtual reality Camp Crystal Lake -- but it merely serves as a reminder that the franchise should have quit while it was ahead."
Jason X,4.4,13121555,38,"This time the action takes us out of the usual campgrounds and girls in underwear into the realm of outer space, where no one can hear you screaming ""Enough already."""
Jason X,4.4,13121555,38,Further proof that titular antagonist Jason Voorhes is ready for retirement -- to videostore shelves.
Jason X,4.4,13121555,38,A protracted and only sporadically imaginative menu of ways to be murdered.
Jason X,4.4,13121555,38,Even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer's screenplay.
Jason X,4.4,13121555,30,"Too much of Jason X plays it straight, and that means boredom. Murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous."
Jason X,4.4,13121555,30,"Despite the futuristic setting, which relies so heavily on GGI effects that it looks like a feature-length production concept painting, this film is painfully predictable."
Jason X,4.4,13121555,30,"The kind of a moron movie, which is built to be watched by people who havent even seen the other nine."
Jason X,4.4,13121555,25,"It will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary. But here's the real damn: It isn't funny, either."
Jason X,4.4,13121555,20,"The only chills to be found are courtesy of your theater's central air, and the suspense will come from the wait to see which disappointed kid in a hockey mask will be the first to slash the screen."
Jason X,4.4,13121555,20,"Jason X sucks on the levels of storytelling, character development, suspense, special effects, originality, punctuation, neatness and aptness of thought. Only its title works."
Jason X,4.4,13121555,16,"Here suspense is abandoned, and Jason is on-screen so long you get sick of seeing him -- and sick of the poorly staged slasher-film tricks."
Jason X,4.4,13121555,12,"Like a dinner-theater version of the ""Alien"" movies without the good grooming."
Jason X,4.4,13121555,12,"It had a little originality, unlike the other sequels, but not much."
I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,6.6,13030057,80,"In many respects this is a black counterpart to The Naked Gun, and very nearly as funny; the bounty of antimacho gags is both unexpected and refreshing."
I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,6.6,13030057,80,"Unrelenting, unremitting, a brilliant broad-brush of a parody."
I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,6.6,13030057,75,"An extremely funny movie that presents a torrent of insightful gags at breakneck pace, I'm Gonna Git You Sucka features many of the stars of the old ""blaxploitation"" movies, adding weight and authenticity to Wayan's film. In offering up this affectionate parody of the old movies, Wayans also turns a satiric eye on black culture in general--but in an inoffensive, lighthearted manner."
I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,6.6,13030057,75,"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka is a lively but uncertain mixture of nostalgia, silliness and genuinely unpredictable humor."
I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,6.6,13030057,60,"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka is a comedy that feeds off the blaxploitation movies, and although, like all good satires, it is cheerfully willing to be offensive, it is almost completely incapable of being funny."
I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,6.6,13030057,60,"It's not that Wayans lacks wit, it's that he's stomped it to death. A sweet-natured performance -- and the fact that he and Tom Cruise probably have the same orthodontist -- doesn't quite make up for the muddle. Don't be a sucka."
I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,6.6,13030057,60,Wayans' choosing to play romantic lead seems more narcissistic than smartly comic (watch him unleash those built biceps once too often); he lacks an unidentifiable shtick. And he seems too easily satisfied with predictable and sophomoric punchlines. Lapses like that give Sucka the Shaft.
They Live,7.3,13008928,91,The terrors put forth by the film are at once specific to the era of its production and timeless in their direct connection to the American experience.
They Live,7.3,13008928,80,"They Live is, to scramble its most famous line, better at chewing bubblegum than kicking ass."
They Live,7.3,13008928,75,"A fantastically subversive film, a nifty little confection pitting us vs them, the haves vs the have-nots."
They Live,7.3,13008928,70,"Carpenter is trying for a satire of advertising and consumerism under late capitalism, and although the film is great fun at first--especially when depicting the world through Nada's glasses--it rarely rises above the intellectual level of a comic book."
They Live,7.3,13008928,70,"All in all, an entertaining (if ideologically incoherent) response to the valorization of greed in our midst, with lots of Rambo-esque violence thrown in, as well as an unusually protracted slugfest between ex-wrestler Roddy Piper and costar Keith David."
They Live,7.3,13008928,70,"The plot for They Live is full of black holes, the acting is wretched, the effects are second-rate. In fact, the whole thing is so preposterous it makes ""V"" look like ""Masterpiece Theatre."" [5 Nov 1988]"
Stroker Ace,4.8,13000000,50,"A knuckleheaded but amiable summer trifle, Stroker Ace is aimed straight at Burt Reynolds' vast heartland public."
Stroker Ace,4.8,13000000,38,"Stroker Ace is another in a series of essentially identical movies he has made with director Hal Needham, and although it's allegedly based on a novel, it's really based on their previous box-office hits like Smokey and the Bandit and The Cannonball Run."
Stroker Ace,4.8,13000000,30,"The must-miss movie of the summer. It's a witless retread of the earlier, far funnier road-movie collaborations of Mr. Needham and Mr. Reynolds."
Stroker Ace,4.8,13000000,25,"Burt Reynolds hits new lows as he mugs his way through this film as Stroker Ace, a race-car driver who's under the control of chicken-franchise owner Clyde Torkle (Ned Beatty). The script is filled with good ol' boy humor and car crackups."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,88,"The most audacious, implausible, cheerfully offensive, hyperactive action picture I've seen since, oh, ""Sin City,"" which in comparison was a chamber drama."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,88,"This is likely the fastest-moving intentionally funny action movie ever made. It's as if the 21 Bond movies and four ""Die Hards"" had been distilled to remove their body fat (that is, character development, buildup, rest stops, etc.) and left us with only the killing and the punch lines."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,83,"Its pulpy violent excess will tip over...into slightly more excessive excess. That's its silly, scuzzball joy."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,80,"Anyone looking for subtlety, character development or layered plotting will be disappointed, but action fans will find plenty to amuse them with this film that makes ""Hard-Boiled"" look restrained."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,80,Extremely violent guilty pleasure of a thriller.
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,75,"This wet dream for action junkies leaves out logic and motivation --you know, all the boring stuff."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,75,"The season's first guilty pleasure, Shoot 'Em Up is a joyously silly, R-rated, John Woo-in flected Looney Tune, with Clive Owen as a carrot-chomping, gun-toting Bugs Bunny matching wits with Elmer Fudd-ish assassin Paul Giamatti."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,75,"It's funny without being toothless, adrenaline turbocharged without being mean and utterly deranged in the best sense of the word."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,75,"For sheer audacity and adrenaline-fueled carnage, Shoot 'Em Up hits its target pretty much dead on."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,70,The presence of the two actors and the film's mordant sense of humor buoy the downtime between bloodbaths and genre fans may find enough to love here.
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,67,"It's all meant as gory good fun, but once the novelty wears off half an hour in, the rest of the film is only meant for people who absolutely agree with Giamatti's character about that violence thing."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,63,"There's a little bit of ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" in Shoot 'Em Up, although this production isn't as smart or as slick."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,63,"Absolutely not for feminists, lovers of period films, and anyone whose sensibilities are bruised by over-the-top stuntwork, it's a cocktail made up of three parts testosterone to one part brains."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,60,Intermittently amusing.
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,58,"The saving grace in an exuberantly graceless movie is Clive Owen. This actor is bulletproof. Even in a sick-joke jamboree like Shoot 'Em Up, he mows down the competition and gets his laughs without losing his composure."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,50,The whole thing feels like watching somebody else play a video game. Director Michael Davis obviously was more interested in crafting a series of gunfights than a coherent story arc.
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,50,Violent thrills and massive blood spills are the essence of the absurdly over-the-top action flick that is Shoot 'Em Up.
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,50,One can certainly be amused and entertained by writer-director Michael Davis's hyperbolic action frolics--I was--but not without feeling pretty low and stupid.
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,50,"A furious 90-minute trailer of a movie that exceeds the speed limit for action films established by Quentin Tarantino's recent ""Grindhouse."""
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,50,"As a bonus, it contains, at least, the best death-by-carrot scene in the history of film."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,50,"Despite all the flying bullets, which are admittedly entertaining at times, Shoot 'Em Up doesn't offer enough bang for your bucks."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,40,"Good taste is the first fatality in this gonzo thrill-seeker, sure to offend mainstream dispositions, yet too stylistically audacious to dismiss outright."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,30,"For the most part, this is strictly kiss kiss, bang bang, yawn yawn."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,25,"It sets a tone, all right. A lot of gamers (sorry, ""filmgoers"") may well enjoy writer-director Michael Davis' ultraviolent lark. It's not meant to be taken seriously. But films like this are worth taking seriously because they're genuinely cruddy and hollow and, yes, vile."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,25,Shoot 'Em Up is not only the title of Hollywood's latest descent into nonsensical mayhem but pretty much sums up the entire inane plot as well.
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,20,"It's just gunfights strung together, without a whisper of coherence or meaning. The fights are staged so that they all look the same, and the principle is always the same: The gunman's multiple antagonists never hit, and he never misses. John Woo at least had fun with this sort of thing 20 years ago. And Giamatti? What the heck is he doing here?"
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,20,"The picture is just a catalog of strained camera moves and preprogrammed gags, with no wit or style."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,0,A worthless piece of garbage.
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,0,"Owen, Giamatti, and Bellucci--all fine actors at the peak of hireability--must have been coming off a collective coke bender when they agreed to be in this murky, straight-to-video-looking piece of crud."
The Omega Code,3.5,12614346,50,"Given its budget, the quality of its writing, acting and production is remarkably high--about miniseries level."
The Omega Code,3.5,12614346,20,"Bad photography, bad acting and bad dialogue."
The Omega Code,3.5,12614346,20,"By turns laughably simplistic and confoundingly muddled as it charts the ""final battle"" between good and evil."
The Omega Code,3.5,12614346,20,A hokey doomsday/millennialist thriller.
The Omega Code,3.5,12614346,20,Proof positive that heavy underground buzz doesn't necessarily imply merit or even intrinsic interest.
The Omega Code,3.5,12614346,20,"Dreadful suspense piece that has ""Mystery Science Theater"" appeal written all over it."
The Omega Code,3.5,12614346,20,Code Word: Bad!
The Omega Code,3.5,12614346,16,"Even Christians hip to TBN preachers' peculiar eschatology may be baffled by the incoherent wrap-up, which provides the stingiest Second Coming since the third ''Omen ''movie."
The Omega Code,3.5,12614346,9,This wretched jumbo helping of Christian Fundamentalist agitprop takes itself entirely too seriously to be anything but ploddingly dull.
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,100,"It is the Road Warrior (as it was subtitled for the American release) that remains the definitive Max movie, hard as nails, hell for leather, it lands like a punch to the jaw. Don't drive angry? Yeah, right."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,100,"Part post-apocalyptic Western, part midnight motorcycle flick and part Rocky Horror Picture Show, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is, when you add it all up, a nutty, B-movie masterpiece."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,90,Miller's choreography of his innumerable vehicles is so extraordinary that it makes Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark look like a kid fooling with Dinky Toys.
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,90,Miller suggests violence; he does not exploit it. He throws the viewer off-balance by mixing the ricochet rhythms of his chase scenes with tableaux of Walpurgisnacht grandeur.
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,90,"Director Miller keeps the pic moving with cyclonic force, photography by Dean Semler is first class, editing is supertight, and Brian May’s music is stirring."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,88,"The experience is frightening, sometimes disgusting, and (if the truth be told) exhilarating. This is very skillful filmmaking, and Mad Max 2 is a movie like no other."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,80,"It's a highly stylized, roaringly dynamic action film that shuns plot and characterization in favor of a crazy iconographical melange—it's like the work of a western punk trucker de Sade...The climactic chase, with its deft variation of tempo and point of view, is a minor masterpiece."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,80,"Gibson is surprisingly uncharismatic, but Miller makes up for it with whizz bang action."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,80,"In its stripped-down, cannily cinematic way, it's one of the most imaginative Australian films yet released in this country. It has no pretensions to do anything except entertain in the primitive, occasionally jolting fashion of the first nickelodeon movies, whose audiences flinched as streetcars lumbered silently toward the camera."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,80,"Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is a straightforward action/adventure film, filled to the brim with over-the-top chases and stunts."
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,91,"Escape from Planet of the Apes is, in fact, a superior film in many ways to the first, but is lacking that film’s freshness and originality. Still: an undeniable high watermark for the franchise."
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,91,"Escape From The Planet Of The Apes gets the series back on track, sending three apes back to the 20th century for a story that begins comically and ends in fear and loathing."
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,90,"Escape from the Planet of the Apes is an excellent film, almost as good as the original Planet of the Apes. Arthur Jacobs’ production is marked by an outstanding script, using some of the original Pierre Boulle novel characters; excellent direction by Don Taylor; and superior performances from a cast headed by encoring Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter."
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,80,"Nobody is going to believe it, but I must say anyway that Don Taylor's Escape From the Planet of the Apes is one of the better new movies in town, and better in a genre—science-fiction—that at the crucial middle level where the history of movies is made, if not written, has recently been not so much bad as invisible."
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,80,McDowell is as good as ever here – this time playing Cornelius – while Kim Hunter is hugely sympathetic as Zira.
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,60,"Former actor Don Taylor directs smoothly and efficiently and elicits fine performances from the cast, highlighted by the warm relationship between Zira, (a touching Kim Hunter) and Cornelius, knowingly played by Roddy McDowall, who returns in the role after being replaced in the first sequel because he was directing a movie (TAM-LIN) at the time."
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,60,"With the potency of the central idea diminishing, Escape still manages the tricky move of carrying on a story that really should have ended with the last film, while setting up the series' mythology and paving the way for future chapters. But it's still a dilution."
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,60,"The utterance of the three gentle chimpanzees in Escape from the Planet of the Apes tends to blow you out of the cinema seat, not so much because they can talk as because they all speak the same language."
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,40,It's a long way down from even the second in the series.
Lone Wolf McQuade,6.4,12232628,88,This is an action movie. It makes no apology for that. But it's high-style action.
Lone Wolf McQuade,6.4,12232628,80,Writer B.J. Nelson has skillfully combined plot elements and situations which draw from the best of Westerns and anti-Establishment cop films.
Lone Wolf McQuade,6.4,12232628,75,"The plot, set in and around El Paso, is unimportant and nonstop, like an old-fashioned, Saturday afternoon serial, which isn't at all bad. Steve Carver, the director, understands that in such films action is content."
Lone Wolf McQuade,6.4,12232628,70,Fans of Soldier of Fortune magazine will think they've been ambushed and blown away to heaven by Lone Wolf McQuade. Every conceivable type of portable weapon on the world market is tried out by the macho warriors on both sides of the law in this modern western.
Lone Wolf McQuade,6.4,12232628,70,"This is one of the better Norris action films, showcasing his astounding martial-arts skills. But the film loses power toward the end when the action bends reality a little too much."
Lone Wolf McQuade,6.4,12232628,50,"As senseless violence goes, this is very senseless and very violent. Norris is a Texas Ranger, Carradine an oily Senator smuggling weapons to 'Central American terrorists', but the storyline has more non sequiturs than bodies, which is saying something."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,91,"It's a crackerjack B movie worthy of comparison to such stylishly low-down, smart-meets-dumb, hyper-violent entertainments as the 1997 Kurt Russell thriller ""Breakdown,"" Clint Eastwood's infamous police bloodbath ""The Gauntlet,"" John Carpenter's original ""Assault on Precinct 13,"" and Arnold's own overlooked 1986 outing ""Raw Deal."""
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,88,"One of its most refreshing aspects is its acceptance of both western and action-film conventions on their own terms, refusing to regard itself as operating outside of or superior to the genre."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,80,"There's savvy in Schwarzenegger's understanding of his appeal. Always foreign yet weirdly Americanized in our dreams, the big guy is a craggy monument in need of a countryside. He's back in the place that deserves him."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,75,"The Last Stand marks the American debut of the Korean director Jee-woon Kim, who delivers a half-dozen quality kills that will leave audiences squirming and then laughing at the sheer audacity of it all."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,75,"Dig just a shade beneath the surface, trade in the text for the subtext, and a more interesting picture emerges – a little richer, sadder, almost poignant. Arnie is back again, yet now, as a storied immigrant nearing the end of his tale, he's become an odd sight to behold."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,75,"It's a struggle at times, mostly because the action-movie clichés haven't been weeded out of the script, but the film is cheerfully, irresistibly destructive - an old-fashioned, ""Rio Bravo"" shoot-'em-up with the hicktown spirit of ""Tremors,"" though it isn't as good as either."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,70,"It's an enjoyably old-fashioned shoot-out, if you can shake off the current headlines and sink in to a fantasy of hyper-violence that plays like an NRA vision of America the Beautiful."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,70,"If that sounds like Schwarzenegger might actually be called on to act this time, you're right. And to his credit, this is the loosest the guy's been in ages. His amiable banter rarely feels forced, and even the obligatory jokes about his age feel genuine."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,70,"The movie comes up with a couple of tender moments that could pass for human, and a mano-a-mano climax in which the superhero of yore, the glint in his eye dulled but not extinguished, functions as a weirdly touching tyrannosaurus."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,70,"Johnny Knoxville offers comic relief as the goofball proprietor of a back-road gun museum, which conveniently allows for an odd assortment of weapons to be used in the climactic battle. It's that kind of movie."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,70,"Kim finally lets loose, and the imaginatively choreographed mayhem that ensues - culminating in two fast cars chasing each other across a pesky cornfield - can be a wonder to behold."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,67,"Despite his acknowledged age, creaking bones, and reduced nerve, Schwarzenegger still delivers quite a performance in this fun, straight-ahead action film."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,63,"The film, directed by South Korean Jee-woon Kim, hits all the necessary action beats and effectively blends in the humor."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,60,Kim Jee-woon's riff on the western is an entertaining frolic back-loaded with gore and guffaws. Arnie's back!
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,60,Arnie's toe-dip back into the action-cinema pool is a daft bit of fluff rather than a bruising mission statement. Get through the plot and you'll be rewarded with 30 minutes of whirligig mayhem.
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,60,"Is it a coincidence that classic action is making its comeback at the same time Schwarzenegger is making his own? Hey, he warned us he'd be back."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,60,"The director does pull off a pretty magnificent cornfield car chase - two sleek vehicles cut through a thick, shaggy carpet of maize like souped-up harvesters, the movie's way of saying that the simple country life needn't be devoid of thrills. But Jee-woon takes too long to wrap things up, fumbling repeatedly on his way to an ending."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,58,"The bloodshed speaks volumes enough, though, even if it takes some time getting to the mayhem proper."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,58,The Last Stand delivers -- up to a point. Keep those expectations reasonable and try not to be disappointed.
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,50,"If only Kim had a sense of humor to match his visual wit.  Instead, we get rusted gags and rubbery acting."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,50,"Kim doesn't sweat interweaving his story threads in any tightly controlled way. Just when the need-for-speed stuff really starts to gain traction, he'll shift for a surprisingly lengthy stretch to comic relief with the deputies and local wacko Johnny Knoxville."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,50,"Sure, violence in movies isn't violence in real life. And when you combine it with intelligent dialogue and pointed social commentary (a la ""Django Unchained""), it can be cathartic. But The Last Stand, absent either of these things, just seems to want to gin up a lot of high-fiving for a lot of shooting, and right now is the least palatable time I can think of for that."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,50,"Almost certainly, The Last Stand will not be Schwarzenegger's last. For better or for worse (and this is somewhere right in the middle), he is back."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,50,"The idea of Arnold Schwarzenegger as a small town sheriff is ludicrous, but then that's the whole point of his new movie: It's dumb fun, emphasis on the dumb."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,50,"[The Director] is especially good at integrating his New Mexico locations into the action, from a key combat scene on a bridge to a car chase that unfolds, with limited visibility, in a cornfield...Kim's handling of his first English-speaking cast isn't quite as assured, although everyone more or less gets by"
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,40,So to call this a good movie is really a stretch; it's more like 38 percent of a good movie. But it probably has just enough dumb fun and pointless violence and car chases to seem like a highly viable option for large numbers of people this weekend.
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,40,"The script is a mess, built on lazy clichés, stilted jokes and easy payoffs. What the movie does have, though, is enthusiasm."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,40,"The South Korean director Kim Jee-woon fails to dazzle with the endless speeding-car sequences, but that 60-second flourish during a lengthy firefight is almost worth the tedium."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,40,Not the worst but is very far from the best film the star has made in his career.
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,38,"It's a junky, crowd-pleasing movie of sidekicks – Guzman and Knoxville – bad acting, over the top shootouts, and catch phrases."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,38,"While the cast includes Luis Guzman (as a buffoonish deputy) and Johnny Knoxville (as a local gun nut), there's no sense that these are real people in a real town, and Schwarzenegger's Sheriff Owens has the weakest backstory of all."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,25,"The movie equivalent of an idiot who, to avoid scorn, starts acting like an even bigger idiot, so as to get in on the joke, too...It takes everything and nothing seriously, depending on what the filmmakers think they can get away with at any given moment, and the result, while not painful to watch, is ridiculous."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,25,That's the thing about this corpse pileup of an action movie. It persistently tries to drag the audience down to its mindless level.
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,83,"The triumph of a film like Upgrade, an unapologetic B-movie, is that it aims low and exceeds expectations."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,82,"Upgrade is an intense sci-fi action thriller with big ideas, incredible action and a remarkable lead performance."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,80,"It’s still a small, silly movie and there’s nothing particularly novel or even of the moment about its technosceptic stance on machines, but as a genre exercise, it’s a fun ride."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,80,"At its best – in a boundless chase round a hackers’ hangout, and a high-speed freeway pursuit – Upgrade is as fluid and exhilarating as anything the Wachowskis signed their names to in the days when they were brothers: the kind of nifty, sometimes nasty surprise our multiplexes sorely need."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,80,"A retro science-fiction actioner with both brains and brawn – quite a lot of brawn, actually. Surely destined for cult status."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,80,"A great and grimy little screw-turner of sci-fi schlock, the kind that they truly don’t make anymore, the kind that would make Carpenter and Cameron proud."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,80,What Whannell wants most to do is torment and eventually pulverize most of the people in his narrative orbit and make you laugh while he does so.
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Leigh Whannell’s new film is exactly the kind of pure trash that feels suited to spaces that are dirty, neglected, a little bit worse for wear. But this is no insult."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Without taking itself too seriously or academically, Upgrade operates with a level of remarkable rigor. This is a film that kicks ass, takes names, and has a healthy skepticism of the future without straying too far away from its B-movie, body horror ambitions."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"An irresistibly gory science-fiction melodrama, is B-movie schlock done right."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Upgrade is a movie by Leigh Whannell, who wrote “Saw,” “Insidious” and other memorable horror movies. But other than the occasional moment of stunningly gratuitous gore, it’s nothing like those films."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Upgrade is a brutish, efficient and well-executed slice of cyberpunk action horror with a silly streak."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Upgrade, Whannell’s second outing behind the camera, is yet another top-notch repair job, this time a kinetic sci-fi riff fashioned from scrap metal and human entrails, nervily updating Cronenbergian body horror for the iOS era."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,Upgrade’s sheer energy and the strength of its concept do more than enough to elevate this revenge picture into something refreshing and eminently watchable.
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Whannell strikes out on his own with his first truly original concept as a writer-director...in a film whose production is as ambitious as its story is formulaic. Thankfully, the former mostly compensates for the latter, making Upgrade a genre-bending summer treat for those who don’t mind a little (okay, a lot) of blood with their popcorn."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,70,"Whannell commits to making a science fiction film plugged into the moment in which we’re living, and making grim projections of what might be around the corner."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,70,"If Upgrade ultimately plays like a genre exercise, it’s certainly a taut, engrossing one."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,70,"Upgrade is an energetic, superficially slick, latter-day B-movie of the “but dumb” category. That is, it’s kind of like “RoboCop,” but dumb, and also like “Ex Machina,” but dumb."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,70,"Infusing its familiar dystopian sci-fi tropes with stylishly gonzo, low-budget filmmaking and inventive narrative flourishes, Upgrade proves far more entertaining than it has a right to be."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,70,"Upgrade offers memorable, legible fights, a compelling bombed-out retro-apocalyptic look and a mystery that seems obvious at the start but then keeps twisting."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,67,Upgrade is a welcome excuse to put Marshall-Green through some delightfully complex fight choreography.
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,63,"Upgrade manages to entice and provoke, impress and terrify, if you let it."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,63,"Like all B-movies, this one provides moments of visceral satisfaction while ignoring nuance and (at times) logic."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,63,"It’s a funny concept, helped by Marshall-Green’s blended look of pleasure and consternation at being the vessel for an invincibility that he enjoys but cannot control."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,63,Whannell is learning how forward motion can allow a filmmaker to get away with some pretty outlandish brutality. I wish the talk-dependent sequences weren’t so foreshadowed and clunky; only Gabriel transcends them.
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,63,"Upgrade is most effective when mining the comical and bizarre love-hate chemistry between Grey and Stem and pairing that singular conflict with batshit-crazy action, but the film’s follow-through is clunky and unfulfilling."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,60,"If it sometimes lapses into genre clichés, Upgrade still delivers on the action front. Just turn your phone off before you go into the cinema, lest it gets ideas."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,60,"The action sequences are electric; they’re grimy, choppy, and strange. But when the characters talk, the film stretches and slows to a banal cautionary tale, almost as if Whannell was making the movie as a homework assignment, having a ton of fun with the aesthetics and the fight scenes, then suddenly remembering he was supposed to incorporate some “themes.”"
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,60,"Whannell’s finite reserves of creativity have been meted out in an imbalance, going all in on world-building while giving the fight choreography and the cinematography listlessly documenting it the short shrift."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,58,"At the end of the day, it’s the action equivalent of a secondhand musical – you’ll most likely come for the dance scenes, and they’re good enough to wade through the filler."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,50,"The film isn’t a dud — it “delivers the goods” in a certain reductive, baseline action-fanboy way. Yet Upgrade is the sort of movie that thinks it’s more ingenious than it is, starting with the premise, which is a semi-catchy, semi-stupido hoot in a way that the movie couldn’t have completely intended."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,50,"If this vaguely cyberpunk, occasionally comic Australian flick were named after its own qualities, it would have been called “Knockoff.”"
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,42,"As a movie, it’s the cinematic equivalent of paint-by-numbers: competent, attractive even, but take a single step closer and the lines peek through. There’s no need to pay money to go see Upgrade: If you select it on a plane and sleep through 60% of it, you’ve seen it in its entirety."
Bloodsport,6.8,11806119,50,"Hacking through the jungle of cliche and reservoir of bad acting in Bloodsport are some pretty exciting matches. It all boils down to a confrontation between a clean-cut noble warrior and a snorting, apish, dirty fighter. As usual, it's no contest."
Bloodsport,6.8,11806119,40,"Forest Whitaker's cameo adds plumage to what is otherwise a well-plucked turkey, humourless and plagued by a script full of stilted mumbo-jumbo."
Bloodsport,6.8,11806119,40,"Bloodsport is strictly for martial arts buffs; little is offered here in the way of plot, dialog, or acting."
Bloodsport,6.8,11806119,25,"The fight scenes are staged cleanly enough by Newt Arnold, a veteran assistant director (to Sam Peckinpah, among others) making his debut at the helm. But the contest format is hopelessly repetitive and inert, the characters would seem underdeveloped in a comic book, and the restricted setting ensures that the action will never develop any real scale or velocity. The Chinese may take it on the chin in Bloodsport, but their own movies are infinitely better."
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,70,"3 Ninjas Kick Back clearly was made with an eye on the international movie market. Set mostly in Japan and adding a female ninja to the three boys, this high-spirited adventure succeeds in conveying the positive and fun elements of both Japanese and American cultures."
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,70,"Writer Mark Saltzman and director Charles T. Kanganis do a fine job of keeping things happening and moving in an easy yet highly kinetic fashion. Although aimed at children, this smart-looking TriStar release is actually more inventive and better-paced than many a comedy for adults."
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,67,"Filled with martial-arts action, bathroom humor, and slapstick, 3 Ninjas Kick Back even has a politically correct kicker: The champion ninja is a girl."
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,63,"Who was this movie made for? Not for me, that's sure, but I have a hunch younger kids will find it satisfying."
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,50,"You don't have to be aligned with the forces of evil to despise this infantile, obnoxious sequel to 1992's surprisingly enjoyable 3 NINJAS."
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,50,Although it is as harmless as its predecessor - and harmless should not be mistaken for a compliment - there is only one sad conclusion to be drawn from this kind of profiteering kiddie fodder: We owe our children better than this.
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,40,A hectic free-for-all with no point at all.
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,38,Junk food laced with testosterone.
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,30,A veritable clinic in irritation. Just thinking about it irritates me deeply.
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,25,"Going from subplot to subplot illustrates the apathy that exists on every level of the filmmaking, from the screenplay to the fight choreography."
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,25,"The movie brings no new material to the screen and banks on the fact that its underage audience has an unschooled memory. Don't insult your kids with this choppy, unimaginative film product."
Lifeforce,6.1,11603545,75,"Watching Lifeforce now is to be reminded that even big-budget films were once allowed to be adventurous and idiosyncratic, even in the 1980s, and that American horror movies were once capable of being fun, sexy, and subversively empathetic."
Lifeforce,6.1,11603545,75,"In film circles there's a name for pictures like Lifeforce. Film Comment magazine has dubbed them guilty pleasures, movies you're embarrassed to admit you like. Maybe somebody spiked my popcorn, but I can't deny that I liked Lifeforce."
Lifeforce,6.1,11603545,75,"It has everything a growing horror freak needs: extreme violence, tons of nudity, vampires, mummies, and apocalyptic bedlam. The movie is slyer and smarter than people give it credit for, and absolutely gorgeous-looking."
Lifeforce,6.1,11603545,60,"Lifeforce is a near-impossible film to review, at once indescribably awful and hugely, brilliantly entertaining."
Lifeforce,6.1,11603545,50,Pic [from the novel The Space Vampires by Colin Wilson] descends into subpar Agatha Christie territory.
Lifeforce,6.1,11603545,50,"Director Tobe Hooper seriously overplays his hand, losing the shape of this 1985 film in a barrage of overblown special effects and screaming Dolby stereo."
Lifeforce,6.1,11603545,50,"As a piece of extraterrestrial-tinged whimsy, Lifeforce occasionally shows weak signs of life, but in the end it falls well short of achieving classic status."
Lifeforce,6.1,11603545,50,"Lifeforce shows off Mr. Hooper's way with a whirling mass of protoplasm, just as Poltergeist did. But its style is shrill and fragmented enough to turn Lifeforce into hysterical vampire porn."
Lifeforce,6.1,11603545,40,"The film is a mess from start to finish with several main characters who appear and disappear throughout. No character development, no thematic development, no narrative development. No life. No force. No dice."
Fair Game,4.2,11534477,50,Fair Game works as a thriller for anyone who lives entirely in the present.
Fair Game,4.2,11534477,50,A thriller primarily about the movement of Cindy Crawford's breasts beneath a succession of ever-smaller T-shirts.
Fair Game,4.2,11534477,50,Will you find yourself wishing you were looking at someone else? Not really.
Fair Game,4.2,11534477,50,"Not bad enough to be good.... This vigorous, pinheaded action flick asks us to accept Cindy as a lawyer."
Fair Game,4.2,11534477,38,This is right up there with the dumbest pictures of the year.
Fair Game,4.2,11534477,25,"Fair Game is howlingly bad - so awful, in fact, that it can actually be enjoyed on a certain level."
Fair Game,4.2,11534477,12,"Fair Game, written and directed by men, allows model Cindy Crawford to make her screen debut as Miami lawyer Kate McQueen."
Fair Game,4.2,11534477,12,"Very slick and extremely silly, not to mention aptly titled, Fair Game is just that - a noisy actioner so inanely scripted, acted, and directed that it practically begs you to make fun of it."
Fair Game,4.2,11534477,12,The only heat that rises from the movie is mechanical.
Fair Game,4.2,11534477,12,"Fair Game is otherwise notable only for its jaw-dropping stupidity, the sort of action yarn that hopes nonstop mayhem will help cloud just how nonsensical it is."
Fair Game,4.2,11534477,11,"The movie is fast, slick and dumb as a post."
Fair Game,4.2,11534477,10,Don't imagine there is any reason to see Fair Game.
Thief,7.4,11492915,100,"Michael Mann’s Thief is one of the most confident directorial debuts of its era, the product of an unprecedented amount of research and preparation."
Thief,7.4,11492915,90,"Debut features are rarely this confident and accomplished, much less such a perfect blueprint of what to expect from a filmmaker down the line."
Thief,7.4,11492915,90,"It's one of those films where you feel the authority right away: This movie knows its characters, knows its story, and knows exactly how it wants to tell us about them."
Thief,7.4,11492915,88,"Although there are points where he gets bogged down in the technical aspects of thievery, the film is a slick Chicago crime-drama with a well-developed sense of pathos running throughout."
Thief,7.4,11492915,80,"Mr. Mann may well become a very good theatrical film maker but, among other things, he's going to have to learn how to edit himself, to resist the temptation to allow dialogue that is colorful to turn, all of a sudden, into deep, abiding purple. Time after time scenes start off well and slip into unintentionally comic excess."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,88,The picture shatters all genre conventions.
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,80,It's easily the most disarming and inventive movie made for genre geeks in years.
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,80,The picture has a daring attention-span deficit and an epic silliness that can be awesomely entertaining.
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,80,"One of the five most popular films of the year in France, ""Wolf"" is a cross-cultural hoot that no one should take too seriously."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,80,"It's impossible not to admire what, apart from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" may be the most ambitious action film since ""The Matrix."""
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,80,Provides glorious escapism without asking you to turn your brain off.
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,80,The film has a wonderful style and a sense of movement that barely slows down for its two and a half hours.
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,75,"I would be lying if I did not admit that this is all, in its absurd and overheated way, entertaining."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,75,"A zestful genre outing, and then some, right up its final overkill."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,75,"Utterly preposterous but so full of enthusiasm and flashy style that it's entertaining anyway, The Brotherhood of the Wolf is like the platypus of genre films."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,75,"Never pretends to be something that it isn't. Oh, there are costumes, to be sure, but that's just to facilitate the setting of the 18th century. Anyone who mistakes this for a costume drama is not aware of what kind of film they have ventured into."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,75,"May be the most purely entertaining foreign-language crossover since ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."""
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,75,"Brotherhood has its goofy side -- it's a sleek, creepily atmospheric popcorn entertainment."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,75,"All manner of superstitions, religious conspiracies and insurrections are aired, resulting less in awe than bewilderment. However, taken as an exciting and expansive cultural bridge, the film is a roaring success."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,70,"A little Sergio Leone here, a little ""Sleepy Hollow"" there, a grand helping of late royal-era Gaul with its wigs and finery, and, uh, martial arts-style confrontations galore are all deftly melded in Brotherhood of the Wolf."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,70,"This is one of those follies that go beyond pesky, bourgeois notions of ''good'' and ''bad.''"
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,70,"Despite an overlong running time and a punishing amount of violence and gore, it's a deeply ambitious picture, one of the most expensive and original to come out of France in many years."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,67,"The perfect film for anyone who likes their headbutting and kickboxing dressed up in gold brocade, frilly collars, and tri-cornered caps. And isn't that all of us?"
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,67,"At 140 minutes, the film becomes a humorless, long-winded spectacle."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,63,You have to admire a movie that endeavors to moosh together every successful cross-cultural action picture ever made.
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,58,Much of the historical horrorfest is more frenetic than fascinating. Look out for bursts of over-the-top violence.
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,50,Must we import the rubbish we export?
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,50,"Whatever it is, it's simultaneously on speed and Quaaludes; I don't know if any movie this profoundly insane has been seen in general release since Antonia Bird's Gold Rush cannibal comedy ""Ravenous."""
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,50,This new take on horror is more of the bloody same.
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,50,An exuberantly garish French movie.
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,50,"Has its moments. In fact, it has too many of them. At 2 hours and 20 minutes and with enough characters to take up a few floors at a big hotel, it feels about an act too long."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,40,"Too ludicrous to be taken seriously, but not entertaining enough to rate as camp."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,40,"This one's a turkey as big as the Eiffel Tower but it's bad in a particularly American way: It's wildly overdone, it throws in everything in an attempt to appeal to everyone, it's gargantuan and anti-logical, pointlessly ornate and pointlessly violent."
Zorro: The Gay Blade,6.1,11118000,80,"This 'affectionate parody' of the swashbuckling Zorro myth is so determinedly amiable that one feels distinctly caddish for regretting that the laughs are not even more frequent. It fails only in that Leibman's villain shouts too much, and that the set pieces, the skeleton of most film comedy, are under-considered."
Zorro: The Gay Blade,6.1,11118000,80,"Despite an inspired, offbeat performance by George Hamilton, Zorro, the Gay Blade doesn't have nearly enough gags to sustain its 93 minutes. For the most part this is a Zorro with a very dull edge."
Zorro: The Gay Blade,6.1,11118000,70,"This movie is, of course, intended as a comedy, and it has some funny moments. But it's just not successful, and I think the reason is that Hamilton never for a second plays Zorro as if he were really playing Zorro... When a movie sets out a create a funny Zorro, that's bringing coals to Newcastle. By playing every scene for laughs, Hamilton has nothing to play against."
Zorro: The Gay Blade,6.1,11118000,70,"This one-joke film beats its punch line to death, playing its gay character for big laughs with generally predictable and boring results. Hamilton (who coproduced) chews up the scenery with relish, and the bland supporting performances yield to his campy caricature, But the subtle element of self-parody that distinguished the best of the Zorro films is absent, and the gay stereotype is more offensive than comical."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,90,"Big Trouble in Little China is a far more enjoyable mash-up of classic Westerns, Saturday-morning serials, and Chinese wu xia than any of the Indiana Jones movies, with Kurt Russell in full bloom as Carpenter’s de rigueur hard-drinkin’, hard-gamblin’, wise-crackin’ loner hero—a bowling-alley John Wayne."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,83,"There are two kinds of people: the ones who have seen — and love — Big Trouble in Little China, a John Carpenter kung fu Western buddy Chinese ghost love story, and those poor saps who aren’t burdened with having to try and describe it to the uninitiated."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,80,"What matters is the stunts and the spirit, and this latest set of exotic exploits of an indomitable hero (Kurt Russell) and a spunky heroine (Kim Cattrall) gives good value."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,70,"Big Trouble is plenty conscious of its silliness, which it embraces fully. It sets up its own parameters of ridiculousness and then runs with them, winking a little, but sticking to its story."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,60,"It falters a little in its confusing climactic battle, but is breathlessly paced, wittily scripted, amusingly played, action-packed and relentlessly spooky."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,60,"Carpenter has always been a skilful genre mechanic, breathing life into old forms; if he stubs his toes up against the bamboo curtain this time, there is still more enjoyable sly humour than in most slug-fests."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,60,"Written and directed in a campy, tongue-in-cheek style, it's a loving homage to those wild imports from Hong Kong--kung-fu movies."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,50,"The first 30 minutes of the movie gave me lots of room for hope. It was fast-moving, it was visually spectacular, it was exotic and lighthearted and filled with a spirit of adventure. But then, gradually, the movie began to recycle itself. It began to feel as if I was seeing the same thing more than once."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,50,Director John Carpenter seems to be trying to make an action-adventure along the lines of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. The effect goes horribly awry.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"Quite simply, House of Flying Daggers is a film that sets several new standards for production and entertainment values. It is a wild riot of color, music, passion, action, mystery, pure old-fashioned thrills and even dancing."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"It's great, fantastical fun."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,House of Flying Daggers finds the great Chinese director at his most romantic in this thrilling martial arts epic that involves a conflict between love and duty carried out to its fullest expression.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"The most gorgeous movie of the year. This smashing martial-arts romance from Chinese director Zhang Yimou is stunning in other ways, too, like the eroticism that ripples just beneath the surface."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,The movie equivalent of a 12-course feast crammed with unforgettable images and mind-boggling stunts.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"The cast list is like a convocation of the Three Chinas: Taiwan's Kaneshiro, Hong Kong's Lau and the mainland's Zhang Ziyi. All are terrific, but the lady shines brightest."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"It's as thrilling and lushly beautiful a movie as has been released all year, matched only by Zhang's epic ""Hero."" And I think this film is the more powerful."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"Chinese director Zhang Yimou understands perfectly that the small can be epic and awe-inspiring. And, by the way, he knows how to get big, too."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,Zhang weaves in both thrilling martial-arts set pieces and stunning studies of period silk tapestry and costume.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"Forget about the plot, the characters, the intrigue, which are all splendid in House of Flying Daggers, and focus just on the visuals."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,The sheer joy of letting go as a tale overwhelms your senses and drives the known world away -- that's the story.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,This is the most intoxicatingly beautiful martial arts picture I've ever seen.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"It's action opera, sword-and-sorcery song-and-dance, and it's a heart-pumping, jaw-dropping thrill. OK, so I kind of like the thing."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,Its exquisiteness can overwhelm in a single sitting.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,By turns breathtaking and heartbreaking.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"He's (Yimou) like a painter combining bloody reds, sunshine yellows and pale blues in the harmony of a masterpiece."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"An outrageously gorgeous spectacle of balletic aggression. At the same time, it offers something we rarely encounter in a whirling martial-arts extravaganza: a romantic passion that's woven into the very fabric of the action."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,91,A glorious new addition to martial-arts cinema.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,90,"I don't know if the many plot swerves withstand a second viewing, but I suspect the meat of the matter – the swooning visuals, the expert choreography, the teasing love story – does."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,89,"Forget ""Hero"" -- that cult hit was just Zhang Yimou's warm-up for this martial-arts fireball that throws in a lyrical love story, head-spinning fights and dazzling surprises."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,88,The result is one of the most visually astonishing martial-arts fantasies ever made.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,88,"The second action melodrama released in the United States this year by director Zhang Yimou, and if I prefer the previous one, ""Hero,"" it's partly a matter of degrees."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,83,The tangled tale of love and disguise is awesome in its action sequences but doesn't touch the heart to the same degree.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,80,"The most seamless piece of sensuous expressionism Zhang has created since ""Ju Dou"" (1990)."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,80,"A gorgeous entertainment, a feast of blood, passion and silk brocade. But though the picture is full of swirling, ecstatic motion, it is not especially moving."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,80,"You feel wiped and blinded by such ravishment, yet a voice within you asks: Come on, guys, can't you just stop for the holidays?"
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,80,This is how action movies should be made.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,80,"If you think ""Hero"" is a sumptuous film, prepare to be blown away by House of Flying Daggers."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,75,"All told, while the goods that Daggers offers are choice, the movie ultimately demonstrates that too much can be, well, more than enough."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,75,It's a perfect example of how far production design and editing WON'T take you when the story's not there.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,75,"Actors Zhang Ziyi and Takeshi Kaneshiro are the kind of startlingly good-looking, glamorous stars that evoke classic Hollywood adventure films."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,75,"Choreographed to the last beat, the action scenes have a depth that the film's thinly sketched characters never quite develop."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,70,If only this epic had enough substantial melodramatic hooks to hang this woman's beauty on; emotional traction is most often buried under acres of carefully coordinated vistas and CGI-hued flora.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,70,This film pivots on a romantic triangle as overwrought as it is stylized. It's like a Douglas Sirk melodrama ratcheted up with fists of fury and wrapped in apparently endless yards of shimmering silk.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,70,"It's exuberant, exhilarating, poetic and -- intentionally and not -- rather silly."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,67,Beautiful but hollow.
Gator,5.8,11000000,60,"Too much of this is tedious, rather like off-cuts from his recent movies, but the reasonable photography and good action material help. Country singer Jerry Reed makes a good heavy, and when Reynolds keeps it simple, his direction suggests the makings of a modest craftsman."
Gator,5.8,11000000,50,An entertaining piece of good ol' boy fluff with plenty of car and boat chases.
Gator,5.8,11000000,50,"This follow-up to White Lightning never takes itself seriously, veering as it does through many incompatible dramatic and violent moods for nearly two hours."
Gator,5.8,11000000,50,"Structurally, Gator is a bit of a mess, largely because of the civilizing and romantic influence Reynolds has brought to the randy domain of the redneck action film."
Gator,5.8,11000000,50,"Gator is yet another Good Ol' Movie, and not, I fear, the summer's last. If only it had a Good Ol' Plot worth a damn, it might have even been a halfway tolerable ol' movie."
D-War,3.6,10977721,63,"Frankly, it's dumb, but no dumber than ""Transformers."""
D-War,3.6,10977721,50,"A feast of A-grade f/x married to a Z-grade, irony-free script."
D-War,3.6,10977721,50,"It is such a breathless, delirious stew, it’s impossible not to be entertained, provided -- this is crucial -- you have a sense of humor."
D-War,3.6,10977721,40,"While the CGI effects are undeniably impressive, the laughable story line, risible dialogue and cheap humor (most of it involving a hapless zoo security guard) seriously detract from the fun."
D-War,3.6,10977721,38,"You don't have to hand the folks behind Dragon Wars much (the acting, directing, costumes, editing, props, music, etc: They're all off). But when they decide to sic that giant snake and those prehistoric dino-birds on downtown Los Angeles, the movie turns shockingly watchable."
D-War,3.6,10977721,30,This one’s for connoisseurs of the “totally preposterous crap” school of fantasy cinema.
D-War,3.6,10977721,30,Fluent in the laughable dialogue of a million bad fantasy flicks:
D-War,3.6,10977721,30,This South Korean pseudo-epic is some of the most ambitious cr-- I've ever seen.
D-War,3.6,10977721,16,"All the thought seems to have gone into the marketing, and none into the unfathomably terrible script."
Gotcha!,6.2,10806919,50,"As a thriller it has its moments, as a romance it's sometimes touching, but as a comedy it's too often a bust."
Gotcha!,6.2,10806919,50,"The basic mistake in the movie isn't in the pacing, but in the storytelling. They've made the movie about its less interesting major character."
Gotcha!,6.2,10806919,40,"Gotcha is a hopelessly shallow film, serving up a good deal of hokum in the ridiculous plot. It's a contrived idea to start with, and the script goes through predictable twist after twist until the inevitable conclusion."
Gotcha!,6.2,10806919,30,Gotcha is about as devoid of personality as it's possible for a narrative movie to be.
RoboCop 3,4,10696210,63,"The familiarity of the high-armour shoot-outs and sfx-assisted set-pieces make most of this sequel feel surprisingly low-tech. Not bad entertainment, though."
RoboCop 3,4,10696210,63,"There's probably sufficient energy and violence in RoboCop 3 to satisfy undemanding action fans, but it's as mechanical as its cyborg hero."
RoboCop 3,4,10696210,60,"Though the story is tired, most of ROBOCOP 3's action sequences and special effects are imaginative and effective, and the gruesomeness of the first two films has been toned down in a commercially wise attempt to make it more accessible to the younger audiences who love Robocop."
RoboCop 3,4,10696210,58,"Unsurprisingly this is the worst in the RoboCop trilogy, with the plot proving ridiculous, excelling itself particularly in the climax. For what was a promising debut, it's reputation was quickly tarnished with the drivvel such as this that followed."
RoboCop 3,4,10696210,50,"This latest widget off the RoboCop assembly line is a bit better than the first sequel, which amounts to damnation with faint praise. Limiting the gore, but not the carnage, in pursuit of a PG-13 rating and more youngsters, pic remains a cluttered, nasty exercise that seems principally intent on selling action figures."
RoboCop 3,4,10696210,50,"Why do they persist in making these retreads? Because RoboCop is a brand name, I guess, and this is this year's new model. It's an old tradition in Detroit to take an old design and slap on some fresh chrome."
RoboCop 3,4,10696210,50,"The movie, which is deadly slow and full of Japanese-bashing, is also an undisguised merchandising promo."
RoboCop 3,4,10696210,50,"As for the conflict, it's hardly riveting and often it's downright silly. The sets and effects betray their downsized budget. And the Japanese bashing is less artful than in Rising Sun, though just as obnoxious."
RoboCop 3,4,10696210,40,"About as two-dimensional as a comic book, RoboCop 3 should be regarded as the last strike-out."
Primeval,4.8,10597734,67,"Pit a reptile the size of a school bus against an American TV-news crew in war-scarred Burundi, and you get ""Hotel Rwanaconda,"" a horror movie interested in cheesy scares and drawing attention to the plight of poor Africans. (So no, Primeval is not the '""serial killer'"" film promised by the ads.)"
Primeval,4.8,10597734,50,"It's not exactly good, but it's not bad, and far from boring."
Primeval,4.8,10597734,40,"Strangely self-serious, and without covering the prerequisites of top-shelf nastiness that contemporary horror requires, this giant crocodile movie turns out to be neither fish nor fowl."
Primeval,4.8,10597734,40,"The screenplay, by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, tosses out a few chewy bits of B-movie wit, most of them supplied by Mr. Jones, who expresses the ambivalence of an African-American visiting the motherland through a series of bitter jokes."
Primeval,4.8,10597734,38,"One of the few monster-crocodile movies that simultaneously tries to rip off ""Jaws"" and ""Meet the Press."""
Primeval,4.8,10597734,38,"Primeval is a hoot if you're in the mood, though, and it gets points for trying to stuff a little globo-think into the minds of Friday night mayhem fans (who will probably rebel, since only one skull pops like a grape)."
Primeval,4.8,10597734,38,"Though a few scenes drum up some intensity -- that green ham Gustave makes one last great appearance -- it's mostly grim, dull and ugly, three qualities that nobody wants in a piece of multiplex filler about a surly reptile."
Primeval,4.8,10597734,33,"If there were a shred of sincerity to its straight-faced exposé of African strife, the film would be easier to forgive, but since it's really just a cheap horror-thriller about an ancient predator, the austere tone does it no favors."
Primeval,4.8,10597734,30,"With a little camp, this could have been fun --see ""Lake Placid"" or ""Anaconda."""
Primeval,4.8,10597734,30,"A low-rent monster movie that could well have been released by American International in the early 1970s, Primeval boasts a level of cheesiness that should well merit it a regular rotation on late-night cable."
Primeval,4.8,10597734,25,"By the end of the film, I was hoping everyone on two legs would die, preferably suffering as much on screen as I was in the audience."
American Ninja,5.4,10499694,50,"Ridiculous scripting and frequently comical budget limitations make this film a mostly awful trip to Bruce Lee Land, though the fight scenes, choreographed by Mike Stone, a karate champion and former partner of Chuck Norris, are spectacular and not as silly as the usual Hong Kong product. For fans of the genre only."
American Ninja,5.4,10499694,40,"Director Sam Firstenberg stages the numerous action scenes well, but engenders little interest in the non-story."
Silent Rage,5.5,10490791,50,"[Norris] is a kind of whitebread Bruce Lee, with no screen presence to speak of, but nothing terribly offensive working against him, either. He is just sort of there...Silent Rage may be trying to say something here about wealthy technicians and the popular culture, but then the psychopath or Mr. Norris appear and the thought gets lost."
Silent Rage,5.5,10490791,40,"The idea of pitting karate champion Norris against a virtually indestructible psychopath is intriguing, but the resulting confusion of clichés proves disappointingly incompetent."
Silent Rage,5.5,10490791,40,"Filled with implausibilities and unintentionally funny moments, this early Norris feature was little more than an excuse for the actor to use his karate skills. Exploitative in nature, but popular with its audiences."
Silent Rage,5.5,10490791,30,Silent Rage seems as if it were made with a demographics sampler entitled ’10 Sleazy Ways to Cash in on the Exploitation Market’. The result is a combination horror-kung fu-oater-woman in peril-mad scientist film with more unintentional laughs than possible in the space of 100 minutes.
House of the Dead,2,10249719,50,Whether this is a good or bad thing depends on just how much 14-year-old boy you've got in ya.
House of the Dead,2,10249719,40,"There's scarcely a whiff of originality in the zombie horror picture House of the Dead, but Uwe Boll has directed it with enough energy and style that it adds up to passably mindless if grisly fun."
House of the Dead,2,10249719,38,"Director Uwe Boll wholeheartedly embraces the film's concept, and with some fancy editing and a pulsing soundtrack, the effect really is like watching a video game."
House of the Dead,2,10249719,30,Dull and unimaginative.
House of the Dead,2,10249719,25,Unimaginatively recycles all the teens-in-the-woods gorefest conventions.
House of the Dead,2,10249719,25,"Somewhere between cartoonishly bad for comic effect and bad because the filmmakers didn't really give a damn, The House of the Dead is, at least, unpretentiously dumb."
House of the Dead,2,10249719,25,"House of the Dead, sadly, is so bad it's bad."
House of the Dead,2,10249719,20,"Does little more than add another title to the very long list of movies influenced by George Romero's 1968 horror classic, ""Night of the Living Dead."""
House of the Dead,2,10249719,20,"Much poorly choreographed gunplay, many lovingly rendered head explosions, and some half-assed exposition about centuries-old, immortality-seeking pirates follow, with nothing to recommend House Of The Dead to anyone but the most undiscriminating zombie-movie fans."
House of the Dead,2,10249719,20,"Heres a would-be horror film that contains not one ounce of professional pride in its making, not one shred of technical competence. This is one of the worst films of recent times."
House of the Dead,2,10249719,20,Laughable performances.
House of the Dead,2,10249719,20,Prochnow rocks; nothing else does.
House of the Dead,2,10249719,0,"Based on a video game, far exceeds expectations -- in negative ways that inspire thoughts of less than zero stars."
House of the Dead,2,10249719,0,"To properly convey the jaw-dropping shoddiness of this videogame-based ''horror'' ''movie,'' one must approach what scientists call Absolute Stupid, a state previously thought to exist only under highly controlled laboratory conditions or at the highest levels of government."
House of the Dead,2,10249719,0,"Its cheese of the purest stripe, bafflingly bad to the point of being oddly charming in its brain dead naïveté."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,100,"Straightforward, energetic, updated Bard. 28-year-old star-director-adapter Kenneth Branagh's spellbinding version of Shakespeare's Henry isn't superior to Olivier's 1944 version - it's different, and complementary to it."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,100,"Big and pretty, vigorous, thoughtful, this Hamlet expands the story with helpful flashbacks."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,90,"Most astounding, though, is the power of the film's leading actor. While Branagh's direction is forthright and articulate, his acting is brash and flamboyant."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,90,"What works best in the film is the over-all vision. Branagh is able to see himself as a king, and so we can see him as one."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,88,"The cast - including Derek Jacobi as the modern-dress chorus, Paul Scofield, Judi Dench, Ian Holm, Emma Thompson, and Robbie Coltrane in an effective cameo as Falstaff - is uniformly fine without any grandstanding."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,88,"Branagh's Henry V must, however, be counted a success - it might never be as famous as Olivier's, but it should carry considerable clout for years to come."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,88,"Mr. Branagh has made a fine, rousing new English film adaptation of Shakespeare's ''Henry V,'' a movie that need not apologize to Laurence Olivier's 1944 classic."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,88,"Henry V is a stirring, gritty and enjoyable pic which offers a plethora of fine performances from some of the U.K.'s brightest talents."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,80,"An alert, rousing interpretation of ""Henry V,"" Branagh beats down the doors of high art and drags the sleeping bard into the light of modern day."
Cutthroat Island,5.6,10017322,75,"Cutthroat Island is everything a movie named Cutthroat Island should be, and no more. It is a pirate picture, pure and simple, and doesn't transcend its genre except perhaps in the luxurious production. Leaner and meaner pirate movies have worked more or less as well, but this one gets the job done."
Cutthroat Island,5.6,10017322,63,"Cutthroat Island is a mindless diversion. If, for whatever reason, you decide to go, maintain low expectations. Hoping for more than a bunch of loud bangs and ridiculous dialogue will rob Cutthroat Island of its amusement value."
Cutthroat Island,5.6,10017322,63,"Harlin is never a man to shy away from the lure of Very Big Explosions, and, on a technical level, the spectacle's impressive. The only actor to make much of an impact is Malahide's colonial officer, who extracts tart irony from the merest crumbs."
Cutthroat Island,5.6,10017322,50,"Renny Harlin's big, chaotic pirate flick is best understood as an attempt to revive the waning career of his wife, Geena Davis, but he's done her no great favor. As Morgan Adams, a sort of distaff Errol Flynn, poor Geena gets lost in a hectic scenario that's littlemore than an excuse for a series of thunderous explosions, clanky sword battles and run-of-the-mill spectacular stunts."
Cutthroat Island,5.6,10017322,50,"It's mindless entertainment, but its critical and commercial failure doomed the pirate genre to a watery grave."
Cutthroat Island,5.6,10017322,50,"What seemed like a dubious proposition on paper plays even more dubiously onscreen, as Cutthroat Island strenuously but vainly attempts to revive the thrills of old-fashioned pirate pictures. Giving most of the swashbuckling opportunities to star Geena Davis, pic does little with its reversal of gender expectations and features a seriously mismatched romantic duo in Davis and Matthew Modine."
Cutthroat Island,5.6,10017322,50,"Cutthroat Island is a bloated, jokey production whose motto, no doubt tattooed on the back of some poor assistant director's neck, could well be, When in doubt, blow something up."
Cutthroat Island,5.6,10017322,50,"It's a swashbuckling extravaganza, but Davis is not convincing. And before anyone objects, it's not because she's a woman. Get out already! This is the '90s, and women can do anything. But they can't escape from a lousy movie any better than a man can."
Cutthroat Island,5.6,10017322,40,"Cutthroat Island proves too stupidly smutty for children, too cartoonish for sane adults and not racy enough for anyone who regards Ms. Davis in a tight-laced bodice as its main attraction. The only serious incentive for seeing this spectacle is a fascination with extravagance, since Cutthroat Island is indeed scenic, hectic and big."
Cutthroat Island,5.6,10017322,40,"The movie is a turgid, swollen, wheezing old contraption, a crashing bore of special effects in which the most exciting moment gives us two ships sitting in water sending cannon balls at each other for what seems like hours on end."
Cutthroat Island,5.6,10017322,40,"It takes a two-hour act of will to keep facing the screen during this moribund movie. Every cliffhanger is enough to make you a cliff jumper. Davis and Modine are almost transcendentally unappealing, as they weather dull sword fights, ship-to-ship exchanges and other action-movie banalities."
Cutthroat Island,5.6,10017322,38,"Who thought letting Harlin steer into Captain Blood territory was a sage idea? To a piece that’s intended as a comic, tongue-in-cheek romp, he brings the same brutal, slo-mo pyrotechnics that lit up both his hits (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger) and his biggest previous miss (The Adventures of Ford Fairlane). Somewhere, Errol Flynn is wincing."
Cloak & Dagger,6.6,9719000,75,"Cloak benefits from tight direction and the good humor of the Holland script. The addition of the dual role for Coleman (who's excellent in both) serves to highlight the relationship between father and son, adding another dimension to the yarn and almost relegating the spy plot from the core element of the story to mere diversion."
Cloak & Dagger,6.6,9719000,75,"Cloak and Dagger is fun for adults as well as older kids, thanks to the imaginative writing (by Tom Holland) and direction (by Richard Franklin)."
Cloak & Dagger,6.6,9719000,70,"Coleman and Thomas are unusually sympathetic embodiments of a father and son, and they have some moments that are legitimately stirring. Cloak & Dagger is never as adept or perceptive as you'd like it to be, but it's got what members of the critical fraternity traditionally characterize as a little something."
Cloak & Dagger,6.6,9719000,70,"In addition to tossing in the occasional spy-movie homage (there's certainly a Hitchcock touch to Mr. Franklin's choice of villains), he has kept the story moving and the actors lively."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,100,"By allowing viewers to step into the shoes of a wall-climbing Jackie Chan, a parkour-sprinting Daniel Craig or a bullet-spraying Ahnold, it does something that live action has never attempted before. The carnage flies—it’s possible to miss a lot of it. But if action movies are meant to be stunning, Hardcore Henry can proudly take its place among the giants. Even better, it lets you stand with them."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,78,The film is an exhilarating and inventive spectacle that makes every other action film from the last 10 years look as obsolete as the Lumière brothers running that train at you back in 1896.
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,75,Is it much of a movie? Not really. It’s more of an experience – a passive sort of virtual reality – that uses a bare-bones narrative as a vehicle for a big-time body count.
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,75,"A head-spinning, whirling dervish of an action movie."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,75,The film's unbelievably precise choreography of action seeks to tap into a universal feeling of powerlessness.
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,70,"Hardcore feels like umpteen post-“Star Wars” action blockbusters trash-compacted into one — and whether that fundamentally appeals or not, the ingenuity of effort is undeniably high."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,70,"Hardcore blasts along like a supercharged computer-game shoot-em-up, bursting with sick humor and splatterpunk violence."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,67,"It feels longer than 90 minute because, despite changing locations frequently enough, Ilya Naishuller‘s debut feature never really has a strong sense of structure nor escalation to make it as truly kinetic as it wants. Yet, at least to some degree, the right spirit is there to lift it through some of the deadening stretches."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,65,"Presented with a moral universe where annihilation is all, it’s difficult to invest in the film as anything more significant than a breathless series of punishing vignettes."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,63,"It's all about the ride, the relentless wallop and whoosh. But, hey, sometimes that's all a cine-junkie needs for a fix."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,63,"Hardcore Henry is like a good roller-coaster in that it does not require a complex reason to be: it's there, it's fun, you ride it, and that's about it."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,58,"It never crystallizes into a singular experience, and instead collapses in a rush of well-intentioned innovations."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,50,You have a movie with everything it needs save one crucial element: emotion.
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,50,A hypercaffeinated first-person action flick that teeters somewhere between gonzo insanity and a nausea-inducing endurance test.
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,50,"The sense of goofy, if gory, good humor [Copley] brings to Hardcore Henry goes a long way toward mitigating the film’s tedious barbarity."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,50,"When the action is at its sharpest, such as with Henry’s mid-chase leap from a detonating truck onto the back of a motorcycle, it’s spectacular."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,50,"If one can accept the story’s videogame logic and cope with the kinetosis, “Hardcore” is often exhilaratingly extreme."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,50,The film starts to risk adrenaline fatigue after the first hour.
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,50,"Shot with head-mounted GoPro cameras, the Russian-made action flick Hardcore Henry mimics the experience of watching someone else play a very derivative first-person shooter with sub-Duke Nukem humor."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,42,"Sure, there's a bit of spectacle to the film's utterly ridiculous violence. Even that dulls, however, without character or stakes to inject urgency into the parade of broken bodies."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,40,Hardcore Henry is a single-gear novelty that never achieves real liftoff.
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,40,"Its dour eccentricity gives Hardcore Henry a potency above and beyond that of standard-issue show-off action fare. That doesn’t mean it’s not still obnoxious, though."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,40,"The film turned out to be plodding and boring. No one can accuse Hardcore Henry of being plodding. It does get to be boring, but in the high-tech, cutting-edge mode of first-person-shooter videogames that dazzle your eyes, spark your synapses and numb your brain."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,40,"The visuals are undeniably impressive at times, as Henry parkours around the city or during a particularly tense shoot-out, but they also struggle with inevitable motion sickness of the frenetic handheld camerawork."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,40,"Naishuller’s technique is one that could be well served as a shorter gimmick; a solitary action scene in a larger film. Hardcore is unrelenting and unforgiving in its commitment to be loud, fast, destructive and gross."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,38,"Never again let it be said that an action movie is just like a video game.
Hardcore Henry, a frenetic, dizzying, and ultraviolent actioner from Russian rocker-turned-director Ilya Naishuller is one - a first-person shooter writ large for the big screen."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,38,Hardcore Henry is jarring and so a-cinematic that I couldn’t enjoy much of the technical razzle-dazzle this ticking-clock monstrosity was hurling at me.
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,30,"While its audacity is laudable, the film ultimately has all the thrill of watching someone else play a first-person-shooter video game."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,25,"It’s breathtaking. It’s dazzling. It’s world-altering, is what it is. For the first time ever, a movie has actually done it. Hardcore Henry has precisely replicated the experience of watching someone else play a video game."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,0,"Stupid as a bag of hammers and twice as loud, Hardcore Henry sounds like the title of the worst Kissinger bio ever. Actually, it's an action movie that feels more like you are trapped in a video game. A really, really bad video game."
Traffik,6,9186156,70,"An effective weekend-from-hell thriller with a vital message, a terrific lead performance by Paula Patton and some unexpectedly dimensional storytelling from writer-director Deon Taylor (""Meet the Blacks"")."
Traffik,6,9186156,55,"It’s kind of hard to know where to begin with what’s wrong in Traffik, a movie where every scene takes about twice as long as it feels like it should, and the characters far too often make an escalating series of implausible and/or stupid decisions."
Traffik,6,9186156,42,"Trying to figure it out makes Traffik weirdly compelling, but nowhere near good."
Traffik,6,9186156,40,"There doesn’t seem to be any insidious motivation behind writer/director Deon Taylor’s vision for his film, no purposeful undermining of the real impact of sex slavery by coating it in a veneer similar to what can modestly be described as a highly eroticized, run-off-the-mill basic cable home invasion thriller. It’s misguided, not nefarious."
Traffik,6,9186156,40,"An attractive cast led by a vibrant, all-in Paula Patton and spiffy visuals courtesy of renowned cinematographer Dante Spinotti make the sleaze and predictable plotting go down a bit easier than they would have otherwise, but there's still no disguising the project's fundamentally lurid underpinnings."
Traffik,6,9186156,40,"Noble intentions are derailed by deeply confused execution in writer-director Deon Taylor’s Traffik, which attempts to marry cheap genre thrills with an unflinching depiction of the horrors of international sex trafficking, only to cheapen the latter and cast a grimy pall over the former."
Traffik,6,9186156,38,"Traffik isn’t a very good thriller, and if you aren’t two or three steps ahead of it, much of the time, you need more practice."
Traffik,6,9186156,38,"Deon Taylor seems uncomfortable with the escalating relentlessness of a siege film, eventually splitting Traffik off into a variety of other tangents and genres, diluting the potent subtext at the film's center."
Traffik,6,9186156,30,"Noble intentions, ignoble results."
Traffik,6,9186156,12,Traffik begins with that classic cinematic lie “inspired by true events” and ends with statistics for women who have been victims of human trafficking. Between these two bookends is a steaming pile of exploitative horse manure masquerading as a feature concerned with the sexual enslavement of women.
Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,6.1,9000000,91,"The Planet of the Apes films had always been political, but with Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, things got angry. And it was awesome."
Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,6.1,9000000,70,"The Planet of the Apes series takes an angry turn in the fourth entry, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes."
Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,6.1,9000000,60,"An allegorical fable of fascism and slavery, CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is the best of the four sequels in the hugely successful APES series, as well as being the darkest and most violent."
Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,6.1,9000000,50,"It's not bad, as apes and 20th Century-Fox go, at least hand in hand."
Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,6.1,9000000,40,"Wringing the last drops out of the idea, it strains to stay on-side, but it remains true enough to the spirit of the series to get it over the line."
Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,6.1,9000000,30,"Dismally lurid stuff, ham-fistedly directed and low on credibility."
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,63,"Leisurely and overly familiar pic should appeal to young teen girls, but won't be breaking any B.O. bricks with its bare hands."
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,50,This film feels like a desperate attempt to squeeze a few last bucks out of what was once a very obliging cash cow.
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,50,"The fourth film in the series, the newest installment has a new director, Chris Cain, and a female Kid, Hilary Swank, but otherwise it reprises the formula established by John G. Avildsen in 1984: A troubled teen conquers self-doubt and the local bullies with the help of an enigmatic karate teacher."
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,50,"If this installment is just slightly less laborious than Karate Kid II or III, it's not from Mark Lee's surprise-free script or Christopher Cain's placid direction, but because young Swank really might be a find. Early on, she's such a convincingly testy teen that parents may flinch, but she does seem to blossom before your eyes."
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,50,"Overlong and utterly predictable, The Next Karate Kid offers little excitement, even in its culminating fight sequence."
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,50,"Clearly, three sequels haven’t improved Miyagi’s English, but there is something bitchin’ about seeing a babe give a bully a good thwack. Not that girls will go see this or boys will care."
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,50,Almost a guilty pleasure. But not quite.
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,42,"There's really nothing new here (as if anyone expected there would be), but it's a decent enough entry into the Karate Kid series, if you don't mind having seen it all done before, and better."
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,40,"The Next Karate Kid is harmless as children's entertainment, but for 104 very long minutes, there isn't a recognizable human being in sight."
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,40,It should be obvious to anyone at this point in time that Kid is getting a little long in the tooth. As Miyagi might say: Those who keep milking same idea . . . end up killing cash cow.
Nightbreed,6.6,8862354,90,"While Cronenberg works, the two other main humans - Boone and his girlfriend, are flat and boring, mostly due to uninspired performances. Still, that's like blasting Star Wars for Mark Hamill's acting. While this isn't as great as Star Wars, it's in the same vein, and if Nightbreed had made some loot, I think we would have gotten some very cool sequels with a fantastic mythology."
Nightbreed,6.6,8862354,70,"At its best, Nightbreed is like a living version of a coffee-table book, with each page filled with tentacled, quilled, or moon-faced monsters."
Nightbreed,6.6,8862354,60,"The background is more intriguing than the stumbling up-front story, and monster watchers will get full use of the freeze-frame facility."
Nightbreed,6.6,8862354,58,"Barker spins grisly fantasy out of sexual obsession, yet his style here couldn’t be less obsessive. It’s cluttered and rather incoherent, as though the trailers to four different horror movies had been spliced together."
Nightbreed,6.6,8862354,50,In Nightbreed neither the coyly horrible killers nor the horribly coy monsters register strongly enough. It's a dark beast with a flabby hide.
Nightbreed,6.6,8862354,50,"Surrounded by Mr. Barker's visual clutter and lack of narrative energy, Mr. Cronenberg's presence only highlights the difference between a gruesome but first-rate psychological horror story like Dead Ringers and a mediocrity like Nightbreed."
Nightbreed,6.6,8862354,50,Barker the filmmaker resorts to most of the horror cliches he chillingly sidesteps in his writing.
Nightbreed,6.6,8862354,40,"Writer-director Clive Barker's Nightbreed is a mess. Self-indulgent horror pic [from his novel Cabal] could be the Heaven's Gate of its genre, of obvious interest to diehard monster fans but a turnoff for mainstream audiences."
Nightbreed,6.6,8862354,40,"Barker calls his shambolic, uninvolving narrative 'scattershot'; put less kindly, it's as explosive and directionless as a blunderbuss."
Nightbreed,6.6,8862354,40,"Besides a lot of scenic driving in and around Calgary, Nightbreed does have its fair share of sound and fury, not to mention blood and entrails. But it plays as if Barker were making it up as he went along, despite the film's having been based on his own novel Cabal."
Battle for the Planet of the Apes,5.5,8800000,50,"Battle looks like the last gap of a dying series, a movie made simply to wring the dollars out of any remaining ape fans."
Battle for the Planet of the Apes,5.5,8800000,42,It’s hard to get the same feeling of awe and epic scale that the series’ best installments can offer when you’re essentially watching ten guys squabble in a forest.
Battle for the Planet of the Apes,5.5,8800000,42,"The bloodiest of the Apes films, and one of the most despairing."
Battle for the Planet of the Apes,5.5,8800000,40,"Largely devoid of any charm or intelligence that made other Apes films entertaining, this one should be buried in the Forbidden Zone."
Battle for the Planet of the Apes,5.5,8800000,40,"Episode number five of the APES series, is the last and least of the bunch, with a juvenile script and parsimonious production values more befitting the various APES merchandising tie-ins (including toys, comic books, and action figures) than the fourth sequel to one of the finest science-fiction films in history."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,90,"Mad Max has always radiated an otherworldly vibe, a slightly sickly sensation that something at its core is fundamentally wrong."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,90,"Miller's work has been compared to Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, but where the Leone films are about amorality, the Mad Max movies are purely and simply amoral—some of the most determinedly formalist filmmaking this side of Michael Snow."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,90,"Simple, but effective."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,80,"With his instinct and craft, Miller has provided more autosuggestive violence on a $1 million budget than The Blues Brothers did with half the Chicago police force and $30 million."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,80,"The tone sometimes wavers into self-parody, and there are occasional crude patches, but overall this edge-of-seat revenge movie marks the most exciting debut from an Australian director since Peter Weir."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,80,"It's pretty much assumed throughout art and literature that the collapse of civilization will result in the rise of barbarism. That assumption underlies Mad Max, where the strong prey on the weak, and Max steps in to be the equalizer."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,75,"Though the plot is that of a simple revenge western, director George Miller infuses the film with a kinetic combination of visual style, amazing stunt work, creative costume design, and eccentric, detailed characterizations that practically jump out of the screen and grab the viewer by the throat."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,75,"The film belongs to the director, cameraman and stunt artists: it’s not an actor’s piece, though the leads are all effective."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,75,"Less pretentious and more gripping than the overrated sequel, ''The Road Warrior,'' but viciously violent and awfully shallow."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,70,"The chase scenes are top notch. Unfortunately, the movie has a lot of slow parts as well. Another bizarre aspect of Mad Max is that the voices were re-dubbed. Director George Miller, decided that the American public wouldn't be able to understand the Australian accents. It's not as bad as it sounds, but it's definitely a noticeable annoyance."
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,60,"Neither the best nor the worst of movies derived from videogames, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li at least gives action fans plenty to ogle besides the titular heroine (Kristin Kreuk), whose original incarnation, legend has it, was among the first distaff figures controllable by joystick."
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,60,"Reveling in the vivid Bangkok locations, Geoff Boyle’s photography is crisp and bright, and Dion Lam’s action choreography unusually witty."
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,30,"Director Andrzej Bartkowiak (""Romeo Must Die"") works hard to supply the appropriate grittiness, but other than a few reasonably well-staged fight sequences, the proceedings are dull and visually uninspired. Justin Marks' solemn screenplay lacks any trace of wit."
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,30,A wholly inept action experience that works at boring us to tears.
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,25,"There's something special about this underwhelming mess of a Street Fighter reboot that many cinematic cheese-lovers will find very appetizing. The fact is that The Legend of Chun-Li is not at all a good flick, but it's filled with so much cornball ineptitude that one would think some rather broken mad movie genius was behind it."
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,25,"This is a movie for the overcaffeinated, undereducated teenager in all of us."
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,20,Idiot plotting and dialogue are what you'd expect from a genre that typically rewards narrative development with a skip function. But the rote fight scenes are a disappointment.
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,20,"Even with the low expectations The Legend of Chun Li engenders, it still somehow manages to be a letdown."
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,16,Don't be fooled by the low grade: This sequel-in-spirit to Jean-Claude Van Damme's 1994 dud doesn't even succeed in being memorably bad.
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,0,"The problems with Street Fighter: The Legend Of Chun-Li began with the casting of dead-eyed, sleepy-voiced, charisma-impaired automaton Kristin Kreuk."
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,0,It boggles the mind that The Legend of Chun-Li is as vapid and dull as it is.
The Omega Man,6.6,8720000,75,"If nothing else, The Omega Man remains worth seeing for its remarkable shots of Heston wandering through an abandoned metropolis."
The Omega Man,6.6,8720000,70,"The Omega Man is an extremely literate science-fiction drama starring Charlton Heston as the only survivor of a worldwide bacteriological war, circa 1975. Thrust of the well-written story [adapted from Richard Matheson's novel] is Heston's running battle with deranged survivors headed by Anthony Zerbe."
The Omega Man,6.6,8720000,63,"Not bad, but far from a classic."
The Omega Man,6.6,8720000,60,"It's not the plot that disappoints, it's the poor dialogue between action sequences. Sadly another film to file under not as good as the book."
The Omega Man,6.6,8720000,50,"The ghouls are a little too ridiculous to quite fulfill their function in the movie. They make all the wrong decisions, are incompetent and ill-coordinated."
The Omega Man,6.6,8720000,50,"Peppered with some sharp, even amusing dialogue, the story temporarily shelves the heavy allegory and slips into good, slam-bang suspense. But it doesn't last."
The Omega Man,6.6,8720000,50,"Badly dated and clumsily allegorical, The Omega Man has some fairly interesting moments, the most memorable being the view of a devastated, empty downtown Los Angeles."
The Bounty,7.1,8600000,100,"The Bounty is a great adventure, a lush romance, and a good movie."
The Bounty,7.1,8600000,88,"The Bounty is an intelligent, firstrate, revisionist telling of the famous tale of Fletcher Christian's mutiny against Captain Bligh. Particularly distinguished by a sensational, and startlingly human, performance by Anthony Hopkins as Bligh, heretofore one of history's most one-dimensional villains."
The Bounty,7.1,8600000,80,"The Bounty has an incredible cast and a fabulously well-put-together production, and pays impressive attention to historical accuracy – more than any of the previous cinematic recreations. With all this going for it, it's a pity that the drama falls flat."
The Bounty,7.1,8600000,63,"Film is elegant but never beautiful, a pretence at Lean’s magnificence contradicted by a lavish but anachronistic score by Vangelis. It is the words and performances which excite; their director is out of his depth."
The Bounty,7.1,8600000,60,"It's all a brave try, though Gibson is perhaps not up to the demands of a Christian's progress from naive rating to self-loathing exile, and Donaldson's direction often verges on the stolid."
The Bounty,7.1,8600000,60,"The movie seems to have been planned, written, acted, shot and edited by people who were constantly being overruled by other people. It's totally lifeless."
Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie,3.6,8363899,60,"Has lots of energy and a sensational villainess, Divatox (Hilary Shepard Turner), whose fashion tips come from Ming the Merciless and who has been given all the film's sharpest lines."
Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie,3.6,8363899,50,"With minimalist and universal fantasies as their points of departure, the superheroic deeds evolve only incrementally beyond the realistic -- a deeply satisfying process."
Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie,3.6,8363899,40,"Infantile, pointless tedium aimed at kids, to whom the fact that it features the entire cast of TV's Power Rangers ZEO will presumably mean something."
Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie,3.6,8363899,40,"Even under the best of circumstances, it would be late in the day for another bigscreen adventure from the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. But coming so soon after the well-received reissue of George Lucas' Star Wars trilogy, the high-camp cheesiness ofTurbo: A Power Rangers Movie is especially unimpressive."
Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie,3.6,8363899,40,"For me, that low-tech, Fifties, camp charm wore a mite thin by the second half-hour, but then, I'm not the target audience, am I?"

Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie,3.6,8363899,30,Five-year-olds who have read their Shakespeare will recognize that Turbo is a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.
Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie,3.6,8363899,25,"Every instance when Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie feels like the worst movie ever made, some goofy little screechy moment involving the villainess, Divatox, saves it. So it winds up being nearly the worst movie ever made."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,75,"Like the incompetent spy himself, this is a comedy that will sneak up on the skeptical and defy low expectations, producing something smart enough to neatly balance the thrills and the yuks."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,75,"The laughs, including the big laughs, keep coming right up to the closing seconds."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,63,"It's breezy stuff, to be sure. And while English is far from becoming the Pink Panther for the Facebook generation, Atkinson has a breezy rapport with junior Agent Tucker (Daniel Kaluuya) that's reminiscent of Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau and his relationship with sidekick Kato."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,60,The mix of groin injury and over-explanation could totally reach 9-year-olds and a greying Atkinson is still relentlessly lovable.
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,60,"As the movie glides along, it may not elicit explosive laughter, but it plants a steady smile on your face and doesn't leave you feeling molested. If that's another way of saying Johnny English Reborn is old-fashioned, so be it."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,60,"All that matters with efforts like this is whether the cookie-cutter plotting serves up enough situations for Atkinson to contort himself into and out of jams. After all, are the narratives what you remember from the ""Pink Panther"" movies? Or the silly things, like that Clouseau could so easily get his finger caught in a spinning globe?"
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,60,"Johnny English Reborn never quite ignites, even though it starts out promisingly enough."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,60,"More a resuscitation than a rebirth, Johnny English Reborn finds British comedian Rowan Atkinson reviving his spoof spy character with this enjoyable if somewhat wheezy reprise."

Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,50,"Johnny English Reborn sounds like a reboot, but it's actually a tired recycling of something that wasn't exactly fresh to begin with."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,40,Even the most desperately deprived secret-agent devotee will find little to cheer in this yawn-tastic 007 send-up.
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,38,"""English Reborn"" isn't terrible and is certainly seriously harmless."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,38,"For anyone expecting the second coming of Clouseau, Johnny English Reborn is a karmic catastrophe."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,38,"I spent most of Johnny English wondering whom the filmmakers were targeting. While childish and silly, it's far too violent for young kids."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,38,"After a fast, funny start, the new sequel, Johnny English Reborn, proves to be more of the same."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,38,"As ticklish as one might find the idea of an equivalent Mr. Bean character occupying the driver's seat of a James Bond parody, it's likely that even a competent manifestation of such a scenario would pale in comparison to what Mike Myers and Jay Roach pulled off with apparent ease in their Austin Powers films."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,30,"Atkinson's fans are likely to rejoice as the comedian twists his face and body to and fro, but the rest of us will not be recruited."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,20,"An incredible physical comedian, Rowan Atkinson would seemingly do anything for a laugh except one crucial thing: hold out for a better script. This sequel to 2003's Johnny English has a few inspired gags, but most of the material is on the level of English getting kicked repeatedly in his thunderballs."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,20,"It must be said that everyone - including Dominic West and Rosamund Pike -- works awfully hard to entertain us. But that just makes it all the more depressing when joke after joke falls painfully flat. Stay home and introduce your kids to Mr. Bean, instead."
Blue Steel,5.7,8220000,75,"The plot is a little of Fatal Attraction, a little of Jagged Edge and a little of Wall Street. It works because it's so audacious in combining elements that don't seem to belong together."
Blue Steel,5.7,8220000,75,"Blue Steel's greatest pleasure is its smashing cinematography, courtesy of Amir Mokri, but also owing much to Bigelow's distinctive pop aesthetics. The dependable Curtis adds depth to what might have been a stock character; Silver is convincingly vicious and seductive."
Blue Steel,5.7,8220000,75,"Short on plausibility but preserving the psycho-sexual ambiguities throughout, Bigelow's seductively stylish, wildy fetishistic thriller is proof that a woman can enter a traditionally male world and, like Megan, beat men at their own game."
Blue Steel,5.7,8220000,75,"A taut, relentless thriller that hums with an electric current of outrage. Director and cowriter Kathryn Bigelow makes the most of her hook - the use of a female star (Jamie Lee Curtis) in a tough action pic - by stressing the character's vulnerability in remarkable early scenes."
Blue Steel,5.7,8220000,70,"Blue Steel lacks sustained storytelling craftsmanship, and it never approaches the saturnine intensity of the film it sometimes recalls, Michael Mann’s Manhunter (the greatest thriller of the past decade). But it makes you eager to see what Bigelow could do with a good script."
Blue Steel,5.7,8220000,70,"It isn't necessary to believe Blue Steel fully to find it gripping all the way through, and to be both fascinated and frightened by its icy, gleaming vision of urban life. For the audience, it's both a sobering and invigorating experience. For Ms. Bigelow, it's a breakthrough."
Blue Steel,5.7,8220000,67,"What starts out as a moody arthouse flick rapidly becomes an uneven B-movie yukfest (sometimes intentional, sometimes not), with low-budget concessions to the Hollywood cop-versus-killer industry."
Blue Steel,5.7,8220000,63,"Unfortunately, style needs a little substance to keep it from careening around looking empty, and the story of Blue Steel is lofty, implausible twaddle that sinks whatever ideas Bigelow hoped to investigate."
Blue Steel,5.7,8220000,60,"Blue Steel is a mean and unsavory celebration of misplaced misogyny milked for dollars, a mindless soup of urban neurosis and sexual loathing. It's a case of slam, bam, no thankee ma'am."
Blue Steel,5.7,8220000,60,Somewhat dated now but still occasionally gripping.
Blue Steel,5.7,8220000,50,"The sole curiosity in Blue Steel is the sight of Jamie Lee Curtis in cop`s uniform. There is nothing more to it than that-no tension, no character."
Streets of Fire,6.8,8089290,88,"Walter Hill’s 1984 film combines everything from seedy bars, street fights, motorcycles, beefy heavies, and tough dames in a smorgasbord of tawdry, moral-flouting clichés that distills decades of imagery that represents youth in cinema."
Streets of Fire,6.8,8089290,80,"The message is that there is no message; if this isn't action cinema in its purest form, then it's pretty close."
Streets of Fire,6.8,8089290,80,"Streets of Fire is fairly devoid of anything resembling a cohesive plot or lacking even a shred of subtext. It exists purely as pop action cinema, sweeping you up with a fevered enthusiasm and an overpowering desire to entertain which proves incredibly difficult to resist."
Streets of Fire,6.8,8089290,75,"Walter Hill's Streets of Fire begins by telling us it's a rock & roll fable ... from another time, another place. The movie is right on the rock & roll, but the alternative time and place are mysteriously convincing -- especially if, like me, you believe the most beautiful post-war American cars were Studebakers."
Streets of Fire,6.8,8089290,70,"Its subtitle, A Rock & Roll Fable, contains all the elements Hill looked for in a movie as a teenager in the late 50s, and in 94 minutes it manages to be an urban western, a backstage rock musical and a biker flick set in an unidentified, run-down rust-belt inner city that might be yesterday or tomorrow."
Streets of Fire,6.8,8089290,70,"A pulsing, throbbing orchestration careening around the rescue of a kidnapped young singer. The decor is urban squalor."
Streets of Fire,6.8,8089290,63,Very of its time but enjoyable for all that.
Streets of Fire,6.8,8089290,63,"For all its studied sultriness, the movie feels unsexy, perhaps because its inspiration is the kind of hard- hearted western that concentrates on manly combat while eschewing all sentiment."
Streets of Fire,6.8,8089290,60,Vallone's production design is a knockout--the film is weakly scripted and scored.
Dhoom:3,5.4,8031955,88,Dhoom: 3 has — by far — the best action set pieces of the series.
Dhoom:3,5.4,8031955,75,"Dhoom:3 entertains as a spectacle of chases, bank capers, magic acts and song-and-dance numbers."
Dhoom:3,5.4,8031955,60,"At their best, the lush yet punchy musical numbers that Acharya stages for Dhoom: 3 reach giddy heights of pop romanticism."
Dhoom:3,5.4,8031955,50,“Dhoom 3” is very much the Aamir Khan show.
Death Race 2000,6.2,8000000,91,"It’s all ridiculous and occasionally surreal, but Bartel never loses sight of the unpleasantness; when these cartoons explode, they don’t get to place any more orders with the Acme company. They just die."
Death Race 2000,6.2,8000000,90,"As a genre picture, and as a nugget of pure unadulterated cult entertainment, Death Race 2000 is one of the best around."
Death Race 2000,6.2,8000000,80,"A distinctively crass, hugely enjoyable sick satire from director Paul Bartel, working for uber-producer Roger Corman – allegedly, Bartel kept thinking up more and wilder jokes, while Corman insisted more and more people got run over."
Death Race 2000,6.2,8000000,80,"The All-American imagery, coexisting with occasional shots of swastikas and socially-sanctioned cruelty, give it the feel of a surreal, funny fever dream about national purpose gone horribly awry."
Death Race 2000,6.2,8000000,75,Fine work carved from minimal materials.
Death Race 2000,6.2,8000000,70,"Script, from an Ib Melchior story, makes its satirical points economically, and director Paul Bartel keeps the film moving quickly."
Death Race 2000,6.2,8000000,70,"Death Race 2000 isn’t the sharp satire Corman thinks it is, but it’s fun."
Death Race 2000,6.2,8000000,67,Death Race is a maladroit but exuberantly gamey mix of social commentary and blue-collar goofiness.
Death Race 2000,6.2,8000000,63,"Overall the movie isn't as synchromeshed as it might be; the rivalry between champions Carradine and Stallone isn't very interesting, and some of the gags aren't sick or funny enough. But it's a great audience film."
Death Race 2000,6.2,8000000,60,Superior drive-in exploitation fare.
Death Race 2000,6.2,8000000,60,"In the end, it reveals itself to have nothing to say beyond the superficial about government or rebellion. And in the absence of such a statement, it becomes what it seems to have mocked—a spectacle glorifying the car is an instrument of violence."
Death Race 2000,6.2,8000000,50,I was torn between walking out immediately and staying to witness a spectacle more dismaying than anything on the screen: the way small children were digging gratuitous bloodshed.
Runaway Train,7.3,7936012,100,Runaway Train is a reminder that the great adventures are great because they happen to people we care about.
Runaway Train,7.3,7936012,88,Runaway Train belongs to a rare genre: the intelligent thriller.
Runaway Train,7.3,7936012,80,"The true winning formula, however, is found in Voight and Roberts’ double-act. Their eccentric characters are funny, violent and heartwarming all at the same time, where we root for them despite the fact that they’re basically psychopaths."
Runaway Train,7.3,7936012,75,The action in this superlative film is relentless and gripping from beginning to end.
Runaway Train,7.3,7936012,70,"Somehow one leaves aside the blatant implausibilities, the coincidences, even Eric Roberts, and takes great pleasure in a breakneck ride to the end of the line. And Voight has finally found his niche, abandoning all those wet-eyed liberal roles and playing to the hilt a hideous, raving beast, with scars. Great ending, too."
Runaway Train,7.3,7936012,63,"Although the film isn't an empty picture, it is too much of a good thing. Voight delivers a wonderful speech to Roberts about survival, but it's only one of many such monologues. Similarly, Roberts is tiring in his frantic reactions."
Runaway Train,7.3,7936012,63,"What is well worth watching here, much more so than the train itself, is Jon Voight, who gives a fiery performance in an unusually hard-edged role."
Strange Days,7.2,7919000,100,This is the first movie about virtual reality to deal in a challenging way with the implications of the technology. It's fascinating the way Bigelow is able to suggest so much of VR's impact (and dangers) within a movie - a form of VR that's a century old.
Strange Days,7.2,7919000,100,"Undeniably thrilling and troubling...Dazzling, era-defining."
Strange Days,7.2,7919000,100,Fascinating.
Strange Days,7.2,7919000,90,"Flawed, but often brilliant, provocative film-making."
Strange Days,7.2,7919000,90,"Strange Days is a thriller first and a mystery second. It's big, explosive entertainment and, although not directed by Cameron, is very much in the vein we've come to expect from him. Strange Days may not be the best movie to hit screens during the Fall, but it's likely to be the brashest."
Strange Days,7.2,7919000,88,"From the visceral plunges of the first person mind clip sequences (including a terrifying, controversy courting rape sequence) to the overwhelming finale this is a, literally, stunning event. Some directors can, thank God, still make you experience films."
Strange Days,7.2,7919000,88,"A technical tour de force for director Kathryn Bigelow and her team, pic is less accomplished in putting over its characters, emotions and dubious sociopolitical agenda."
Strange Days,7.2,7919000,88,Only when it comes time to justify its excesses and deliver on a promise of wider revelation does the otherwise audacious screenplay by James Cameron and Jay Cocks look too specific and small.
Strange Days,7.2,7919000,88,"I wasn't bored at all by this, and Angela Bassett's action-hero charisma often blew me away, but fans of Bigelow at her best (e.g., Near Dark) may be put off by the movie's calculation, which doesn't always fit with its intellectual pretensions."
Strange Days,7.2,7919000,80,"If anything, Strange Days belongs to the rotters hovering around its edges: Michael Wincott, a vision of Drano-throated malevolence; Tom Sizemore, who, as Lenny’s bikerish pal, suggests Judd Nelson if he’d let the corruption ooze a little further out of his pores; and the wonderfully weaselly Richard Edson as an underground software techie."
Strange Days,7.2,7919000,70,"Although there are some exhilarating moments here, they're offset by frequent distractions: Lewis' standard (and now boring) weird performance, an occasional lack of logic in the story line, a tendency to go operatic, and the overall feeling that the movie is unsure of where it is going."
Strange Days,7.2,7919000,70,"Strange Days is an ambitious but ultimately disappointing attempt to assemble the latest in fringe-culture byproducts - distortion-laden torch songs, millenarian fantasies and cyberpunk nightmares - into a Hollywood package. Its failures are those of limited imagination; its brands of strangeness, like the clips its characters replay, never stray far from the familiar landscapes of 1995 pop culture."
Strange Days,7.2,7919000,70,"It hurts to see this story reach for a tidy ending... STRANGE DAYS hurtles down the track for two hours, frantically trying to warn us en route to the Big Switchback, only to pull up in a hiss of smoke and hot air."
Strange Days,7.2,7919000,67,"Strange Days wants to say something about faith and redemption -- about the importance of maintaining one's humanity in a darkened world. That's a worthy intent, but Bigelow is so enamored of high-tech thrills, and so mesmerized by the violence she seeks to condemn, that her efforts at 11th-hour moralizing seem limp and halfhearted."
Strange Days,7.2,7919000,67,"A film that's prescient and mind-bogglingly ill-conceived in roughly equal measures...Strange Days is the cinematic equivalent of trip-hop, a shadowy realm of atmosphere, mood and suggestion with a decidedly drugged-up, post-apocalyptic feel. But the many things Strange Days gets right are negated by the things it gets wrong."
Strange Days,7.2,7919000,67,"Days is loaded with effective visual razzmatazz, but what the eyes giveth, the ears taketh away. For whether it's the plot, the dialogue, the character development or the acting itself, anything that stands apart from camera style is a thudding disappointment."
Vampire Academy,5.5,7791979,70,"For smart, strong girls and the guys who like them, Vampire Academy will hit a vein."
Vampire Academy,5.5,7791979,60,"The supernatural fight scenes are cheesy and cheap, but this movie is less about epic brawls and more about a headmistress in fabulous dresses, secret meetings with brooding boys in the library, sexualized fang pokes and making wisenheimer comments during prophetic visions."
Vampire Academy,5.5,7791979,58,"Well-directed and fun, if not a bit too long and perhaps concerned with a plot that’s not nearly as engaging as its leads, Vampire Academy is a little smarter than your average teen adventure, but it’s certainly not Heathers or Mean Girls."
Vampire Academy,5.5,7791979,50,"What is surprising is that while the patchwork whole creaks terribly in places, the parts also show signs of life."
Vampire Academy,5.5,7791979,50,"If you're not at the bull's-eye center of the target audience, a movie like this one can suck the life out of you."
Vampire Academy,5.5,7791979,50,"Tedious as all this vampire exposition is (and there’s a LOT), the jokey tone here is much appreciated, with everyone “a few corpuscles shy of an artery” and the action as predictable as “a porcupine in a hot tub.”"
Vampire Academy,5.5,7791979,40,"It’s not a complete disaster, but even the appearance of Gabriel Byrne, as Lissa’s uncle Victor, fails to make much of a dent in the slapdash proceedings."
Vampire Academy,5.5,7791979,40,"Fans of the books might enjoy seeing their world brought to life, but most everyone else will likely leave feeling as if they’ve just completed a seminar on vampire lore, and they’re likely to fail any pop quiz that follows."
Vampire Academy,5.5,7791979,30,"The film is based on a popular series of young-adult books (big surprise), but one figures only die-hard fans will enjoy the result. The movie is slow-witted and moves at a glacial pace."
Vampire Academy,5.5,7791979,30,A film as soul-sucking as any of the fang-baring bores who populate it.
Vampire Academy,5.5,7791979,25,"Despite such attractions as Gabriel Byrne as a vampire with a skin disease and a décor that combines Hogwarts with “Suspiria,” the only lesson learned here is that Hollywood needs fresh blood."
Vampire Academy,5.5,7791979,25,Vampire Academy is toothless in both substance and style.
Vampire Academy,5.5,7791979,25,The only thing that distinguishes this teen-magnet wannabe from its predecessors is how lazily it appears to have been slapped together.
Vampire Academy,5.5,7791979,20,"Mead’s six Vampire Academy books (there’s also an ongoing spinoff series, “Bloodlines”) are relatively brainy and complex within their young-adult subgenre, but their virtues have been reduced to a derivative hash here."
Vampire Academy,5.5,7791979,0,"One idea, mixed with lame jokes, and stretched beyond coherence. Vampire Academy doesn't need a review. It needs a stake in the heart."
Maximum Overdrive,5.4,7433663,50,"Maximum Overdrive offers a variation on what has become a hopelessly hackneyed theme -- technology as monster. As long as King is tinkering with his crazed machines, the film sustains a certain amount of ominous tension, but as soon as the author turns his attention to his actors, the movie's slender storyline goes limp. It's dreary to the max."
Maximum Overdrive,5.4,7433663,40,"A loud, obnoxious, single-idea schlocker...There's carnage galore, but minimal interest. King himself described it as a 'wonderful moron picture', and he was half-right."
Maximum Overdrive,5.4,7433663,30,"Master manipulator Stephen King, making his directoral debut from his own script, fails to create a convincing enough environment to make the kind of nonsense he's offering here believable or fun."
Maximum Overdrive,5.4,7433663,30,"For the most part, [King] has taken a promising notion - our dependence on our machines - and turned it into one long car-crunch movie, wheezing from setups to crackups."
Maximum Overdrive,5.4,7433663,30,"MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE doesn't work on any level. As a comedy it's obvious and asinine, as a horror film it's simply not scary, and as an action film it's a bore."
Phantasm II,6.5,7282851,75,"Coscarelli has captured the texture of a disjointed, half-remembered nightmare, full of figures and events that seem to have some symbolic value, but which have lost their precise meaning in the process of floating up from the subconscious."
Phantasm II,6.5,7282851,60,"The difference between the ""Phantasms"" is the difference between ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""2010."" Coscarelli's sequel is a fast, entertaining fright show, but it's not inspired in the way the original was."
Phantasm II,6.5,7282851,50,"There are some grotesquely stylish and scary moments in Phantasm II, the sequel to a 1979 film that Don Coscarelli made as a precocious 25-year-old. Unfortunately, these episdoes seem to take as long to arrive as the sequel did."
Phantasm II,6.5,7282851,40,"The original Phantasm was an inventive fever-dream, but the sequel, unfortunately, lacks that delirious youthful imagination. There are some memorable moments along the way--fleeting images scattered throughout the film that have a cumulative effect--but when the shocks do come, they are mostly retreads of highlights from the first movie."
Phantasm II,6.5,7282851,38,"The target audience for Phantasm II obviously is teenagers, especially those with abbreviated attention spans, who require a thrill a minute. No character development, logic or subtlety is necessary, just a sensation every now and again to provide the impression that something is happening on the screen."
Red Sonja,5.1,6948633,80,"It's a great-looking film, filled with wildly imaginative sets and costumes that would have done the Maestro proud, and veteran director Richard Fleischer (The Vikings) rises to the occasion with some sharply staged action scenes. With Nielsen's minimal English rubbing up against the fractured locutions of costar Arnold Schwarzenegger, the dialogue passages don't exactly play like Noel Coward, but this is a movie that succeeds rousingly well on its own humble, Saturday-night terms."
Red Sonja,5.1,6948633,50,Red Sonja [based on stories by Robert E. Howard] returns to those olden days when women were women and the menfolk stood around with funny hats on until called forth to be whacked at.
Red Sonja,5.1,6948633,30,"Worst of all, there's a charmless brat prince for Sonja to take under her wing. Pap, and Fleischer - who at least brought a touch of humour to Conan the Destroyer - should know better."
Red Sonja,5.1,6948633,25,"Sure, there are a few funny moments here and there with several obviously intended jokes, but director Richard Fleischer never milks the elements of self-parody for what they're worth."
Red Sonja,5.1,6948633,25,"This is going to be more of a consumer warning than a traditional film review, because Red Sonja is like a can of dog food covered by a label featuring a picture of a sirloin steak."
Red Sonja,5.1,6948633,20,"Mr. Fleischer brings absolutely no playfulness to what might, at least, have been enjoyably light. And he brings out the worst in a cast that was ill-chosen to begin with. The most memorable thing about the film is the costume/production design by Danilo Donati, which is genuinely demented. Even the horses wear too much junk jewelry."
Death Wish 4: The Crackdown,5.4,6880310,60,What raises Death Wish 4 above the usual blowout is a semi-engaging script and sure pacing by veteran action director J. Lee Thompson.
Death Wish 4: The Crackdown,5.4,6880310,60,"Gail Morgan Hickman's complicated script manages a couple of nice twists, but it's too formulary to pursue the ambiguities it reveals. Most enjoyable is the clear thread of self-parody, which keeps the laughs and bullets coming thick and fast."
Death Wish 4: The Crackdown,5.4,6880310,60,"Death Wish 4 may be preposterous, but on the level of technique it's a solid textbook example of crisp exploitation picture craftsmanship. Thompson clearly takes pleasure in setting up every scene with maximum economy and impact, and his work is that of a professional without apologies."
Death Wish 4: The Crackdown,5.4,6880310,50,"Death Wish 4 is as efficient and predictable as Kersey himself, and inoffensive as long as you can root for a sociopathic hero."
Death Wish 4: The Crackdown,5.4,6880310,25,"No one was exactly clamoring for this one, and Bronson has vowed it will be the last Death Wish."
Death Wish 4: The Crackdown,5.4,6880310,25,"This time around, there's barely any plot, just excuses for Bronson to blow people away."
Runaway,5.9,6770587,70,"Runaway doesn't stint on the gizmos, and its inventiveness in that respect is its best feature; it comes up with, among other things, foot-long metallic spiders with a deadly sting and heat-seeking bullets that can be programmed to track specific human targets."
Runaway,5.9,6770587,70,"This near-future tale, in which Selleck heads a police division tracking murderous machines, is technically quite as accomplished as Crichton's previous work, carrying a strong atmosphere of menace and some virtuoso effects (including a tracking shot behind a bullet that makes the Bond movies seem old-fashioned). But once it turns from the hardware and the action to people, you can hardly believe your eyes or your ears."
Runaway,5.9,6770587,63,"The problem with RUNAWAY is that it never reaches deeper than a playful level, amounting to nothing more than great but shallow entertainment. Selleck provides a thoughtful performance, coming across as a real, feeling person instead of the expected Rambo-esque tough-guy stereotype."
Runaway,5.9,6770587,50,"This Michael Crichton robotic nightmare is so trite that the story seems lifted from Marvel Comics, with heat-seeking bullets and a villain so bad he would be fun if the film wasn’t telling us to take this near-futuristic adventure with a straight face."
Runaway,5.9,6770587,50,"Starts with savvy concepts (televised mind control and man’s reliance on robots, respectively) and quickly devolves into sour, overwritten diatribes."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,100,"As a first-time director, Pearce manages something difficult. He creates a tone that acknowledges absurdity, but also consequences. He finds an edge that’s extreme, that’s weird, that’s satirical and that goes right to the edge of farce, and yet the movie is at all points as involving as an intense drama."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,89,"This is one of the major delights of Hotel Artemis: a plot that posits a damaged, Medicare-aged woman as its central figure. And that the role is executed by a two-time Oscar-winning actress delivering her best work in many years makes this a rare treat."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,80,"Hotel Artemis is a bold, loud, ambitious film, far cleverer than the bog-standard summer blockbuster fare, and with sharp humour and driving suspense it makes this pulpy-sci fi thriller a very fun watch."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,80,"Stylishly realised against a backdrop of violence and faded Hollywood glamour, Drew Pearce’s vision of the near-future is laced with intrigue and dark humour."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,75,"While originality may not exactly be in great supply here, these familiar elements have been mixed with enough wit and style to make for some sleazy, insanely violent, and reasonably entertaining B-movie trash."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,75,"High-concept, low-budget, proudly set-bound, Hotel Artemis shouldn’t work at all. Somehow, miraculously, it does."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,75,"Hotel Artemis is neither a sequel nor a remake, but a film of considerable originality. And that makes it a rarity at the multiplex."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,75,"It’s essentially the Hotel Earle from “Barton Fink,” augmented by the latest in robotic surgical techniques for bullet extraction."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,75,"Writer-director Drew Pearce must have done something right to get a cast like this to sign on for what is essentially a loving, highly stylized homage to the kind of camp apocalyptia John Carpenter used to make; the only thing missing here is an Ernest Borgnine cameo and Kurt Russell scowling in an eye patch."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,71,"It’s a stylish and amusing thriller, but a hollow one, with mostly broad-stroke characters populating an otherwise ultra-detailed fictional criminal underworld. Fans of crime movies like John Wick will be entertained by the big ideas and backstories, but they probably won’t form the kind of connection they have to other, better films of its ilk."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,67,"For roughly its first half, Hotel Artemis glides nicely on all of Pearce’s world-building and the cast’s confident performances. But as the power flickers at the Artemis and dangerous foes close in, the movie starts to wobble. Pearce has maybe put too many variables in play and has trouble connecting them into a unified narrative."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,67,"We’ve seen it all before in movies and video games, but the packaging is slick and hard to resist; any sci-fi crime movie with moody camerawork by Chung Chung-hoon, a Cliff Martinez score, a cast this strange, and an original end-credits ballad by Father John Misty (also a cast member) is begging to be watched, regardless of actual content or the messiness of the action scenes."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,67,"Drew Pearce‘s Hotel Artemis...falls victim to much of what ails any ensemble picture — rushed plotting, forced coincidence, indulgence — but still manages to make a big impression."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,63,The humor is often muted and at times almost apologetic and a subplot involving long-ago events fails in its goal of boosting the three-dimensionality of a character.
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,63,"There are a lot of moving parts here, and Pearce fits them together with admirable skill. Originality isn’t his strong suit, but “Artemis” has enough snaky twists and turns and moody energy to make it a fun ride."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,60,"Ultimately, in all its artifice and haphazard but enthusiastic invention, Hotel Artemis makes me a bit nostalgic for French ’90s genre fare of Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro and, of course, Luc Besson, embracing their daffiness and dreaminess with an somewhat counterintuitive, almost naïve lack of vanity."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,60,"This isn't a movie that pretends to be profound. It's meant purely as B-movie entertainment, and -- also like the ""John Wick"" films -- it's fully aware of that."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,60,"The wannabe thriller set in the near future packs gritty style and ambiance, but that’s no match when the story has no stakes and doesn’t add up."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,60,"The flavorful cast inhabit vividly drawn characters, and, perhaps most of all, the film exudes wall-to-wall, high-grunge atmosphere. That’s a lot of checked-off boxes, and yet the effect is efficiently wild rather than wildly involving, entertaining but not indelible."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,60,"For all of its faults, there’s still plenty here to praise, the result of so much being thrown at the wall is that some of it will stick. Pearce has a sharp creative flair and a head full of ideas but he feels somewhat hemmed in by the constraints of a short running time and a high profile release date."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,60,"Mr. Pearce is also well-versed in staging and shooting decent action scenes, and building suspense enough to keep Hotel Artemis diverting in its overstuffed ambition. Add to that Ms. Foster’s welcome return to big-screen acting after a five-year layoff and you’ve got a movie almost worth seeing."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,58,"Despite the ingredients at hand, Pearce and company never really pull it together in a manner that realizes the potential. The result is a pulp buffet that feels like it should have been a gourmet meal—a Golden Corral of genre conventions (that leaves the audience feeling about as satisfied)."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,50,"Positive points to the Hotel Artemis for trying to achieve something original, and for the quality of the cast. But after that bloody boldness, the analogies and the life lessons and the moments of closure are all too predictable and familiar."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,50,"It boasts snappy dialogue, memorable characters, and a gorgeously designed central location but doesn’t quite know what to do with any of the above."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,50,"Writer-director Drew Pearce’s Hotel Artemis, however, manages to make the most intriguingly bonkers premise a boring and flat exercise."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,50,"Writer and director Drew Pearce makes his feature debut in a confused, jumbled film that never quite gets its story straight."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,50,"There’s nothing especially striking about the movie’s visual presentation – the Artemis is threadbare and creaky, a purposely anachronistic blend of the future tech and throwback furnishings. The actions is competent, the performers game."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,50,Too many subplots make the story feel cluttered and no more intelligent.
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,50,"Like many movies set in colourfully bleak futures, Hotel Artemis can’t sustain the novelty of its initial world-building."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,50,"Whether it’s the too-harried pacing or too many central people vying for attention, the film’s heart never quite coalesces. Seizing it is like trying to grab a cloud. Pearce seems to want this movie to be both a neon pulp plot-heavy piece and a character-driven drama, and there’s just not enough time in a single film for all of it to work."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,45,Though it boasts an agreeably preposterous scenario and a weird mixed bag of physicalities and acting styles — from Foster and Sterling K. Brown to Jenny Slate and Dave Bautista — the movie is itself an eye-rolling performance of cyber-pulp tropes and pop-movie excesses that undercuts its spotty pleasures at nearly every turn.
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,42,"A handful of amusing details in desperate need of a purpose, the film spends its first half looking for a compelling reason to exist, and its second half trying to disguise the fact that it can’t find one."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,38,Writer-director Drew Pearce has tarted up a dullish action comedy that finds laughs hard to come by and its moral underpinnings shaky.
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,38,Hotel Artemis quickly reveals its future setting as an empty pretext for a banally convoluted and sentimentalized show of emotional rehabilitation.
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,25,"Writer and director Drew Pearce has made an uneven feature film directorial debut. He flaps around for a consistent tone, stunts some potential story lines and kicks out a bunch of cliches. Then, clearly unable to find a rational way to end his film, he adds two massive doses of nonsensical ultra-violence."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,0,"Moronic drivel that truly qualifies as the worst movie of the year, it sinks amateurish moviemaking aimed at audiences with no taste to an alarming new low."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,100,"The Grandmaster is, at its most persuasive, about the triumph of style. When Ip Man slyly asks “What’s your style?” it’s clear that Mr. Wong is asking the same question because here, as in his other films, style isn’t reducible to ravishing surfaces; it’s an expression of meaning."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,90,"In short, I'd be the happiest person in the world if Wong announced there was a four-hour cut of this film somewhere. For now, neither version is perfect, but they’re both so beautiful, so heartbreaking, that the question may be moot. Whatever its flaws, seeing The Grandmaster theatrically, in any version, should be a sacrament for any true film lover — a spiritual duty."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,90,"An exercise in pure cinematic style filled with the most ravishing images, The Grandmaster finds director Wong Kar-wai applying his impeccable visual style to the mass-market martial arts genre with potent results."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,90,"The Grandmaster, may well be the definitive illustration of kung fu in all its arcane schools and intricate styles. There's never been anything like it — a seemingly endless flow of spectacular images in a story about Ip Man (Tony Leung), the legendary kung-fu master who trained Bruce Lee."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,88,"The Grandmaster sets aside traditional story structure in its last 15 minutes and becomes one of the filmmaker’s free-form visual poems, suffused with melancholy and compassion."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,83,"Intermittently action-packed and lethargic, the movie dances around formula. By delivering an expressionistic character study with bursts of intensity unlike anything else in his oeuvre and yet stylistically representative of its entirety, Wong practically has it both ways."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,80,"Flawed but often flooring, The Grandmaster swoons with grace, feeling and elegance. With Leung and Zhang on killer form, Wong has delivered his best film in a decade."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,80,It's a film that prompts an overwhelming emotional response as it weaves its dark magic.
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,80,"It may not be much more than six of the most imaginatively staged and filmed fight scenes in the cinema, but that’s almost certainly enough to recommend it."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,80,"It’s certainly not Wong’s greatest work; it may be a masterpiece that evades the mass audience or a beautiful failure with moments of greatness. All I know is that I got lost in it, and that I would still have loved it if it were twice as long with half the action."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,80,"This is a story told in shards; Wong is so obsessed with visual details – faces refracted as if in a broken mirror, or fragile arcs of blood being traced out on the pavement by the feet of two feuding kung fu masters – that the story he’s trying to tell is partly obscured by them."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,80,"True to Wong’s style, The Grandmaster is infused with melancholy and a near-existentialist resignation to the uncertainties of fate."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,80,"Venturing into fresh creative terrain without relinquishing his familiar themes and stylistic flourishes, Hong Kong auteur Wong Kar Wai exceeds expectations with The Grandmaster, fashioning a 1930s action saga into a refined piece of commercial filmmaking."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,"The director took great efforts to be true to Chinese martial arts, but he did so without sacrificing his own distinctive vision."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,"What's on screen in The Grandmaster is off-puttingly disjointed, but it's also dazzling in its startling action and ravishing romance."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,"Who knows what they’re fighting about, but given the ecstatic ballet of fists and water, tossed bodies and smashed decor, centered by Leung’s majestic impassivity, it doesn’t really matter."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,The elegant style of the fighting sequences does more than display camera and kung fu technique — this style also shows fighters living with honor.
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,"Whereas many kung-fu movies are a feast that leaves us weary with sensations, the tastefully bittersweet “Grandmaster” puts us in the mood for more."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,"Tony Leung plays Ip Man, the real-life kung fu innovator who most famously trained Bruce Lee. His life takes in the upheavals in China from the 1930s through the ’50s, including the Japanese occupation."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,"The Grandmaster is a drunken love letter to experience, which helps us survive, and wisdom, which helps us face aging, loss and, ultimately, the abyss. Wong, who was called the coolest director in the world when he was much younger, is now 57. This film is about a man like him, who has proven himself in the world and enters mid-life exuding a new, sage kind of cool."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,"Wong extracts magnetic performances from his two stars, and Philippe Le Sourd delivers gorgeous cinematography."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,"An historical opus that is equal parts ballet and biography, though the second component pales in comparison with the first."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,70,"The U.S. cut, which Wong endorses, runs a slim 108 minutes, and has by all accounts been reshaped for American audiences, who, by and large, don’t have the same foreknowledge of Ip Man, or martial arts, as Asian audiences do."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,67,"At the end of the day, the pesky imperative to convey information is still a driving force; more than anything Wong has ever made, the movie chokes on exposition, its more poetic concerns stifled by its surfeit of plot."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,67,All of Wong's undeniable visual flair can't conceal the haphazard nature of the story.
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,67,"There are sequences in Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai’s new film, The Grandmaster, that are as gorgeous as anything you’ll see on a screen this year, or perhaps this decade."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,63,The Grandmaster offers welcome relief from a moviegoing summer spent in sensory overload.
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,63,"A regal, majestic and downright arty take on this teacher, champion and philosopher whose life spanned much of the twentieth century."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,63,"The film, more likely to invite comparisons to the writings of Marcel Proust than the previous Ip Man films, is a gorgeous folly that never entirely emerges from its creator's head."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,63,"Wong’s visual grandeur is, as ever, all-encompassing."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,60,"Wong’s usual concerns overwhelm the film, and though his pairing of fisticuffs and longing is sometimes awkward, he surrounds the awkwardness with some of the most beautiful images in his career. In Wong’s world, beauty goes a long way."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,60,"The Grandmaster, five years in the making, feels like a waste of Wong’s talents."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,60,"Tony Leung plays Ip Man with his old-movie charisma and reserve, but the film, despite a few splendid fights, is a biohistorical muddle that never finds its center. Maybe that's because — big mistake! — it never gets to Bruce Lee."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,58,"The film is beautiful but troubled, achieving in stretches the director's signature dreamy mood but dragged down by narrative confusions."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,50,"The movie ultimately winds up falling between two stools, failing as both a biography and an action film. Martial arts fans will naturally be drawn to the story, but the film does nothing to open up the world to outsiders."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,40,"The end result feels like only half a movie. That half -- the technical half, with Wong's stylistic flourishes and the film's lush technical elements -- is a heck of a film. The rest of The Grandmaster, however -- the storytelling -- is anything but grand."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,100,"This is high, and high-wire, melodrama. It's less soap opera than grand opera, where matters of love and death are played at a perfect fever pitch. And grand this Golden Flower is."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,100,"It's a work by cinematic geniuses that reveals beauty and terror in a long-ago time with a virtuoso intensity. You won't soon forget its mad, lovely sights and sounds."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,100,"A dazzling costume epic, a spectacle for the eyes and for the soul."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,90,"A period spectacle, steeped in awesome splendor and lethal palace intrigue, it climaxes in a stupendous battle scene and epic tragedy."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,90,"Another remarkable chapter in the career of Asia's most important living filmmaker. After ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" this is the movie to see this season."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,90,"Zhang Yimou's Curse of the Golden Flower is a kind of feast, an over-the-top, all-stops-pulled-out lollapalooza that means to play kitschy and grand at once."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,88,It's a lavish entertainment that revels in lurid colors and yet more lurid emotions.
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,80,"Since his debut in 1987 with ""Red Sorghum"" Mr. Zhang has made more controlled films but never one that's more fun. With Curse of the Golden Flower he aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann. And a good thing too."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,75,Exhaustingly action-packed.
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,75,"It's more theatrical pageant than action movie, with the showy but rudimentary martial-arts action coming off like just another ritual with the players going through the motions."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,75,The Curse of the Golden Flower is the year's most operatic and visually lavish film.
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,75,Director Zhang Yimou's ambitious attempt to blend martial arts action with Shakespearean melodrama. It's not a perfect marriage but it offers two hours of solidly over-the-top entertainment featuring incredible visuals and powerful performances by international icons Gong Li and Chow Yun Fat.
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,75,"Chinese director Zhang Yimou has made some of the most beautiful movies of the last 20 years, and with his latest, Curse of the Golden Flower, he has also made one of the most deliciously nutty."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,75,"Like a soap opera, but most of what glitters is gold."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,75,"Action fans might find the film's first half somewhat of a slog to sit through because of its carefully honed exposition, while those used to Zhang's dialogue-heavy dramas are sure to be surprised by the film's brutal second half where blood spurts more than the words."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,75,"The final effect is stunning, but also sadly impersonal."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,75,"There are fine actors at work here. Chow is quiet and cunning, Gong Li is haughty and cold-eyed, Chen Jin is sturdy as a ghost who appears out of the past, and Gin Junjie is vividly bratty as the youngest, and most underappreciated, prince."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,75,"But as Western analogies go, Curse achieves an emotional fervor more in keeping with ancient Greek mythology than Elizabethan theater."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,70,"Like his ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers,"" Zhang Yimou's third global-market gigaproduction makes little sense in narrative terms even after two screenings, but the sets, costumes, and cinematography are so intoxicating that it doesn't much matter."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,67,"Few filmmakers could produce so grand a spectacle, but Zhang used to be good for more than just eye candy."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,67,"Curse of the Golden Flower is a watchable soap opera, but its marching-band martial-arts scenes are little more than weakly staged retreads of the ones in Zhang's ""Hero."""
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,63,"This colour-drunk, sumptuous late Tang Dynasty (928 AD) drama is huge on spectacle but as devoid of delight as a Cecil B. DeMille biblical epic."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,63,"As easy as this movie is to watch, it's artificially flavored. ""Golden Flower"" runs on crocodile tears and corn-syrup blood."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,60,"Zhang Yimou's strangest and most troubled film, abounds in hysterical, mannered Tang Dynasty-era palace intrigue and dehumanized CGI battle sequences."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,60,"In the end, Curse also looks alarmingly like a dry run for the opening and closing ceremonies Zhang has been hired to direct for the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,60,"Imagine ""The Lion In Winter"" set at a Kylie gig. You can have too much of a good thing, but it is a good thing."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,50,"Curse of the Golden Flower could also be called ""Curse of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.' "" In other words, it is yet another attempt to cash in on the success of Ang Lee's 2000 martial-arts epic, which will go down in the history books as one of the most overrated films of the decade."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,50,The movie has plenty to engage one's interest but little to sustain it.
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,50,"To question that this movie is a visual feast would be an act of real cynicism. But as the old Chinese proverb goes, ""Gold and jade on the outside, rot and decay on the inside."""
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,50,"In Curse of the Golden Flower, Zhang Yimou tries to top the breathtaking poetic spectacle of his masterpiece, ""House of Flying Daggers,"" and instead plummets into self-parody."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,50,"I can say only three good things about his latest martial arts picture, the incoherent The Curse of the Golden Flower: 1) Gong Li deserves better roles, 2) The costumes are astonishingly beautiful, and 3) Ummm...wow, how about those costumes!"
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7,6566773,30,"Zhang Yimou is seriously off his game with the utterly ridiculous Curse of the Golden Flower, a new epic that feels like ""Hero"" meets ""The Lion in Winter"" meets ""Peyton Place."" The film is worthless as a serious work of art, but it may offer the jaded viewer a surplus source of MST3K-inspired wisecracks."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,"A triumph of pure cinema and wonderful visual storytelling from Chandor, who must now be considered the real deal, while Redford is sublime in what could well be the performance of his career."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,"Chandor and Redford make an illuminating procedural of Our Man's response to calamity... Our Man is everyman, revealed by beautifully filmed and edited action without exposition."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,All Is Lost works quite brilliantly on its most basic narrative level.
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,It’s an expertly paced thriller that never misses a note.
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,"Chandor’s attention to detail, and the expressiveness and utter believability with which Redford goes about the anything-but-mundane business of surviving, make All Is Lost a technically dazzling, emotionally absorbing, often unexpectedly beautiful experience."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,"The pacing is perfect, and the action, mostly filmed in a studio, is never less than utterly believable. The director’s first feature, “Margin Call,” was full of rapid-fire dialogue, and he shows off considerable range by following it up with this film."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,"The way that Redford’s character — who for all his namelessness and near-wordlessness emerges as a distinct character, a calm, pragmatic, curious man with a dry sense of humor — struggles with that ultimate question is the beating heart of All is Lost, which somewhere in its second hour goes from being a good movie to being a great one."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,"Here is a formidable opus whose real spiritual relative is Tennyson's ""Ulysses"". Yes. All is Lost is that good."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,"All Is Lost, which is only Chandor's second film, reveals itself as remarkably skillful, surprisingly insightful and deeply moving. It's a confident work by an artist who knows himself and trusts his audience."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,"The ancient Greeks believed that character should be revealed through action. I can’t think of another film that has upheld this notion so thoroughly and thrillingly. There is certainly no other actor who can command our attention — our empathy, our loyalty, our love — with such efficiency."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,"It's a meditation on mortality, with remarkable resemblances to ""Gravity,"" not to mention echoes of ""The Old Man and the Sea."" It's admirably crafted, with a wealth of detail that illustrates the sailor's resourcefulness."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,"There is incredible tension in this ordeal, this effort to survive, to find rescue, and Redford - an icon of the American film experience for more than half a century now - makes that tension deeply palpable."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,"In this film, however, he battles the elements and mortality with a thinking man’s resilience the equal of any astronaut, freighter captain or free man enslaved. That he fights fate on his own makes All Is Lost a signal film achievement and the capstone to a great star’s career. This is Ultimate Redford."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,"Redford will surely earn a well-deserved Oscar nomination for this role, to which he commits with unerring dedication. But the real star is writer/director Chandor, whose painstaking approach is exquisite in its spare integrity."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,All Is Lost is movie magic on many levels but most importantly as the rare opportunity to watch a seasoned actor at the pinnacle of his power.
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,This is Robert Redford doing what too many stars should do and don't: taking a chance. And reinventing his art. It's an extraordinary thing to see.
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,"A genuine nail-biter, scrupulously made and fully involving, elemental in its simplicity."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,100,"Redford, already a giant, has never been more suggestive. His character’s misadventure — might be a kind of cosmic penance. It’s the salvation of the moviegoing year."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,91,"Arguably, the performance is too single-minded to achieve real greatness, but its utter lack of showmanship is precisely what the movie requires; at its best, All Is Lost could almost be a documentary about survival at sea, though it’s more starkly elemental than even nature documentaries usually get."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,91,"Chandor delivers pure cinema. Thrilling and adventuresome, this is a career highlight from the uniquely sympathetic Robert Redford."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,91,The movie is an impressively realized work of minimalist storytelling that foregrounds Redford's physicality more than any other role in his celebrated career. His performance defines the movie to an almost shockingly experimental degree.
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,90,"It’s a classic tale of survival that draws on how movies, in the right hands, can make viewers see the world through others’ eyes, and to feel what keeps them grasping as it threatens to slip away."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,90,"In his late seventies, Robert Redford has never held the camera as magnificently as he does in the survival-at-sea thriller All Is Lost."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,89,"Audience fortitude aside: This is compulsively watchable stuff, a masterstroke of thoughtful direction and thought-provoking performance."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,88,"In this spare, unusual and intimate action thriller, Redford's expressions do nearly all of the communicating. He is the sole human cast member and utters only one word during the entire movie, which covers a span of eight days. The ocean — super-charged and becalmed — gets equal billing. If this sounds bizarre, or like an exercise in tedium, it is neither."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,88,"Redford, who can play intelligence, wit and nuance to a camera like nobody's business, holds us in his grip. It's a master class in acting."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,88,"This solo ordeal won’t be to every taste, but All Is Lost is a grand vehicle for the actor and for that viewer ready to consider his or her own mortality, the problems, conflicts, strengths and shortcomings you’re sure you leave behind when you just sail away."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,83,"If one buys into the whole grace under pressure thing, All Is Lost – the title is its own spoiler alert – is first-rate."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,83,"All Is Lost is a taut, superbly crafted addition to the survival story genre."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,80,"With no 3D, no friends and no hope, Redford and Chandor show how survivalist instincts can stoke thrilling, thoughtful cinema. If Gravity grabbed you, hop aboard and hold tight."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,80,"All is Lost is as quiet as ""Margin Call"" was chatty; at a minimum, you might call this film a procedural. But like the best of the genre, its relentless focus on the material and the practical also gestures subtly at a life of the soul, however battered."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,80,"Unimaginable as anything but a movie. It’s largely wordless, sombrely spectacular, vast and intimate at the same time, with a commitment to detailed physical reality that commands amazed attention for a tight hundred minutes."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,80,"A virtually wordless film that speaks with grave eloquence and simplicity about the human condition. Nothing here feels fancy or extraneous, least of all Redford’s superb performance."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,75,"The presence of Robert Redford gives the character weight, if not depth, because we bring to the film everything we know about the actor from other movies. Redford’s characters have seemed unflappable for more than 40 years: sometimes cool, sometimes cocky, but almost always master of a situation. To see him beginning to flounder is to see a new Redford, one who catches us off guard."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,75,"This very male and methodical movie is like the anti-“Gravity,” as the un-moored hero is quietly in control of his options and at peace with his possible failure."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,75,"Ultimately, your nautical mileage may vary as to whether Chandor and Redford achieve the philosophical and emotional impact they intend, but in a movie that is a demonstration of the importance of trying, they definitely try."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,75,"The film is unusual not so much because of its content - the man vs. nature story has always been a popular one, whether in print or on film - but in its restraint. Putting an actor, even an accomplished one such as Redford, alone on screen for more than 90 minutes is a risk."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,75,The film has a quietly relentless quality. Redford is fully engaged and vital. I'll leave it to others to read greatness into All Is Lost. It's enough that it's good.
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,75,"The film is still a gripping experience, though, with its circling sharks, its sun-dappled beauty and its agonies of shattered hope. At one point I was convinced that Sandra Bullock would splash down next to our man in her space capsule and Hanks’ Maersk ship from “Captain Phillips” would steam by to pick up both of them."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,70,"Redford, who can’t avoid exuding charisma, plays this role with utter naturalism and lack of histrionics or self-regard."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,63,"J.C. Chandor creates an austere snapshot of human struggle, ingenuity, and perseverance, one that's predicated on Robert Redford's fantastic performance."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,60,"It feels like a filmmaker’s exercise rather than an involving motion picture. Although you may never be bored with All Is Lost, you are rarely fully engaged."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,60,"The film’s scope is limited, but as far as it goes, All Is Lost is very good indeed: a neat idea, very nimbly executed."
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,60,Redford delivers a tour de force performance: holding the screen effortlessly with no acting support whatsoever.
All Is Lost,6.9,6263670,50,"All is Lost is more fun to think about than it is to actually watch: It’s a testament to a great actor, an experimental piece of cinema and a bit of a bore."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,60,"It’s far from the perfect storm, but The Hurricane Heist is stupid fun with a belter of a final sequence. Like the sound of a film called ‘The Hurricane Heist’? Then you’ll probably enjoy The Hurricane Heist."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,60,"In many ways, The Hurricane Heist’s lack of self-awareness regarding just how dated it feels plays to its advantage. If you’re looking for that 1997 big-budget CG showcase experience without the wink-wink self deprecating irony of The Lonely Island or Deadpool, then you should be fairly satisfied with this cinematic time capsule."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,60,"The delicious silliness of The Hurricane Heist creeps up on you, because the absolutely wild action sequences as Will weaponizes the hurricane happen with very little fanfare or preparation."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,58,A workmanlike cross between a disaster movie and a caper-chase flick...the film never rises to the promise of its awesomely literal title.
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,50,It’s a silly fun action movie where bad guys get sucked out of a mall and everyone’s hair is wet but also perfect and one of the good guys is a meteorologist who went into the field because a hurricane killed his dad in 1992 and he wants to figure out how to “stop” them.
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,50,"Dialogue tends toward the eye-rolling variety and performances feel uneven across the board, with the actors using a menagerie of accents, including some dubious Deep South ones, as they shout above all the pounding rain and thunder."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,40,"Still coasting on once being the director of the first The Fast and the Furious a full 17 years ago, Rob Cohen is unable to muster true engagement with the banal plot and characters, or deliver the kind of inspired ridiculousness that makes for a guilty pleasure."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,30,"The Hurricane Heist is...a perfect storm of deliriously watchable inanity and ineptitude. It may be a strong early candidate for the worst movie of 2018, but don’t let that deter you – bad movies this fun don’t come along every day."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,30,"The Hurricane Heist delivers what it promises on some basic level; it’s got plenty of hurricane, and it’s got plenty of heist. But those looking for Sharknado-style idiocy will probably be disappointed, as will those looking for anything that makes sense. That might be the film’s fundamental problem."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,25,"One of the dumbest variations of the weather-based action thriller subgenre that I have ever seen, you can be rest assured that I know what I am talking about."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,25,"Aside from those random moments, this is an utter excrement storm, from start to finish. And as bad as the acting, nonsensical plot and dialogue are, there’s not a laugh in this thing — intentional or unintentional."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,10,"Do not shelter yourself from the silliness of The Hurricane Heist. Put down your umbrella, throw your arms open wide and get soaked with its idiocy."
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,80,"If you're interested in heavy-lidded moodiness and lots of attitude, Phillippe and Del Toro can't be beat."
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,80,It's good fun for bad boys.

The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,70,Way of the Gun is a self-consciously American odyssey.
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,63,"A confused, empty, only occasionally funny mess of a movie."
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,63,Falters seriously is its too-leisurely pacing.
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,63,"What pulls us along through the inky shoals of The Way of the Gun? Sheer style, plus the movie's refusal to play nice."
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,63,"So many characters to keep track of, so little time!"
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,63,"Sometimes trips over its own contrivance, especially at the ammo-ridden end."
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,63,Sporadically engrossing in a pulpy kind of way.
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,63,There's a good story buried somewhere in this melee.
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,60,"Each of the talented thesps has some good moments, but, ultimately, none can rise above the limitations of the material and filmmaking."
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,58,A movie that drags.
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,50,"Edgy, hard-boiled crime drama that is very much in this Tarantino-esque tradition."
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,50,A misfire.
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,42,"An empty, affected exercise, executed with just enough style to make you wish McQuarrie had a motive beyond his own career."
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,40,In the end the film has absolutely nothing to say.
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,40,"Isn't a bad film, but as we watch it we're constantly rewriting it in our minds to make it a better one."
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,40,"This film is no ""Usual Suspects,""  because there is no twist, no gotcha."
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,40,An implement of destruction loaded with more borrowed film riffs than could be compiled by 47 clones of Robert Rodriguez..

The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,25,"Rotten, pretentious movie full of minimalist dialogue and self-consciously arty cinematography."
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,20,What aims at being terrifying is just loud and goofy.
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,20,"The directorial debut of the writer of ""The Usual Suspects"" keeps tossing the genre hand grenades one might expect, but they all wind up duds."
The Way of the Gun,6.7,6055661,10,"A lot of uninteresting and unpleasant people torture, abuse, and fire guns at a lot of other uninteresting and unpleasant people, in a repulsive, interminable would-be crime thriller."
Megiddo: The Omega Code 2,4.1,6047691,60,"The movie gets bogged down in dull dialogue, despite some truly impressive special effects and a hilariously silly CG devil who closely resembles his counterpart from the PlayStation game Tekken 2."
Megiddo: The Omega Code 2,4.1,6047691,50,"Ironically, for all the paranoia, York's Defiler and his henchman, an always game Udo Kier, are an oasis of wit in an otherwise parched, self-serious script."
Megiddo: The Omega Code 2,4.1,6047691,40,"What's wrong with Megiddo is not its good-versus-evil theme but the clunky, unpersuasive manner in which it has been expressed."
Megiddo: The Omega Code 2,4.1,6047691,30,Apocalyptic gobbledygook.
Megiddo: The Omega Code 2,4.1,6047691,30,"Barely even worthy of a straight-to-video release, as simplistic and silly as it is."
Highlander,7.2,5900000,40,"Director Russell Mulcahy can’t seem to decide from one scene to the next whether he’s making a sci-fi, thriller, horror, music video or romance – end result is a mishmash."
Highlander,7.2,5900000,38,"About halfway through the violent, fantasy adventure Highlander, one character talks about how it was the custom during ancient times to throw babies into a pit of hungry dogs. Well, there were more than a few times during this hyperviolent film in which I felt as if I were a baby being thrown to a dog of a movie."
Highlander,7.2,5900000,38,"Since none of the characters makes sense even on the movie's own terms, Highlander keeps on exploding for almost two hours, with nothing at stake."
Gymkata,4.3,5730596,75,A true masterpiece of unintentional comedy...fantastically surreal.
Gymkata,4.3,5730596,70,"The end result here is comically entertaining, but entertaining nevertheless - although if you are conditioned to enjoy only those very complicated scenes from newer movies this might be laughable in a less enjoyable way."
Gymkata,4.3,5730596,60,"No real film lover could help but muster some affection for this bedraggled action movie, shot in an extremely unpicturesque Yugoslavia on a budget that must number in the hundreds of dollars. The lead, Olympic gymnast Kurt Thomas, is clearly a stranger to the thespian arts, but it's pointless to single him out in a cast that seems to have been assembled from all the expatriate American used-car salesmen living on the Adriatic coast."
Gymkata,4.3,5730596,50,Mediocre action pulp.
Gymkata,4.3,5730596,38,"Judged against other martial arts pictures, GYMKATA is technically superior and more intelligently written and directed, but that still doesn't make it worthwhile viewing. The film has only a minimum of credibility or intelligence, but since these qualities have little or no place in the genre, that becomes irrelevant, leaving pure action--kicking, punching, and the snapping sounds of breaking bones--as the main draw."
Wind,6.5,5519569,83,"Wind sometimes dawdles, but it’s a sports movie with soul."
Wind,6.5,5519569,80,"Wind is not commonplace movie making. The sailing sequences, including one short, very funny race off Newport involving the kind of small boats you and I might sail, surpass anything I've ever seen on the screen. There are collisions at sea, wrecked spinnakers and freak accidents, like the one during a race when a sailor finds himself hanging upside down from the mast as the other boat gains. These things exhilarate as they threaten to stop the heart."
Wind,6.5,5519569,75,"The real reason to see this movie, though, is because it makes a big yacht race seem so glorious, such grand adventure. Ballard is a former cinematographer with a knack for visualizing the outdoors."
Wind,6.5,5519569,75,"Ballard has infused Wind with an old-fashioned romantic sentimentality that is affecting from time to time. But this and everything else that is good about the picture fights an ultimately losing battle against an inept story that feels like it was constructed from bits and pieces of other, presumably more involving films. It's a shame that director Ballard, who has gone many years between features, has had to set out this time in such a leaky and unsound vessel."
Wind,6.5,5519569,75,Wind is about the huff and puff that's needed to win the America's Cup regatta. It's about tacking faster than your Australian competitors. It's about winning for your country and yourself -- to stirring music. It's also about an hour too long.
Wind,6.5,5519569,75,"The film's glorification of the America's Cup as an exclusive prize in The Wealthy WASP World of Sports can be a tad bit alienating. Nevertheless, Wind manages, for the most part, to be harmless entertainment -- a sort of elitist cotton candy floating in the sea breeze."
Wind,6.5,5519569,75,"Wind, an adventure loosely drawn on yachtsman Dennis Conner's run for the America's Cup, won't sail for luff or money. A wonky idea from the weighing of the anchor, it's essentially an attempt to remake Rocky with a spinnaker."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,50,"Since the film is based on the Atari video game of the same name, it also has much to appeal to headbangers: fast pace, lots of gadgets, monsters, explosive special effects, plenty of inscrutable plot twists and turns."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,30,Here is the horror-action genre at its silliest and most uninspired.
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,30,"Fans of the source material probably won't be switching platforms to catch this bizarre Lions Gate pickup, and non-fans definitely won't."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,30,"Too lazy to play your own d--- video game? Lucky for you there's horror director-for-hire Uwe Boll, who's making a career out of adapting successful Atari and Sega games into tedious popcorn fare that's the ultimate in cinematic passivity."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,30,"A fairly faithful adaptation of what a game is like, but without the pleasure of getting to play or the much-needed option of pressing the ""off"" button."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,30,"Director Uwe Boll (House of the Dead) pulls off a nicely staged fistfight in an open-air market at the start, but soon loses his way amid mind-glazing exposition and endless gunfire aimed at bulletproof giant lizards."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,25,"That this bit of pustulence is based on a video game of the same name is no surprise. It explains the thin plot, characters and abundant gunplay."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,25,"Slater narrates as if reading a restaurant menu. Reid seems to have learned each long sentence in segments, so she wouldn't be overtaxed."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,25,"Even Boll seems to lose interest as the story unravels. By that time, the supernatural cliches, plot inconsistencies, dead ends and red herrings have piled up so high you can barely see the screen."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,25,"Director Uwe Boll (""House of the Dead"") has made a cottage industry out of this kind of junk. Maybe it's time for him to close up shop."

Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,12,Think of the lamest horror movie you've ever seen. Now think of Tara Reid in the lamest horror movie you've ever seen. See how much worse it could have been?
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,12,Alone in the Dark will be the worst movie of 2005. The idea that anything could be worse is the only genuine scare the movie has to offer.
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,10,One of those rare instances of a movie being so bad ... it's still really bad.
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,10,"This is definitely for people who 1) love the video game, 2) think Slater and Dorff are eminently watchable, no matter what bad flick they're in and 3) are wearing industrial-strength ear plugs."

Nikita,7.4,5017971,90,Surprisingly touching.

Nikita,7.4,5017971,80,"It's like ""The Terminator"" as reimagined by the editors of French Vogue."
Nikita,7.4,5017971,75,Ludicrous. Its logic flies out the window like a rocket. It's unbelievable and ridiculous... But fascinating it is.
Nikita,7.4,5017971,75,"Obviously, there's something going on here but I'm not convinced Besson knows what it is."
Nikita,7.4,5017971,70,Always stylish and occasionally thrilling and never thoughtful.
Nikita,7.4,5017971,67,A supremely slick piece of entertainment where style triumphs over substance.
Nikita,7.4,5017971,63,"The film, like Nikita herself, becomes more conventionally sleek and less interestingly bizarre as it moves along."
Nikita,7.4,5017971,60,"Parillaud is expressive but rather mundane. She's best at playing sullen, but there are so many French actresses who specialize in this particular talent -- the French have mastered the apathetic pout -- that she seems generic."
Nikita,7.4,5017971,60,"[Parillaud] remains a totally uninteresting figment of Besson's blinkered movieland imagination, especially when she's in the company of Karyo and Anglade, who provide balance to her overacting."
Nikita,7.4,5017971,60,"The talentless but irrepressibly trendy Luc Besson (""Subway,"" ""The Big Blue"") dreamed up this idiotic story that seems vaguely inspired by Kubrick's (not Anthony Burgess's) ""A Clockwork Orange."""
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,100,"It's an allegory about the Vietnam war, a study of American character and a national propensity for violence. Southern Comfort is a masterpiece."
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,80,"Beyond its genre roots and its deeper meanings, Southern Comfort is a well-honed study of characters and setting."
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,80,A war film without the war but with some interesting observations nonetheless.
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,75,"Stripping these characters to their essences, Hill identifies a shared culture of hatred that unites a range of Americans."
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,75,"Southern Comfort is a film of drum-tight professionalism. It is also, unfortunately, so committed to its allegorical vision that it never really comes alive as a story about people."
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,75,"Arguably writer-director Walter Hill's best film to date, Southern Comfort works both as a pure action film and as an extremely effective allegory of America's involvement in Vietnam."
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,75,"Southern Comfort is a thriller that twists one up in knots, whipping the audience up to a point where they may wish that director Walter Hill would just spring the damn gore already so as to relieve the tension he masterfully coils."
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,70,"Pic is most exciting as a visual experience, as Walter Hill once again proves himself a consummate filmmaker with a great talent for mood, composition and action choreography."
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,70,"Straight-line conflicts, low-light visuals: the film's basics, its strengths, and its critical Achilles' heel are all those of the classic American male action movie."
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,60,The latent wonder of Southern Comfort lies in Hill’s dangerously direction and a script that spits and curses like a troop of undomesticated delinquents.
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,60,"Though the film was photographed on what appear to have been extremely difficult locations in Louisiana and Texas, it never once convinces you that it's anything but pretentious moviemaking."
Let It Ride,6.8,4973285,70,"The major irritant is the hyperactive direction by Joe Pytka, a near-legendary helmer of TV commercials who films each scene as if it were the last, with everybody in the frame strenuously choreographed and overly busy."
Let It Ride,6.8,4973285,50,Pytka's marginally successful at setting this gambler's fantasy against the Damon Runyonesque aspects of the horsy life.
Let It Ride,6.8,4973285,50,"The movie is so witless and confused in tone that its seedy racetrack clientele only emerge as dim, inarticulate cartoons."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,80,"A pitch-black, often very funny slice of pulp fiction with a number of stand-out performances, notably the ferocious Theron."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,75,"A largely fun watch, a corporate crime tale of consistent tartness enacted by a superb cast."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,75,"With a movie like this, either you’ll tap out after 15 minutes or you’ll settle in for an evening of popcorn and beverage-of-your choice escapism."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,75,It’s an especially fun dark comedy from a director and cast who are clearly having a good time allowing themselves to let loose.
Gringo,6.1,4969853,70,"It’s the central performance by Oyelowo, who allows us to laugh at Harold’s naiveté and tomfoolery with some well-placed broad comedy choices while never dropping the ball on the character’s relatability, that makes Gringo a worthy watch for genre fans."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,70,"Gringo is a slightly above-average crime farce with a way above-average protagonist — both in terms of writing and performance, and especially given the genre. It’s a surprising high point in Oyelowo’s already distinguished career."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,67,"The movie has a floppy vibe to it, teetering on lazy farce in its mixed marriage of dry humor and flashes of violence."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,63,"It’s a twisty dark comedy in the action-suspense vein, piled high with talented actors playing cretinous fools and featuring enough betrayals, mistaken identities, and narrative switchbacks to keep you pleasurably befuddled."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,60,"A fun romp with a great comic performance from Oyelowo. Doesn’t linger, but you’ll enjoy it while it lasts."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,58,"Solid chunks of the screwball humor land like bricks, and the characters — most of them idiots, a**holes, or suckers — are colorfully over-the-top but not especially memorable."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,58,"Aussie director Nash Edgerton loads up on some of his signatures, including lots of bad guys, tons of twists, and a dark sense of humor. Unfortunately, his sensibilities are dulled by a sprawling story that never quite snaps together."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"The narrative contains some clever moments but the resolution somehow feels like a cop-out, perhaps because we’ve seen it so many times before."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"It can't decide whether it wants to be magnificently toxic or merely mediocre. Mileage may vary on where the movie eventually lands, but either way, this is a ""romp"" that's keen on going nowhere ... and sloooowly."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"Watching bad people be bad gets tiring, especially when there’s someone like Oyelowo transcending the material to lend complexity and uncertainty."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"The pleasures of Gringo are the pleasures of genre: It’s a fun type of movie, but it’s not a good version of the type."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"Gringo’s obvious debt to the works of Tarantino and the Coen brothers give it a tone that’s too arch and haphazard to keep the audience rooted in its characters. The movie’s sense of humor is about twenty years too old, manifesting in glib jabs at other characters’ expense for being fat, or mentally challenged, or poorly-endowed."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"Director Nash Edgerton never really sinks his teeth into the delectable darkness of his hero’s nemeses, struggling to maintain the right acidic tone."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"There’s an old-school, B-movie snap to much of the proceedings, which Nash Edgerton modernizes without imposing too flashy a style upon the material. It’s pulp, plain and simple, delivering on the chance to watch depraved characters navigate unseemly situations."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"A sometimes amusing, sometimes draggy and overstuffed affair that always relies on its talent-rich cast to carry the day."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"While the fish-out-of-water caper is stuffed with whiplash turns and colorfully eccentric lowlife characters, it never adds up to much. It’s so busy you might think there’s more to it than they’re really is."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"Gringo dabbles in several genres, none particularly well."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,40,"It’s neither funny nor exciting enough to obscure what a miasma of unfocused randomness it is, even though the cast is clearly trying to make something out of all this half-baked material."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,40,"Mr. Oyelowo is without a doubt the best thing in Gringo, supplying the only grace notes in a cacophony of secondhand attitude and facetious overacting."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,40,"The movie achieves a take-it-or-leave-it watchability without being much to look at, and as a nominal thrill ride, it’s underpowered."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,40,"The film periodically livens up, and Oyelowo shows that he can play comedy, but his performance isn’t given much guidance or room to grow and the direction is very flat and uninspired."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,38,"Oyelowo is the one who comes off without a scratch and actually has some quite amusing moments (he has a great, high-pitched scream and solid comedic timing). If only the movie was a better showcase."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,38,"The circuitous narrative of Nash Edgerton's Gringo is such that it never allows for a character or storyline to develop in a particularly efficient way, as every few minutes an abrupt twist or turn sets things off in a new and unexpected direction."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,38,"Everything about Gringo, from the storytelling to the comedy to the cinematography is incredibly lackluster. The film is dark and dim, like everything's covered in a layer of dust. Oyelowo is quite endearing and funny as Harold, but he's given very little to work with."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,30,"This wildly uneven mix of nasty and nervy...is primarily a time-waster, trotting out clichéd misadventure tropes and predictable zigzags in a manner neither terribly funny nor suspenseful."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,25,"Featuring a fittingly shallow funk-lite score by Christophe Beck, Gringo, is ultimately like a Taco Bell version of the ‘90s crime genre; tasteless, cheaply made and just as inauthentic."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,25,"Gringo has no spark, no fizz. Its scenes sag like overstretched taffy. Flavorless taffy."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,25,"Absolutely nothing about Gringo works. Well, maybe one decent car crash pays off. The performances, situations, dialogue and story beats are just flung at the screen in the vain hope that something sticks...Nothing does."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,25,"If someone somehow convinced somebody somewhere to turn the screenplay for Gringo into a real-life motion picture with real-deal actors, then, hell, it could happen to anyone."
The Driver,7.2,4905000,100,"The Driver is a film of types and trends; a cinematic expression of our basest narrative impulses. Directed with remarkable economy, the seasoned Hill keeps everything as tight as possible."
The Driver,7.2,4905000,80,A combination of brilliantly edited car chases and existential thriller which recalls the sombreness of Melville and the spareness of Leone in a context which is the 'classical' economy of directors like Hawks and Walsh.
The Driver,7.2,4905000,80,"The sparse story of the struggle of the two men with their obsessions, and with each other, skillfully creates a mood that is hard to shake after the ending credits. The car chases are breathtaking."
The Driver,7.2,4905000,75,A visceral symphony of screeching tires and crushing metal.
The Driver,7.2,4905000,70,"All of this could have been nice and juicy if Walter Hill had done a few more things with his screenplay, such as made the characters into people."
The Driver,7.2,4905000,63,A fair-to-middling auto-noir with a hole in the middle roughly the size of its leading man’s head.
The Driver,7.2,4905000,60,"Director Walter Hill and stunt coordinator Everett Creach have engineered a number of car chases and they are fabulous, if you like car chases."
The Driver,7.2,4905000,60,"While we can readily identify these characters, we can't identify with them simply because Hill never bothers to tell us what makes them tick."
The Driver,7.2,4905000,50,"Written and directed by Walter Hill, who once wrote and directed a good movie, Hard Times, with Charles Bronson. This one is not good. It is Awful Movie. It is Pretentious Movie. It is Silly Movie. It talks just like this."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,100,"An expert, sensitive study of the fateful tie that inevitably binds the strong to the weak, this film may well be the best western of 1960."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,100,"Deep down, you know it's not as good as Seven Samurai — but few films are. You also know that next time it's on television, you'll find yourself watching it."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,100,"Well-crafted, star-driven entertainment doesn't come much better."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,91,"The basic outline was adapted from Kurosawa's classic Seven Samurai and made into an American Western by one of the great innovators of the genre, John Sturges. The film led the way for other all-star cast outings."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,89,"Very nearly a classic, this Americanization of Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai does a good job of mirroring the major themes and attitudes of the original while re-creating that monumental film in an occidental setting."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,80,The Magnificent Seven fights an uphill battle in matching the scope and thrills of its source material.
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,75,"Until the women and children arrive on the scene about two-thirds of the way through, The Magnificent Seven is a rip-roaring rootin' tootin' western with lots of bite and tang and old-fashioned abandon."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,70,"Sturges' remake of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is always worth a look, mainly for the performances of McQueen, Bronson, Coburn and Vaughn."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,70,"What was wonderful in the Kurosawa film—the recruiting and training of the mercenaries—is just dead time here, though the icon-heavy cast helps out: Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, and Robert Vaughn."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,60,"About two-thirds of the film is good, tough, unromantic period western. About one-third is sentimental nonsense and it bushwhacks the remainder."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,60,"A gifted director like Mr. Sturges (who also produced) can't be held entirely responsible for this endless dawdling prologue, since William Roberts' scenario increasingly flattens the action with philosophical talk on all sides and some easy clichés."
King Kong Lives,3.8,4711220,63,"King Kong Lives, which was directed by John Guillerman, has a dull cast and a plot that's even duller, but the ape himself is in good form."
King Kong Lives,3.8,4711220,50,Director John Guillermin loses all control of the pic.
King Kong Lives,3.8,4711220,40,"The problem with everyone in King Kong Lives is that they're in a boring movie, and they know they're in a boring movie, and they just can't stir themselves to make an effort."
King Kong Lives,3.8,4711220,40,"In all fairness, there is a lot of camp value here. Fans of truly bad cinema couldn't ask for a sillier big-budget production--envisioned with the utmost seriousness."
King Kong Lives,3.8,4711220,38,"King Kong Lives is a terrible film, alternately boring and fascinatingly misguided. But it’s ragingly inessential more than anything else."
"No Retreat, No Surrender",5.7,4662137,40,The karate blows sound good but never seem to make contact. But then nothing else makes contact either. The advice from this corner: Retreat.
"No Retreat, No Surrender",5.7,4662137,40,"A deliciously bad reworking of The Karate Kid, with just a touch of Rocky IV tossed in."
"No Retreat, No Surrender",5.7,4662137,30,Amateurish clunker whose martial-arts action footage is almost as laughably dismal as its acting.
"No Retreat, No Surrender",5.7,4662137,30,"No Retreat, No Surrender borrows heavily from the likes of The Last Dragon, Karate Kid and even Rocky IV, but makes them look like masterpieces by comparison."
The Mighty Quinn,6.1,4557214,100,"The Mighty Quinn is a spy thriller, a buddy movie, a musical, a comedy and a picture that is wise about human nature. And yet with all of those qualities, it never seems to strain: This is a graceful, almost charmed, entertainment."
The Mighty Quinn,6.1,4557214,90,"The Mighty Quinn is a sunny Caribbean caper as giddily seductive as a great big umbrella drink. It's sly, wry and ocean-salty, a detective story with tropical punch."
The Mighty Quinn,6.1,4557214,80,"The movie sparkles with playful tension, bubbles with amiability. The plot is formula, unsurprising, but the film makers and cast seem to be enjoying themselves; their sheer ribald exhilaration becomes infectious."
The Mighty Quinn,6.1,4557214,75,"The plot ambles along, and Denzel is the essence of laid-back professionalism as he deals with corrupt officials, grisly crimes, lustful housewives, and his own divided loyalties. It's an odd, captivating little movie."
The Mighty Quinn,6.1,4557214,75,"The Mighty Quinn is an entertaining, touristy sort of movie that manages to be lighthearted without being soft in the head."
The Mighty Quinn,6.1,4557214,75,"The film's crisp photography and energetic soundtrack liven up a mystery that occasionally defies logic and at other times is transparent--but that never loses our interest, primarily because of Washington's masterfully understated performance."
The Mighty Quinn,6.1,4557214,70,"As if the plot weren't perfunctory enough (bags of Yankee dollars, corruption in high places, CIA asassins), we take extended breaks from it to contemplate Quinn's gradual recovery of his roots, culminating in the grateful islanders serenading him with a reggae version of the title song."
Enemy Mine,6.9,4271684,88,"It may be a long way to go to a distant sun system to get to a familiar place, but the $33 million project is largely successful in establishing a satisfying bond."
Enemy Mine,6.9,4271684,80,Enemy Mine is one of my favorite sci-fi films.
Enemy Mine,6.9,4271684,80,"The movie has the potential to be a truly great story about communication between alien species; it could have been a space thriller with a mind and a heart. Instead, it gives us an alien that is too human, too familiar. It takes that amazing planet and gives it food, water, gravity and atmosphere that are suitable for both humans and Dracs. It depends on plot gimmicks like the convenient arrival of enemies and the equally convenient arrival of friends to the rescue. It doesn't dare enough."
Enemy Mine,6.9,4271684,70,"In trying to cover so many bets, Petersen has created a film without an identifiable style or subject of its own."
Enemy Mine,6.9,4271684,63,"What the film lacks, however, is the epic vision to match its epic pretensions, something to bind together the action and the ideas."
Enemy Mine,6.9,4271684,60,"A costly, awful-looking science-fiction epic with one of the weirdest story lines ever to hit the screen."
Enemy Mine,6.9,4271684,50,"One of the largest wastes of money ever. More than $33 million was spent on this futuristic version of THE DEFIANT ONES or HELL IN THE PACIFIC, both infinitely superior films. The basic flaw is that its premise is older than your great-grandfather's hat."
Gojira,6.2,4116395,50,"Though special-effects experts in Japan and around the world have vastly improved their craft in the last 30 years, you wouldn't know it from this film."
Gojira,6.2,4116395,50,The fatal flaw in Godzilla 1985 is that it is a bad movie with aspirations of being a good bad movie.
Gojira,6.2,4116395,37,"The dialogue tries to give Godzilla some higher meaning, but it doesn't know what it wants that to be."
Tank Girl,5.3,4064333,75,"Lori Petty does a nice job in the title role of this enjoyable 1995 feature based on the postapocalyptic SF comic book and set in the year 2033; it's basically aimed at teenagers, though it's a lot more feminist than what usually passes for adult fare."
Tank Girl,5.3,4064333,70,"A glorious, spastic mess. Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin's neo-underground cult comic book Tank Girl comes to life looking, amazingly, exactly like it ought to, positively overflowing with an ever-changing riot of color, gratuitous violence, inter-species shagging, toss-away one-liners, and gobs of little wonky bits that will either knock you upside the funny bone or leave you reeling from out-of-it confusion."
Tank Girl,5.3,4064333,67,"With a breakneck, don't-bother-to-stop-and-think-about-it pace, Tank Girl zips along for over one-hundred moments, only occasionally lapsing from its zaniness."
Tank Girl,5.3,4064333,63,"Sadly, despite its various attributes and overall funky MTV sensibilities, this never gets quite brutal or blockbusterish enough and the result is a movie both likely to offend the family and infuriate the aficionados in roughly equal amounts."
Tank Girl,5.3,4064333,63,"Since this is thoroughly tongue in cheek, Tank Girl has a likable brashness, even when breathless, pointless plotting threatens to eclipse the movie's charms. Chief among its strong points is Lori Petty, a buzz-cut fashion plate in a Prozac necklace, who brings the necessary gusto to Tank Girl's flippancy."
Tank Girl,5.3,4064333,63,"Whatever the faults of Tank Girl, lack of ambition is not one of them."
Tank Girl,5.3,4064333,60,"Tank Girl - a slapdash but lively film based on the underground comic of the same name - takes militant feminism of the ""Thelma & Louise"" school and weds it to the punk nihilism of the ""Mad Max"" school. Actually, given Tank Girl's personality - sassy, sexy and gun-savvy - ""weds"" is probably the wrong verb."
Tank Girl,5.3,4064333,60,"Petty, though, is the only reason to see this coy and scrappy comic-book adventure-a trash bin of sci-fi detritus."
Tank Girl,5.3,4064333,60,"How well you'll tolerate this utterly unhinged quasi-feminist comic book fantasy depends on your Lori Petty threshold. As the title character--a smartass riot grrrl who rolls through a fanciful postapocalyptic landscape in a tank, occasionally pausing to snuggle and bicker with her mutant kangaroo boyfriend (Ice-T) -- Petty's onscreen virtually nonstop, and her hyperkinetic mugging, jerking, whining, and sassing wears thin after a while."
Tank Girl,5.3,4064333,50,"A classic case of kitchen-sink filmmaking, in which the principals have thrown everything into the stew, hoping enough will stick to the audience...What’s missing from the mix is an engaging story to bind together its intriguing bits. And Lori Petty as Tank Girl, aka Rachel Buck, has the spunk but, sadly, not the heart of the post-apocalyptic heroine."
Tank Girl,5.3,4064333,50,"Generous souls may try to blame this travesty of the Deadline comic-strip on the studio execs who forced director Talalay to tone down and re-edit her cut. But what remains of Petty's anodyne sexless heroine and the dull, episodic live-action sequences suggests we may have been spared something worse even than this movie."
Tank Girl,5.3,4064333,50,"Watching Tank Girl is as disorienting as waking up in someone else's bad dream. You want to get out as fast as possible, but all the exits seem to be blocked."
Tank Girl,5.3,4064333,50,"A lifeless pop vision of the future that tries too self-consciously to be irreverent, hip and cutting edge."
Tank Girl,5.3,4064333,50,Sure Tank Girl has a lot of energy but then so does a Pixie Stix-addled eleven-year-old screaming in your ear about the intricacies of Pokemon for hours at a time during a cross-country road trip. That doesn't mean either ordeal should be experienced by any reasonable human except perhaps as a form of torture.
American Ninja 2: The Confrontation,4.8,4000000,50,"Script by actors Gary Conway (who plays the narcotics overlord) and James Booth trades heavily upon the notion of Americans inherent mental and physical superiority to native warriors, who are a dime a dozen, but in such a comic way that the viewer can laugh with it rather than at it."
American Ninja 2: The Confrontation,4.8,4000000,50,"This one is superior in almost every respect to the first, with slam-bang action, many humorous moments, and an excellent performance by Steve James."
American Ninja 2: The Confrontation,4.8,4000000,50,"In the Cannon Films esthetic, the only good Ninja is a dead Ninja, and the bodies certainly fly fast and furious here. Okay, it's silly, but maybe you were expecting Tess of the D'Ubervilles? And from a director named Sam Firstenberg?"
American Ninja 2: The Confrontation,4.8,4000000,40,Sam Firstenberg--a decent enough action director who's shepherded along three previous ninja movies--here has a story so preposterous that nothing short of a mutiny could make the movie work.
The Adventures of Robin Hood,8,3981000,100,"Only a spirited and extravagant production could do justice to the Robin Hood legend; this film is more than equal to the task. Korngold's score won a well-deserved Oscar, as did the editing and art direction."
The Adventures of Robin Hood,8,3981000,100,"Robin Hood is movie pageantry at its best, done in the grand manner of silent spectacles, brimming over with the sort of primitive energy that drew people to the movies in the first place."
The Adventures of Robin Hood,8,3981000,100,"Made with sublime innocence and breathtaking artistry, at a time when its simple values rang true."
The Adventures of Robin Hood,8,3981000,90,"Film is done in the grand manner of silent-day spectacles with sweep and breadth of action, swordplay and hand-to-hand battles between Norman and Saxon barons."
The Adventures of Robin Hood,8,3981000,75,"Is it a silly movie? At times, yes. Is it creaky and blatant and obvious? Quite often, absolutely. But should you miss it in this splendidly colorful restoration? Not on your life."
Max Steel,4.6,3818664,42,"From its thinly sketched teen protagonist to its deluge of hero-will-rise clichés, Max Steel evinces all of the imagination and ambition you’d expect from a movie based on a bestselling line of action figures."
Max Steel,4.6,3818664,40,"At its best, “Max Steel” shares elements with “Smallville” and “Teen Wolf,” using the supernatural as a metaphor for awkward adolescence. At its worst, it’s more like “Transformers” — an extended toy commercial, noisy and forgettable."
Max Steel,4.6,3818664,30,"As the stuntmen duke it out and we see close-ups of the two actors making silly faces, it's hard not imagine a Mystery Science Theater 3000 feature in the making."
Max Steel,4.6,3818664,30,"If the past is any indication, Hendler, Winchell, Bello and everyone else involved have the capacity to create interesting, original, and engaged art. Max Steel is none of those things."
Max Steel,4.6,3818664,20,"Max Steel may promise a change of pace from all the Marvel and DC adaptations, but it’s subpar to both those shared universes on every level, telling an origin story that brings little new to the table and a cast that deserves far better."
Max Steel,4.6,3818664,20,[A] drearily lame time-waster.
Max Steel,4.6,3818664,12,A movie based on a toy should be a whole lot more fun than this.
Barb Wire,3.3,3794000,70,"David Hogan keeps the action moving and loaded with fights, gun battles and other action-trashy thrills. Lee is terrific."
Barb Wire,3.3,3794000,70,"Lee elevates herself from the lower echelon of mere international super-babedom to the loftier realm of pulp myth. She is ""It"" with an exclamation mark."
Barb Wire,3.3,3794000,70,"Despite its obvious flaws, Barb Wire does what it sets out to do and does it well."
Barb Wire,3.3,3794000,63,"The filmmakers must have known they were not making a good movie, but they didn't use that as an excuse to be boring and lazy. Barb Wire has a high energy level, and a sense of deranged fun."
Barb Wire,3.3,3794000,50,"It's a comic book movie in the broadest sense of the term, and although it's neither as emotionally resonant as ""The Crow"" nor as surreally goofy as ""Tank Girl,"" Barb Wire still manages to get you going, Anderson Lee fan or not."
Barb Wire,3.3,3794000,50,"This rusted-future comic strip comes at you in shards -- exhaustingly derivative images of mayhem and titillation, with Lee, in her bad-girl bondage gear, as its blank vixen. If you didn't call her babe, she wouldn't exist."
Barb Wire,3.3,3794000,40,"Ought to be disreputable fun. Instead it ends up, all its explosions and exposed flesh notwithstanding, rather inert."
Barb Wire,3.3,3794000,40,Isn't much when it comes to either deliberate or inadvertent humor. But it does have a few amusing moments.
Barb Wire,3.3,3794000,40,"Its main source is a comic book, but it might as well be a computer."
Barb Wire,3.3,3794000,30,"Compared to this brash, lunkheaded vehicle for ""Baywatch"" star Pamela Anderson Lee, the Barb Wire graphic novels are masterpieces of subtlety and narrative restraint."
Barb Wire,3.3,3794000,25,"The element of high camp that makes for enjoyable ""good trash"" isn't present."
Barb Wire,3.3,3794000,25,"A convoluted mess, but there have been worse."
Barb Wire,3.3,3794000,25,Muddled futuristic thriller.
Barb Wire,3.3,3794000,0,Numbingly violent action.
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,91,"Fred Dekker’s 1987 horror comedy is, like totally, the ultimate ’80s movie. An agreeably goofy, Little Rascals-meets-The Goonies time passer, the movie is proudly anti-CGI."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,80,"Sharper than a stake in it's genre references, The Monster Squad appeals to cinephile as well as teen sensibilities."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,80,"The film paints a nostalgic portrait of the fears we all shared as children - the common knowledge that when our parents left the room, the monsters under our beds - or locked inside our closest - started to shift and scratch; that our only friend in the midnight hour was the nightlight in the corner of the room."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,80,"The Monster Squad is such fun, it makes you wish you were a kid again."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,80,"It’s every kids dream to fight monsters, and in some ways The Monster Squad helps us live out that fantasy. And it’s a damn good film chalk full of horror movie references, and nods to classic films that only the discernible eye can catch."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,75,"Squad joins The Lost Boys, Fright Night, Gremlins, and Poltergeist in a winning '80s subgenre dedicated to ghoulies invading the suburbs."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,75,"More of a clever comic parody than a jokey pastiche, this lively kiddies' horror pic delivers frights and laughs which are rooted in a sure and sympathetic grasp of Monster Movie mythology."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,70,"A silly attempt to crossbreed an Our Gang comedy with a classic horror film, which usually means that both genres have reached the end of the line."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,50,"Most of what's included in this unapologetically scrambled mixture of Goonies, Hardy Boys adventures, Ghostbusters and Abbott and Costello monster films is bad actors wandering around in bad makeup and rubber masks and two kinds of kids -- cute, intolerably noisy, smart-alecky kids and not-so-cute, noisy, smart-alecky kids. I don't know which kind I liked least."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,50,This second feature from director Fred Dekker is a poorly paced and haphazardly scripted horror-comedy that is neither scary nor particularly funny.
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,50,"Crass but imponderable, bizarrely mixing glowingly back-lit sentimentality with stomach-churning violence and juvenile sex jokes."
Default,4.3,3750000,50,"The film is stronger with its moment-to-moment tension than with its cynical, shallow media satire."
Default,4.3,3750000,42,"There is a better, more contemplative movie to be made with this material, but with Brand and the filmmakers opting for cheap thrills, it leaves the movie, like the passengers on the plane, stuck on the tarmac."
Default,4.3,3750000,40,Default’s search for ultra-realism ironically starts to make it look ultra-artificial.
Default,4.3,3750000,30,Director Simon Brand devotes so much running time to fear-mongering and grotesque stereotypes that a last-ditch effort at moral ambiguity and a critique on muckraking barely register.
Default,4.3,3750000,30,"It sacrifices its voice to the premeditated non-style of a first-person pseudo-documentary, a form that often has the paradoxical effect of making everything it shows us seem more fake than usual."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,The triumphant masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa's fertile twilight.
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"In Ran, the horrors of life are transformed by art into beauty. It is finally so moving that the only appropriate response is silence."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"One of the 10 best films ever made, period."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"Stands separate from the rest, in a pantheon, a true cinematic masterwork of sight, sound, intelligence, and most importantly--passion."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,It’s a dazzlingly successful addition to [Kurosawa's] distinguished career.
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,Ran represents the color/widescreen zenith (qualification necessary due to Seven Samurai) of Kurosawa’s genius for spectacle.
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"The physical scale of Ran is overwhelming. It's almost as if Kurosawa is saying to all the cassette buyers of America, in a play on Clint Eastwood`s phrase, ""Go ahead, ruin your night""--wait to see my film on a small screen and cheat yourself out of what a movie can be."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"Ran, which translates as ""chaos"" or ""turmoil,"" is at once brisk and vital, elegiac and contemplative, intimate and epic, tragic yet shot through with humor. It combines the energy of youth with the perspective of maturity. It encompasses all of human nature in its folly and grandeur, and it does so in images as beautiful and terrifying as any ever captured on film and in performances that are impeccable."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"Quite simply, Ran is a great, nightmarish motion picture."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"If Shakespeare's poetry enters the mind through the ear, Kurosawa's enters it through the eye. But the imagery is of comparable quality, at once awesome in its power, delicate in its irony and, finally, for all the violence of the events it recounts, eerily serene in the sureness with which it achieves its effects."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,The drama itself packs a powerful -- and timeless -- gut punch.
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"Though big in physical scope and of a beauty that suggests a kind of drunken, barbaric lyricism, ''Ran'' has the terrible logic and clarity of a morality tale seen in tight close-up, of a myth that, while being utterly specific and particular in its time and place, remains ageless, infinitely adaptable."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"Ran is a great, glorious achievement."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,A stunning achievement in epic cinema.
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"In Ran, color plays a role not unlike that of language in ""Lear"": a kind of ground bass of beauty, a product of pure imagination, that both affirms life and surpasses it. Yet Kurosawa uses that beauty more as negation: a reminder not of what man is capable of but how puny he is in comparison."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"A magisterial film, but not quite a great one."
Ran,8.2,3522421,95,"Save for one startlingly staged battle sequence. . .might as well have been titled ""Also Ran."""
The Wraith,5.9,3500000,70,"If you're a fan of revenge fantasies, The Wraith will likely whet your appetite even if it isn't the smartest or best film out there."
The Wraith,5.9,3500000,67,"The Wraith’s plot is predictable and its genre nods skimpy (primarily limited to The Mystery Racer’s ability to resurrect himself after crashes), but Marvin directs with real energy and wit."
The Wraith,5.9,3500000,60,"Mr. Cassavetes is effectively black-hearted, and makes a striking figure, and Randy Quaid does a lot with the underdeveloped role of a local sheriff. Mr. Marvin directs at a brisk pace, but his screenplay, though lively, seems to be written in an alien language."
The Wraith,5.9,3500000,50,"The Wraith is hardly more than it’s surface. The synopsis says it all and there’s very little character development outside of gang leader Packard (Nick Cassavetes, making his parents so proud) being motivated to pound on or murder other guys because they talk, let alone make love, to a girl he likes (Sherilyn Fenn)."
The Wraith,5.9,3500000,50,"Gang of comic-strip killer car-thieves is led by lip-curling psycho Packard (Cassavetes). The town (comprising one house, a burger joint and no citizen who isn't a teenager or a cop) is overseen by Sheriff Randy Quaid, who displays all the reverence the script deserves. Best joke is having one of the thugs know a word like wraith."
The Wraith,5.9,3500000,40,"The Wraith is essentially a wall-to-wall car chase that writer/director Mike Marvin attempts to enliven with TV commercial visuals, tough-guy dialogue and modestly inventive casting."
The Wraith,5.9,3500000,38,"The movie has an absurd script, fueled by that current B-movie staple, the idiot plot--a plot that proceeds only because all, or most, of the characters, act like idiots."
The Wraith,5.9,3500000,30,"There's some fun potential here, but Marvin's direction is plodding enough to snuff it fairly quickly. Yet Charlie Sheen, promising in his second-banana appearances in Lucas and Pretty in Pink, emerges with his promise intact. Sheen already has the reserved but powerful manner of a Wayne or an Eastwood; with a little more maturity, he could be a contender."
The Wraith,5.9,3500000,25,"Director-writer Mike Marvin is obviously working out of his element, which consists of ski films and features with titles of things you eat or drink (Six Pack; Hot Dog--The Movie; and Hamburger). The best thing here are the cars, which have no dialog and just stand around looking fast. Sheen's is a specially built Dodge pace car that cost over $1.5 million."
Born American,4.3,3388020,75,"The movie is Rambo crossed with Fraternity Vacation and a bad cartoon version of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. It's an amazingly senseless movie, done with blood-curdling confidence. Each jaw-dropping howler is staged with such rattling intensity and perfect, seamless idiocy that it becomes weirdly amusing."
Born American,4.3,3388020,30,"Comprised of so many derivative bits and pieces that it's not surprising the movie has too little narrative coherence or momentum to keep us going, and no characters we care about enough to root for."
Born American,4.3,3388020,30,"The strange thing about this film is that there are some interesting--albeit half-baked--ideas floating around in the script, and the direction shows some skill and style. However, the plot is ludicrous from start to finish, the characters one-dimensional, and the world-view simplistic."
Near Dark,7,3369307,100,"A romance, a western, and a totem to lost youth in an era ravaged by infection and addiction, it’s a high-water mark in a decade filled with exemplary genre fare. Borrowing from, and surpassing, the exceptional chemistry of Aliens’s tightly knit cast, the melancholic Near Dark is gorgeous even in its savagery, and one of pulp cinema’s greatest achievements."
Near Dark,7,3369307,100,"A smart, creepy, violent, funny, and modern vampire movie that benefits from some wonderful performances, a stunning visual texture, and music by Tangerine Dream."
Near Dark,7,3369307,90,"Western iconography, noir-ish lighting, and visceral horror are fused with an affecting love story in this stylish 'Vampire Western', which (unlike Bigelow's rather static debut feature The Loveless) is driven forward at a scorching pace, a subtle study in the seductiveness of evil and a terrifying ride to the edge of darkness."
Near Dark,7,3369307,90,"If you enjoy good horror or vampire flicks, Near Dark is one of the best."
Near Dark,7,3369307,90,"One regrets the pounding Muzak of Tangerine Dream, but this is on the whole a striking directorial debut, at once scary and erotic, with lots of sidelong touches in the casting, direction, and script ."
Near Dark,7,3369307,88,"There are no gothic extravagances in Kathryn Bigelow's bone-dry, style-rich, noir-steeped vampire western. Instead it comprises a fascinatingly modern take on blood sucking mythology, shedding tradition to examine the creatures as human counterparts."
Near Dark,7,3369307,80,"Bigelow gets a scary poetry out of these landscapes--and though the film is erratic, it has force and passion...It works on your nerves--not necessarily through its big shock scenes, but through the atmosphere it creates: the sense of dread, no exit, lives plunging out of control, the secret mad pull of murder and outlawry."
Near Dark,7,3369307,80,"Main point of interest will be the work of Bigelow, who has undoubtedly created the most hard-edged, violent actioner ever directed by an American woman."
Near Dark,7,3369307,80,"Bigelow, who codirected THE LOVELESS with Monty Montgomery in 1982, and coscreenwriter Eric Red (THE HITCHER) demonstrate a keen understanding of the history of American cinema and create a unique film that explores the conventions of the vampire movie while moving it from dank European castles to modern-day Southwestern America."
Near Dark,7,3369307,75,"It has extravagant, bloody thrills plus something else -- something that comes close to genuine emotion."
Near Dark,7,3369307,75,"This modern-day vampire movie is, to be sure, no masterpiece, but its suggestive narrative and dreamlike visual style are distinct improvements over those of such recent living-dead flicks as The Lost Boys and Vamp. And if Near Dark doesn't provide a complete answer to the ''necking'' question it raises, well, heck, it's an exploitation film, not an advice column."
Near Dark,7,3369307,75,"Near Dark has filmmaking finesse to spare, but puts its dank characters on display rather than cadging sympathy for them. It is the Blue Velvet of date-night spook shows."
Near Dark,7,3369307,70,"Directed by Kathryn Bigelow with lots of dull spots, a few effectively intense moments, and as much gore as the monster genre usually calls for nowadays."
Near Dark,7,3369307,70,You might call this the scattershot school of film making... The result of being pushed and pulled through the confusing styles of Near Dark is simple exhaustion.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,100,Jim Jarmusch has come up with something strange and amazing.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,100,"Laced with brilliantly knotted ideas on race, masculinity and cults of violence."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,91,"It's a nearly pitch-perfect melding of genres, influences and modes of expression--it's the first Mafia movie for the hip-hop age."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,90,"What makes the film so special is that while tickling your postmodern funnybone, it never forgets to make you care for its characters, in a welcome, and almost traditional way."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,90,It's the kind of movie you wish you had more time to absorb and could see more than once before reviewing.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,90,Perversely funny.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,89,The result has the dingy grace of pigeons flying across an urban wasteland.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,88,"This infusion of warrior philosophy is the gas in Ghost Dog's tank, and Jarmusch pumps it up for maximum octane throughout."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,83,Weirdly intriguing.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,80,Whitaker's acting is highly creative and Jarmusch's filmmaking is as elegant and original as ever.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,80,"(Jarmusch's) most accessible film after ""Night on Earth,"" yet it's still elliptical and enigmatic."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,75,"It's beautifully cast and filmed (cinematography by the matchless Robby Muller) and often quite moving, despite the fact that most of the characters are never developed much beyond mythic or parodic prototypes."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,75,"Every minute he's on screen, Whitaker makes Ghost Dog worth watching."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,75,"(Jarmusch) seems...to introduce gratuitous bloodshed that is out of sync with the engaging, offbeat tempo and dark, comedic moral fable that has come before."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,75,"Best when it's playful, toying with the fact that the Mafia has in a single generation been transmogrified from myth to joke."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,75,"A movie as laconic as its hero, Ghost Dog is nonetheless diminished by its most un-Zen-like attachment to this underlying sentimentality."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,75,"There is a lot of violence, but not much action; a plot involving vengeance, jealousy and double-crossing, but not a great deal of suspense."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,70,Am I the only one who finds the substance of this movie repulsive?
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,70,Points for an interesting concept; demerits for the dull execution.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,67,The gambits in Ghost Dog seem simply like literary and cinematic games devoid of any larger meaning.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,63,"It's too bloody to be funny and too silly to be dramatic and too self-indulgent to be anything other than what it is, one more bad movie."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,63,It's too cryptic and unfulfilled to serve as a tool for anything beyond its own obfuscation.
Cannonball!,5.5,3270000,67,"Sharp-eyed viewers will spot director Corman, Martin Scorsese, Sylvester Stallone, Joe Dante, and Paul Bartel in bit parts while Mary Woronov takes an incredibly long time to maneuver her van through a multi-car pileup. Sure, it's a ripoff. Sure it's brainless. Cannonball is still a definitive drive-in car chase flick that's gonna make you want to tromp the gas pedal and burn rubber on the way home."
Cannonball!,5.5,3270000,40,Far from Bartel's best exploitation work but worth a look for low-budget cult fanatics.
Cannonball!,5.5,3270000,40,"Cannonball lacks its predecessor's dramatic tension, and by the middle of the film Bartel's disregard for narrative in favour of a series of jokes leaves no dramatic resolution."
Cannonball!,5.5,3270000,30,Cannoball will please those who won’t rest until they see every car in creation destroyed and aflame.
Cannonball!,5.5,3270000,25,"It tries for the greatest realism in its obligatory shots of gas tanks exploding, and yet includes such absurdities as a local news helicopter that tracks all of the competitors all the way from LA to New York. To be sure, without the traffic copter the story would have been impossible to follow - but then why follow the story anyway? In the meantime, can we possibly hold our breath for ""Gumball Rally?"" I'll bet I can."
The Legend of Billie Jean,6.6,3099497,63,"The Legend of Billie Jean is trashily manipulative and utterly preposterous, so much so that, until the end (when it begins to sour on you), it's a thoroughly enjoyable hoot. Add a splendid cast and good air conditioning, and it's a perfectly mindless way to spend a muggy summer evening."
The Legend of Billie Jean,6.6,3099497,50,"The Legend of Billie Jean' is competently made, sometimes attractively acted, and bankrupt beyond belief. It's hard to imagine that even the film makers, let alone audiences, can believe in a sweet, selfless heroine who just can't help becoming a superstar."
The Legend of Billie Jean,6.6,3099497,50,Four-letter words and gags about periods fail to disguise the adolescent wish-fulfilment quality of script and direction.
The Legend of Billie Jean,6.6,3099497,50,"Though obviously designed for the teenage market, Billie Jean should insult the intelligence of all but the most irredeemable mall rats."
Hanover Street,6.1,3000000,50,Hanover Street is reasonably effective as a war film with a love story background. Unfortunately it's meant to be a love story set against a war background.
Hanover Street,6.1,3000000,50,"Director Hyams tries desperately to evoke the feel of the best of the 1940s wartime romantic dramas but, despite solid performances from the leads, his screenplay is predictable and trite, leaving the audience little to look forward to."
Hanover Street,6.1,3000000,40,"Every now and then a film comes along of such painstaking, overripe foolishness that it breaks through the garbage barrier to become one of those rare movies you rush to see for laughs. The clichés were everywhere, but always just slightly out of place and inappropriate."
Hanover Street,6.1,3000000,20,Gung-ho American World War II bomber pilot falls for an already married English rose during teatime rendezvous in war-torn Hanover Street. Anaemic and foolish.
Gleaming the Cube,6.2,2777280,63,"There's a genuine attempt in Gleaming the Cube to deal with the impact the loss of a brother has upon a likable, footloose teen-ager. Unfortunately, the conventions of the action-adventure/youth-flick genres prevail. The result is an exploitation picture with a little something extra--lots of awesome skateboard wizardry, culminating in a speed-of-lightning chase sequence, in which skateboards are pitted against cars."
Gleaming the Cube,6.2,2777280,60,"The plot of Gleaming the Cube is far from original, but the skateboarding sequences are exhilarating and add a great deal of excitement to otherwise routine material."
Gleaming the Cube,6.2,2777280,60,"Gleaming the Cube (the title refers to achieving the skateboarding equivalent of cosmic bliss) has an intrigue plot that is unremarkable, and it doesn't do anything terribly novel with the relationship between Brian and the policeman (Steven Bauer) who helps investigate the case. It becomes somewhat more interesting in exploring the Vietnamese community of Orange County, Calif., especially in its tinier details."
Gleaming the Cube,6.2,2777280,50,"With the screenplay dabbling with too many issues and stereotypes, the characters are largely one-dimensional and the relationships unconvincing."
Gleaming the Cube,6.2,2777280,50,A slight skateboard thriller that looks more like one of those Afterschool Specials on television than a bona fide feature film.
Gleaming the Cube,6.2,2777280,50,"Slater, who sounds as if he is trying to imitate Jack Nicholson, is the only character who has a shading of personality. His skateboarding buddies are funny, considering one needs a glossary to translate their dialog, while the Vietnamese are mostly sleazy cardboard figures."
Gleaming the Cube,6.2,2777280,50,"Performances, plot and landings are nailed down, but there's not enough invention here for the film to achieve cult status."
Gleaming the Cube,6.2,2777280,40,"Clifford can muster no interest in the cardboard characters or absurd plot developments, which leaves Gleaming the Cube to limp along listlessly between indifferently filmed skateboard demonstrations."
Kingu Kongu tai Gojira,5.9,2725000,60,"It's a peculiar kind of humor, but it does play."
Kingu Kongu tai Gojira,5.9,2725000,60,It began a transition in the series away from horror and toward kid-friendly adventure.
Kingu Kongu tai Gojira,5.9,2725000,50,"On the plus side, King Kong Vs. Godzilla had a higher budget than most films, and it shows."
Kingu Kongu tai Gojira,5.9,2725000,20,The one mild surprise of this cheap reprise of earlier Hollywood and Japanese horror films is the ineptitude of its fakery.
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,75,"Ip Man 3 also sneaks in welcome moments of mushy romantic sweetness between Master Ip and his wife, Cheung Wing-sing (Lynn Hung)."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,75,"As it happens, the weakest part of Ip Man 3 is its run-of-the-mill, almost juvenile potboiler plot."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,70,"Ip Man 3, set in Hong Kong circa 1959, combines the customary, inventively choreographed action with an unexpected emotional depth, proving as hard to resist as its entertaining predecessors."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,70,"Stone-faced martial-arts star Donnie Yen does a lot with a little in wuxia weepy Ip Man 3, the rare kung fu film whose sentimental dialogue scenes are just as good as its stripped-down action sequences."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,63,"[Ip Man] is the calm at the center of a storm of kung-fu combat sequences, and Yen plays him with grace and serenity."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,63,"Ip Man 3 credibly conjures the period with soundstage sets, rock-and-roll oldies and slicked-back hair. But director Winston Yip shows less concern for authenticity in Ip’s antagonists."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,60,"Unassuming, likable entertainment."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,60,"This time, celebrated action director Yuen Wo-ping, taking over from Sammo Hung, ensures the film’s fight sequences remain the film’s primary focus, although the overall tone is smaller and quieter, reflecting both the personal drama Ip Man encounters and Donnie Yen’s own encroaching retirement from kung-fu cinema."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,50,"Less offensively nationalistic than the second installment but falling short of the glowing humanity, genial Cantonese humor and visual flair of the first, the pic is somewhat tarnished by its pedestrian plot and limp characterization."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,50,"For all its grand promises, Ip Man 3 teeters uneasily among B-movie clichés."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,50,"Despite Mr. Yen’s impressive physical virtuosity, his stoic, often humorless presence tends to neutralize the emotional temperature."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,50,"Returning director Wilson Yip commits to this tone too late, getting lost in tangential conflict and stunt casting — in this corner, Mike Tyson! — at the expense of the drama and even the action."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,50,"In the end, Ip Man 3 doesn’t quite rise to the dizzying heights of the first two films, but then again, this will almost certainly be your only chance to see Mike Tyson go up against Donnie Yen."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,50,Donnie Yen's performance is so good that it's a shame Wilson Yip's films have never strived to be more than briskly entertaining hagiography.
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,2.4,2409225,60,"Managing to transcend the formulaic plot are Frewer and Bergin, whose performances make the film work. Frewer, reunited with his “Max Headroom” director, Farhad Mann, veers from the real — and still somewhat dull-witted — Jobe to the megalomaniacal virtual Jobe without missing a beat."
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,2.4,2409225,50,"Darting around a futuristic Los Angeles on motor scooters that can fly, these plucky whiz kids are so indomitably cheery that they seem more mechanical than the demented cyber-messiah who tries to destroy them. At least he has a temper."
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,2.4,2409225,50,"Two points save ""Lousy 2"" from the absolute abyss. One is a couple of imaginative touches in the art design: Cori drives an old Citroen, and a couple of Vespa-like motor scooters are briefly glanced. The other is the performance of Frewer, who played the lead in TV's ""Max Headroom."" He endows the character with more sardonic humor than we have a right to expect from the junky script by TV-oriented director Farhad Mann."
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,2.4,2409225,50,"All in all, this is not a Jobe well done."
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,2.4,2409225,38,"This time around, expect more of the same -- a tedious, muddleheaded tale about a malevolent spirit haunting cyberspace -- with somewhat tastier special effects."
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,2.4,2409225,38,"Having jettisoned all but one of the original cast, this cynical sequel retreads familiar ground, provoking both disorientation and déjà vu."
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,2.4,2409225,38,"Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace is a bad movie, wrongheaded in its concept and empty in its execution."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,40,"There are all sorts of noteworthy people in this silly vampire epic, including acting greats Sir Ben Kingsley and Geraldine Chaplin, but the only artist this critic wants to heap praise upon is the regrettably unidentified Supervisor of Blood Splatter: Nice work, dude."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,40,"The only thing left unsliced is the ham in BloodRayne, yet another video game adaptation by German genre specialist Uwe Boll and a movie with more fading - or faded - talent than an Italian basketball team."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,33,"With minimal flare and maximal gore, Boll simply delivers the turgid drama and incompetently staged action sequences that have made him the unstoppable Big Boss of the gaming community."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,30,"Attention, Ben Kingsley (I mean, Sir Ben Kingsley): It's officially time to turn in your Oscar."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,30,"Our blood-smacking antiheroine, Rayne (Kristanna Loken), isn't a vampire; she's a dhampir, a half-human, half-vampire cross-fiend who's as anguished, strange, and sloppy as mercenaries, or movies, get."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,30,"Just when you thought camp was dead, along comes this bizarre cross between a Tarantino knockoff and a Hammer horror film."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,25,Yet another ill-conceived big screen videogame adaptation.
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,25,Why do moviegoers and gamers keep going to see video-game-based movies when neither group is ever happy with the results?
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,25,"While there's no fun in mediocrity, ludicrousness is another matter. Boll is the best at what he does, and what he does is make truly terrible films."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,25,Semicoherent.
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,20,Anemic action-fantasy.
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,0,"Maybe everyone involved was hoping that no one would see this movie, but Madsen is the only one who should fear anyone seeing his work."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,0,Ghastly-bad.
Gwoemul,7,2201923,100,"The mix of dark humor, creeping suspense, and a sort of apocalyptic tenderness makes this the best horror flick in years."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,100,A great piece of filmmaking and a legitimate science-fiction/horror classic.
Gwoemul,7,2201923,100,"Joon-Ho's epic is a masterpiece of monster cinema that's intelligent, innovative, and reaches down to the basic core of family unity to propel its story beyond mere conventions of science fiction."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,100,The Host isn't just a terrific monster movie. This South Korean box-office smash is also a laugh-out-loud comedy and a surprisingly angry political satire.
Gwoemul,7,2201923,100,I have seen The Host twice and have every intention of watching it again.
Gwoemul,7,2201923,91,"Bong Joon-ho's wildly entertaining saga should become the hip, thinking-person's monster movie of choice."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,91,"A cross between ""Godzilla"" and ""Jaws,"" it manages to be both truly scary and truly funny – sometimes all at once."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,91,"The sudden turns of temperament are a treat after the smart-ass attitude of American horror flicks, and the film is full of minor surprises, squirming in unexpected directions without leaving the conventions behind."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,90,"With a subversive streak as wide as the Han and a title open to interpretation, The Host confounds our expectations while providing top-notch entertainment. For Bong, the monster movie is an ample vessel, one that he can fill with social criticism while discovering exuberant amusement in the process."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,90,"The Host is a cautionary environmental tale about the domination of nature and the costs of human folly, and it may send chills up your spine. But only one will tickle your fancy and make you cry encore, not just uncle."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,90,"If this madly entertaining movie has a fault, it's that it's too ingenious for the genre it ostensibly inhabits."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,90,"The movie pops up out of nowhere, grabs you in its big, messy tentacles, and drags you down into murky depths, where social satire coexists with slapstick, and B-movie clichés mutate into complex metaphors."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,89,"The Host is a freewheeling mix of high style and goofy, good-natured fear-mongering."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,88,"When the movie isn't being scary, it's crazily funny, so much so that critical watchers will wonder if Bong might tilt the balance of the picture too far in a comic direction and water down the scares. He doesn't."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,88,"The tone of The Host is slippery in the best way; you're never sure if you're in for a joke or a shock, yet nothing feels random."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,88,This Korean-made film takes the well-worn creature-feature genre and spins it on its head thrillingly.
Gwoemul,7,2201923,88,A fantastical genre-buster.
Gwoemul,7,2201923,88,"Boon's film is both funny and heartbreaking, a supremely confident mix of political satire, free-floating paranoia, fractured family dynamics and the kind of comedy that regularly reconfigures itself into tragedy."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,88,"Mostly, though, it's ""Godzilla"" with a severe case of Murphy's Law, and it is never less than bizarrely delightful."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,88,"Is it that scary? Yes. Will it reduce you to quivering jelly? Oh, my, yes! Does it bust the bonds of the Godzilla formula to fuse fright with feeling? Better believe it, dudes."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,88,"A wonderful, witty mix of horror and social satire, The Host takes its simple, time-tested premise - menacing creature terrorizes the populace - and runs with it."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,88,"The first 20 minutes of the South Korean film The Host represents one of the most entertaining movie openings in memory. It's the same kind of pop-culture thrill provided by Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws,"" with the same sense of astonishment, fear and pleasure at something genuinely new."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,83,"Most of all, The Host functions as a popcorn movie par excellence, loaded with the most familiar conventions, but shot through with such conviction and visual panache that even its clichés seem invigorating."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,80,"On almost every level, there's never quite been a monster movie like The Host. Egregiously subverting its own genre while still delivering shocks at a pure genre level, and marbled with straight-faced character humor that constantly throws the viewer off balance."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,80,"The Host packs a lot into its two tumultuous hours: lyrically disgusting special effects, hair-raising chases, outlandish political satire, and best of all, a dysfunctional-family psychodrama--an odyssey that's like a grisly reworking of ""Little Miss Sunshine."""
Gwoemul,7,2201923,80,"The Host is a miracle of breathless play with form and tone that also seethes with attitude and ideas, from pure movie love to pointed sociopolitical commentary to a bleak existentialism about the inherent cruelty of our world."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,80,"A thrilling ride and a sometimes dry, sometimes sweet comedy, but beneath all that is a humane and tragic view of life worthy of the greatest films. Even those without rubber monsters."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,75,"Bong's primary point is dead-on: Battling bureaucracy, from dishonest government leaders to indifferent civil servants, is the biggest horror of all."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,75,"I never thought I'd crack up watching a family mourn the death of a beloved daughter. But I've never seen a film quite like The Host, and that's far from the most bizarre thing in it."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,75,"Although it strikes a perfect balance between otherworldly, slimy menace and 1950s B-movie cheesiness, The Host's computer-generated mutant isn't what makes this frantic, wild picture so much fun."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,70,"Bong has pulled together a multilayered horror-drama that works more often than not. The film gets back on track after a clumsy middle section that's too long and finishes strong, and Bong fans, horror fans and Asiaphiles are likely to be thoroughly satisfied."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,70,"Gross-out horror is never far from comedy and The Host, Bong Joon-ho's giddy creature feature, has an anarchic mess factor worthy of a pile of old ""Mad"" magazines."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,70,It's the last thing anyone expected: an old-fashioned monster movie with a heart.
Gwoemul,7,2201923,63,"The Host is a strange little movie: part creature feature, part social commentary, and part slapstick comedy. The problem with the film is that the sum isn't greater than the parts and the pieces don't fuse in a way that's consistently pleasing or cinematically satisfying."
Gwoemul,7,2201923,58,"In ""Jaws,"" you didn't know whether to laugh or to scream. In The Host, the yocks rarely mesh with the yucks."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,91,"In the end, the most impressive performance may be Spike Lee's. He uses skill without gimmickry, flash without fuss, to tap the mesmerizing soul of this pulp."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,88,"Lee’s is more of a hard-edged, hammer-and-nail noir than Park’s existential horror, and it’s far less concerned with the internal state of Joe’s mind than the external havoc it creates."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,88,It’s generally a respectful homage that has every bit as much stylishness and visual flair.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,83,"It's been so long since Lee made such a thoroughly amusing work that fans should have no problem excusing its messiness. But make no mistake... Oldboy is all over the place, sometimes playing like a subdued melodrama and elsewhere erupting into flamboyance and gore."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,75,"This American version of Park Chan-Wook's Korean thriller is Lee's most exciting movie since ""Inside Man"" — not a masterpiece by any stretch, but a lively commercial genre picture with a hypnotic, obsessive quality, and an utter indifference to being liked, much less approved of."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,75,Oldboy is an immersion into pure twistedness. The purity of its twistedness is its saving grace.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,70,"Oldboy suggests a filmmaker doing almost as much soul-searching as the main character. There is a brashness in the risks taken, the very imperfections revealing an artist finding new inspiration. For Lee, this weird, brutal film seems to have freed him."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,70,"Surprisingly, the movie doesn’t bear much of the stylistic stamp we’ve come to expect of Lee, who’s in his generic journeyman mode here. But aside from a satisfyingly clever new direction in the denouement, what distinguishes the remake from the original is its cartoonishness."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,67,"For better and worse, Lee’s Oldboy is a more somber affair."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,63,One of the surprises of Spike Lee’s Oldboy is just how dark the film dares to get.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,63,Lee’s Oldboy stands on its own. It just stands a bit shorter.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,63,"In general, Lee directs with less visual verve than Park. Anchored by Brolin, who brings an almost simian physicality to his portrayal, this Oldboy feels simultaneously less showy, less nightmarish and less epic than the original."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"Oldboy is lively but numb — checked out, as if Lee were directing it following a period of intense convalescence."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"Most normal people will not see this as a ""pleasant"" film -- I hope that's the case, anyway -- but it certain makes you feel something."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"Watching Spike Lee’s decent but unmemorable remake of Park Chan-wook’s 2003 revenge picture ""Oldboy,"" I kept trying to figure out why he’d done it."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"If you have seen the earlier version, you can occupy yourself with point-by-point comparisons. If not, you may find yourself swerving between bafflement and mild astonishment, wondering how a movie that works so hard to generate intensity and surprise can feel so routine and bereft of genuine imagination."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"Weaknesses from the original remain, including a mustache-twirling villain straight out of a Bond film (Sharlto Copley) and a Freudian master plan that unravels the more you think about it. Give credit to Lee for staying fresh, even if this feels like slumming."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"Leave it to Spike Lee to deliver one of the strangest, most off-putting movies for the Thanksgiving holiday."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"While Lee leaves some of Park's more memorable outrages behind, he and screenwriter Mark Protosevich find one or two ways to up the taboo-testing ante, small surprises that retain the tale's edge without pushing into the realm of exploitation."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,58,"Lee is very good at creating a sense of free-floating dread, but he, and his screenwriter Mark Protosevich, don’t have a real flair for pulp."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,58,"Spike Lee's remake of 2003's Oldboy is as brutally perplexing as the South Korean original, and needless for both its repetition and tweaks. Nothing is really lost in translation, or gained."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,50,"While few will debate Lee's ability as a director, this isn't close to being in his wheelhouse. Oldboy cries out for a Brian DePalma, a Quentin Tarantino, or even a David Lynch. The end result bears out the suspicion that Lee isn't right for the material, nor it for him."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,50,"Like Martin Scorsese’s ""The Departed,"" a bloated Americanizing of the Hong Kong cop movie ""Infernal Affairs,"" the Lee Oldboy will startle newbies with its story ingenuities and morbid revelations, while leaving connoisseurs of the source film wondering why Hollywood couldn’t have left great enough alone."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,50,Graphically gruesome when it means to be a provocative look at vengeance.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,50,"Lee, in a sort of humorless send-up of Tarantino, substitutes kinky for mystery, explicit sex and violence for sex and violence with real shock value. When it comes to this remake, you plainly can’t teach an oldboy like Lee new tricks."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,42,"While Lee edges in enough unique elements to argue a second look at the brutal revenge tale, his lean, blackly comic result is transcendent only in fits and starts, stripping away much of its thematic and emotional heft into one of the most frustratingly accomplished disappointments this year."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,40,"To its credit, Spike Lee’s remake isn’t a slavish imitation. On the other hand, its grit is a grey substitute for the original’s vision and verve. Disappointing."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,40,"This one has its technical virtues, but it’s frankly kind of a muddle, and may have been doomed from the outset. I would divide the potential audience for Oldboy into two groups: Those who will be disappointed and those who will be bewildered."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,40,"From Lee’s point of view, I can understand the enticing challenge of taking on a revered cult film Oldboy. But a pair of ill-conceived casting choices can jolt you out of the film, or worse, elicit the rolling of eyes and barely stifled giggle."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,40,"This is a very confused movie, designed for an audience that doesn’t exist."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,39,"A slumming Spike Lee is still better than most directors at the top of their game, but Oldboy isn’t just Lee’s worst movie, it’s practically his “Wicker Man”."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,38,"The sheer brutality of Oldboy is stunning, especially a deeply disturbing scene in which Brolin tortures Samuel L. Jackson. But this is an unrelievedly grim and hermetic experience throughout, the cinematic equivalent of blunt trauma."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,38,"What's onscreen feels squeezed, truncated and curiously embalmed. It's got no kick to it."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,38,"The feel-bad movie of the holiday season, Spike Lee’s often-repellent Americanized reimagining of Korean director Chan-Wook Park’s twisty 2004 revenge thriller Oldboy is relentlessly gruesome, self-consciously shocking and pretty much pointless."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,38,The revenge in Oldboy is neither sweet nor sour; it's just drab.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,38,"Spike Lee's version loses the one thing that really worked in the original, the sense of moral complication emerging out of the intertwined action of two men hell-bent on retribution."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,30,"His (Lee) Oldboy is relentlessly unpleasant and difficult to watch, without offering audiences much moral or aesthetic payoff for its hour and 40 minutes of graphic violence and abject degradation. Oldboy is both original and uncompromising, I’ll give it that—it just doesn’t happen to be any good."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,30,"Lee and Protosevich have made a picture that, although several shades edgier than the average Hollywood thriller, feels content to shadow its predecessor’s every move while falling short of its unhinged, balls-out delirium."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,20,"Other than sniggering about what an outré stereotype they’ve served up, it’s hard to see how Lee and Copley can justify this performance, which is quite the worst of the year, and sends the whole final act of their movie straight to oblivion."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,10,"Colorless and soulless in the extreme, it bears no one's fingerprints at all. There's no reason for this Oldboy to exist. It's so DOA, you stumble out of it wanting to eat something alive."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,0,"The longer it drags on, the sillier it gets. A preposterous narrative, illogical red herrings, trick endings, bad acting and—shazam! — Spike Lee turns into M. Night Shyamalan!"
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,80,"Juicy, adroit, and likable."
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,80,"This brilliantly naive, low-budget shoot-'em-up presents every action as if it were brand spanking new."
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,78,"While the story may be a common one (for the action genre, at least), Rodriguez, who wrote, produced, shot and edited the entire film himself, has a uniquely straightforward wit that makes what might otherwise have been just another shoot-'em-up something more than that."
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,75,Enormously entertaining.
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,75,"A gripping, tautly-paced action flick that outdoes most of Hollywood's similar output. This is clear evidence that film quality often has little to do with a production's budget."
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,70,"Mythic pulp has its allure, and it also has its limitations. El Mariachi displays no real emotion except a profound appreciation for the genre film making that has inspired it, and a delight in manipulating the elements of such stories."
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,70,"The unrelenting tempo is bolstered by Rodriguez's camera work and editing: nearly every frame seems to have been shot with a careening, handheld camera, and they're cut together in a skillful, fluid fashion that enhances the tension and pace of the 80-minute chase."
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,70,"Spanish lingo crime meller has a verve and cheekiness that's partly a smart wedding of such influences as Sergio Leone, George Miller and south-of-the-border noir."
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,67,"Rodriguez makes the same mistake as other first-time auteurs: The world of this movie exists only in relation to other movies, particularly the Sergio Leone-Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns of the early '60s."
Tang ren jie tan an 2,6.1,1983984,70,"Writer-director Chen Sicheng dials the original’s lewd humor down a notch, but still mines stereotypes for easy laughs with Wang delivering his trademark high pitch comedic star turn."
Tang ren jie tan an 2,6.1,1983984,63,"Even if it's not that funny, Detective Chinatown 2 proves to be snappy and persistent, complementing its bright color palette and energy with basic goals to alternate between silly, dark and slightly clever."
Tang ren jie tan an 2,6.1,1983984,50,"This dizzy sequel can’t match any of the first “Detective Chinatown” action highlights, such as the food fight at Bangkok’s floating market. Here’s hoping the third outing, which will take the main characters to Tokyo, returns to the amiable, artful high jinks of the first."
Tang ren jie tan an 2,6.1,1983984,50,"The pace is quick, very quick by American standards. The script blasts through reams of plot with lightning dialogue, and even if you have a fast eye for subtitles you may come to the end of the movie with no clear idea what happened."
Tang ren jie tan an 2,6.1,1983984,40,"The sequel’s worst enemy is its lead actor Wang Baoqiang, who dials up his bumbling, bragging and vulgar persona Tang Ren to intolerable levels."
Jake Speed,5.3,1943751,70,Jake Speed is fun - a deliberately mindless adventure that keeps tongue firmly in cheek.
Jake Speed,5.3,1943751,60,"It has a lively start and finish, but the middle could use less talk and more action--which is not to say it couldn't do with a much lower body count as well. Indeed, were it not for a big dollop of gratuitous violence, it would be more diverting and better crafted than most of the stuff filling up the screen in anticipation of the rest of the summer blockbusters."
Jake Speed,5.3,1943751,50,"Although the film fails at a number of levels, most acutely in never making us care much about any of the characters or their problems, it possesses a loopy charm that makes it a pleasure to watch."
Jake Speed,5.3,1943751,50,"Most of the possibilities for humor or tension, either sexual or dramatic, are badly botched by the flat performances of the other lead actors and the consistent bad timing of the director - everything misfires or misconnects, leaving too many long, dead moments that prove that even an adventure film with lots of running and shooting can be boring."
Jake Speed,5.3,1943751,50,"Crawford plays Speed with his foot in his mouth rather than tongue-in-cheek, and instead of glorying in the experiences of the pulp novel dialogue, dissipates all the comic potential by his evident bewilderment."
Jake Speed,5.3,1943751,40,Jake Speed isn't a movie. It's just a financial deal.
State of Grace,7.3,1911542,80,The movie is so sincere and confused in its values that it mirrors the goofy loyalties and violent pathology of its characters.
State of Grace,7.3,1911542,75,"The movie has been shot with a pleasingly overripe visual flair, and on its own terms it’s fairly entertaining. Yet it isn’t about anything so much as its own explosiveness."
State of Grace,7.3,1911542,75,"With coolly expressive cinematography by Jordan Cronenweth and an insinuating Ennio Morricone score, State of Grace has a somber and chilling tone that is only occasionally breached."
State of Grace,7.3,1911542,75,"The movie is marred by overkill, especially in the brutal and bloated allegorical ending, which feels lifted, clumsily, from The Godfather. State of Grace is most powerful and gripping when it stays true to the emotions of its characters."
State of Grace,7.3,1911542,75,"Visually, State of Grace joins Miller's Crossing as one of the best-looking movies in ages. But, as it nears its bloody ending, the film just gets dumber and dumber."
State of Grace,7.3,1911542,75,"State of Grace is a handsomely produced, mostly riveting, but ultimately overlong and overindulgent gangster picture."
State of Grace,7.3,1911542,70,"Unfortunately, what director Joanou makes of all these promising elements is thudding pretentiousness."
State of Grace,7.3,1911542,63,"The blarney and bohunkery builds to a shaky apex of nothingness, then ends with a slaughter in slo-motion, a romantic ode of blood, bullets and body parts."
Amsal,7.3,1904682,80,"A sensationally entertaining mash-up of historical drama, “Dirty Dozen” style shoot-‘em-up, spaghetti Western-flavored flamboyance, and extended action setpieces that suggest a dream-team collaboration of Sergio Leone, John Woo and Steven Spielberg."
Amsal,7.3,1904682,70,"The director nimbly orchestrates to entertaining effect this mass game of cat-and-mouse populated by paid and unpaid assassins, double agents and even the proverbial twins separated at birth."
Amsal,7.3,1904682,70,Assassination has sprinkles of wit and a nicely restrained anchor in Lee Jung-jae.
Amsal,7.3,1904682,60,"While the director unleashes his taut action sequences like clockwork, he's less deft in handling the characterizations and the decade-leaping plot, which seems designed to provide the film with some historical weight."
Amsal,7.3,1904682,60,Assassination is a blast whenever the director doesn't take his melodramatic plot too seriously.
Amsal,7.3,1904682,50,"With so much focus on spectacle, the film fails to explore this part of Korean history in any meaningful way. Assassination plays more to Choi’s strengths - witty dialogue and entertaining storytelling accompanied by strong visuals and cast."
Death Wish V: The Face of Death,4.8,1702394,75,"Although this entry is competently directed, the series seems to have lost the zip and flashes of wit that made the first Death Wish so memorably repellent."
Death Wish V: The Face of Death,4.8,1702394,40,"Slackly paced and unexciting, Death Wish V comes off as a flat-footed, by-the-numbers programmer that, judging from what’s onscreen, failed to spark much enthusiasm among the people who made it."
Death Wish V: The Face of Death,4.8,1702394,30,An appropriately absurd finale for a series that long ago went over the top.
Death Wish V: The Face of Death,4.8,1702394,25,"Grecian Formula and body corsets notwithstanding, Bronson looks like one of those sculpted potato heads and moves with appropriate grace. This is not the face of death; it's the face of old."
Death Wish V: The Face of Death,4.8,1702394,25,"Even though its characters tote cellular phones and live in ultramodern high-rise apartments, the film still has a sleazy 1970's ambiance. And while Mr. Bronson goes through the motions of revenge with his characteristic deliberation, he looks puffy and sounds terminally bored."
Lao pao er,7.1,1415450,75,"A viewer might expect the film’s widescreen, busy images to fill with revenge-action sequences. But in its own way, Mr. Six is much more about a unique man adjusting an out-of-fashion personal code for a new type of crisis in the shadow of his mortality."
Lao pao er,7.1,1415450,70,"Scored to a beautiful, introspection-oriented saxophone score, Mr. Six surprises by attempting to delve behind Feng’s sometime-inscrutable facade, rather than pushing its leading man toward action."
Lao pao er,7.1,1415450,70,"Staying just on the serious side of funny, Feng’s Mr Six is a fine, savoury creation."
Lao pao er,7.1,1415450,60,Where Guan excels is in straight dramatization.
Lao pao er,7.1,1415450,58,"Plotted with limited imagination and directed with atypical flatness, Mr. Six features a strong central performance and shares its humanistic concern with Hu Guan’s previous work but is nevertheless an artistic underachiever."
Lao pao er,7.1,1415450,40,"The baggy 137-minute story drowns out Mr. Feng’s assorted sharp moments with hoary family drama and clumsy plotting, and Li Yifeng is generic as Mr. Six’s son."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,75,"In his feature film debut, Little uses washed-out color and a you-are-there immediacy to tell a powerful wartime tale of survival, morality and honor."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,75,"Saints and Soldiers isn't a great film, but what it does, it does well."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,75,"It's no earthshaker, but the indie film is refreshingly different from the current movie norm, it's won more than 15 awards on the festival circuit, and war-movie aficionados will find it well worth the journey."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,70,"Well mounted, frequently gripping."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,70,"The triumph here is a matter of craftsmanship rather than art, but it's rare enough even on that level for a film to be worth celebrating."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,70,"Thanks to an impressive cast of largely unknown actors, this small-scale, meticulously researched film tells its story with quiet conviction."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,70,"Inspired by actual events, Saints and Soldiers benefits by being a small-scale war movie."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,70,"Director-cinematographer Ryan Little neatly ratchets up the suspense while throwing emotional spotlights on the inner struggles of each combatant trapped in this hostile, frozen wilderness."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,63,"Wants to be an epic in the mold of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but it's hindered by its modest budget."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,63,"For a certain kind of moviegoer, Saints and Soldiers provides above-average nostalgia. Others, more hardened, might call it child's play."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,50,Shackles its characters with stale dialogue straight out of decades-old Sgt. Rock comic books.
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,50,"Too often, Saints And Soldiers confuses bravery for faith."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,50,"There's an uplifting message about heroism, dispensed in dialogue so familiar you can practically lip=synch it."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,40,"The thin backstory hints at a conflict between the religious convictions of the hero (helpfully named Deacon) and the demands of combat, but it never fully materializes; as it is, we mainly know that he's a Mormon because he doesn't smoke or drink coffee."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,40,"Despite all the life-threatening situations, warrior deaths and heroic feats, it's hard to get behind characters who feel like lazy archetypes."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,40,That the film seems willing to erect a simple religious parable on such a moral morass is bewildering. That it should do so without accurately depicting the nightmare of Hitler's Europe is unconscionable.
8 Million Ways to Die,5.7,1305114,75,It’s a fine swan song for Ashby.
8 Million Ways to Die,5.7,1305114,60,"The plot doesn’t make much sense, but the film is filled with lovely little moments courtesy of Bridges, who brings a casualness to this character
that feels right."
8 Million Ways to Die,5.7,1305114,50,"What could have been a better film delving into complexities of one tough-but-vulnerable alcoholic sheriff out to bust a cocaine ring, instead ends up an oddly-paced work that is sometimes a thriller and sometimes a love story, succeeding at neither."
8 Million Ways to Die,5.7,1305114,40,"What happened? With Ashby, Bridges, Arquette and a script co-written by Oliver Stone, you expect the result to be better than a long drawn-out episode of The Equalizer."
8 Million Ways to Die,5.7,1305114,30,"8 Million Ways to Die is a ponderous, convoluted improbability, with more inexplicable actions and situations than ""The Big Sleep,"" which is the last time those two films will ever be mentioned in the same sentence."
8 Million Ways to Die,5.7,1305114,30,"Considering the major talents involved here, one would expect to find something more than a run-of-the-mill crime thriller. In a sense one does, for 8 MILLION WAYS TO DIE is a paralyzingly inept film."
8 Million Ways to Die,5.7,1305114,30,HOW did Eight Million Ways to Die commit suicide? Let us count the ways.
Xun Long Jue,6,1243810,70,"Though the film lacks the spooky, macabre spirit expected of this subterranean subgenre, Mongolian-Chinese helmer Wuershan (“Painted Skin II:  The Resurrection”) applies his outlandish visual panache to evoke an underground world of ethnic antiquity refreshingly distinct from traditional Han-Chinese culture."
Xun Long Jue,6,1243810,70,The charismatic performers — who include Angelababy as a woman at the center of a past love triangle with the two male leads — are engaging from start to finish.
Xun Long Jue,6,1243810,60,"While the sub-par effects make it difficult to become fully immersed in the tomb raiding exploits of the Mojin, the rivalries, romances and camaraderie between the central trio do hold water and help sustain the film’s forward momentum."
Xun Long Jue,6,1243810,40,What starts eerie becomes strictly cartoonish.
Xun Long Jue,6,1243810,38,"Come for the murky action, and stay for the shudder-inducing feeling of nostalgia for Mao's Cultural Revolution. It's a very odd movie, indeed."
Xun Long Jue,6,1243810,30,"Embracing the worst of Hollywood excess, director Wuershan crams in enough CG effects to fill a dozen Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay features, but the uninspired payoff quickly grows tiresome."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,100,"An intense, powerful film."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,89,"The most costly and the most popular film in South Korean history is also one of the most gripping and epic war films ever made, and certainly the only one I can think of the portrays the Korean war from the viewpoint of both sides of the conflict."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,88,"Belongs to that brand of sweeping, conflict-era drama epitomized by ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Gone with the Wind"" and TV miniseries ""North and South."""
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,80,A complex film about the minefield of loyalty and betrayal.
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,75,An anti-war spectacle that uses the story of brothers divided by the 1950 civil war as a metaphor for the wounds of the split.
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,75,"Always entertains, just like ''Pearl Harbor'' and the rest of the best of Hollywood's dumb war movies."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,70,"While it comes on like a flag-waver, it actually delivers something more nuanced. Its underlying skepticism about the Korean War seems to have jibed with the current national mood: The picture was, deservedly, a huge hit."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,70,"With killing as an end in itself, combatants lose sight of what they were supposed to be taking up arms for in the first place. It's a terrible lesson, and one that Tae Guk Gi teaches with unexpected confidence."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,70,"The cloying score aside, this is a searing depiction of war in all its savagery, waste, and folly, with artfully choreographed sequences that surpass the conventions of the genre."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,70,You may find some of the story developments melodramatic -- I did -- but the film itself is quite powerful.
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,63,"Shamelessly contrived and manipulative, Tae Guk Gi packs a visceral wallop."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,63,It's hard to remain unmoved by Kang's deeply heartfelt homage to his nation's past.
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,63,The film is never as powerful or convincing as it should be.
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,60,"In the rare moments when a rifle, grenade, howitzer, bayonet, dagger, fist, land mine, or flamethrower isn't being deployed, the film pushes its melodramatic plotline with soap operatic shamelessness."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,60,"Far more ambivalent and ambiguous film than Mr. Spielberg's. Both North and South are portrayed as brutal, abusive regimes that use their citizens as so much cannon fodder."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,60,"It's easy to view the story of these brothers as a larger metaphor for the relationship between the two Koreas, which gives the film an added resonance that your typical Hollywood war movie wouldn't possess."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,50,"Kang remains a superb technician, but somewhere the movie forgot to pack any genuine emotion along with its ordnance and K rations."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,50,"After a sentimental opening sequence, he (Kang) scarcely lets the film pause to breathe, which dulls its effectiveness."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,25,Almost entirely devoted to combat violence and sentimental interludes.
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,75,"After a devastating opening, the movie gets sluggish here and there, but it remains interesting throughout, not just culturally, but as a piece of drama."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,70,It is a strange cross-breed between an old-fashioned WWII epic full of genre cliches and a modern update whose meticulous historical recreation is frighteningly real.
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,70,"Lush with feeling that could easily be mistaken for sentimentality, Stalingrad is more like a 19th-century novel than a 21st-century blockbuster. It's theatrical and intense, sometimes in an overbearing way, but it's never boring."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,67,Stalingrad is a 3-D epic that's one-dimensional.
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,63,"It's a mixed bag overall — hence my star rating — but it's worth seeing nonetheless, largely because of the explicitly Russian qualities its sustains."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,63,"In detail and combat spectacle, Stalingrad is hard to beat. And whatever its failings, one can’t help but be curious about a story as connected to national identity as this one, a film that like today’s Russia, feels more Soviet than Russian."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,60,"Though plenty of road-tested war truths about sacrifice, honor, grit and intimacy get trotted out, ""Stalingrad"" is deep down a spectacle campaign forged in operatic violence and a siege of the senses, and on those terms it has its moments."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,60,"Hollywood does this too; truth be told, Russia’s high-tech whitewash goes down smooth like vodka."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,60,"A solid enough war flick, but Spielberg doesn’t have too much to worry about yet."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,55,"If you're only going to see one film about the Battle of Stalingrad — and there are many — Stalingrad would be the wrong choice. Russian director Fedor Bondarchuk's treatment of the World War II turning point is shallow and contrived, if sometimes impressively staged."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,50,"Viewed as cinema, it’s an unstable and almost surrealist combination of Soviet-style war propaganda film, Zack Snyder-style action flick and sentimental fairy tale."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,50,"While the imagery in this retelling is impeccable, the story is strangely lifeless."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,50,"As quickly as the technical elements pull the audience in, the plot pushes us away."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,50,"Overall, Stalingrad is a bizarre concoction, part Putin-era patriotic chest-thumping and part creaky war melodrama, all set in a superbly recreated ruined city."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,50,"The film calms down a bit in its second half, leaving more room for Bondarchuk’s striking wartime tableaux, making occasional use of its native 3-D cinematography. (The movie, a massive success in Russia last year, will screen primarily in IMAX 3D venues in the U.S.)"
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,50,It’s a brutal bit of screen poetry that’s matched too infrequently by the aching human stories director Fedor Bondarchuk is so anxious to tell.
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,50,"Unfortunately, as in Bay’s “Pearl Harbor,’’ much of the sometimes draggy 2 1/4 hours is given to clichéd inspirational drama."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,40,"The movie’s few spectacles — particularly the composite image of Russian soldiers aflame after a fuel depot explodes — seem to consume the creative energies of the filmmakers, with their palpable pride in staging patriotic deaths from the safe distance of history."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,40,Bondarchuk mingles the you-are-there grittiness of close-quarters combat and constant assaults from above and below with war-movie clichés that haven’t been updated since before the real Battle Of Stalingrad. It’s history written with airbrush.
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,40,"The macho showmanship of director Fyodor Bondarchuk, wedded to such a facile script, turns this undeniably impressive megaproduction into a behemoth you mainly want to cower from."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,40,"When the best one can say about a movie is that it’s pyrotechnically impressive, something important is missing. In this case it’s tension, originality and memorable characters."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,38,"Its blind reverence toward the Russian mythos is so grandiose that it becomes impossible to rescue it from self-importance, and as such President Putin would likely give it two big thumbs up."
Stalingrad,5.6,1013945,30,"Assaults are filmed in ubiquitous slow-mo to better register the way bodies are thrown into the air. It’s all rather confusing, actually, since the monochromatic tonalities and weak script, lacking in any comprehensible battle strategy, tend to meld the two sides together."

Chandni Chowk to China,4,921738,50,"It will appeal to the large Indian audiences in North America and to Bollywood fans in general, who will come out wondering why this movie, of all movies, was chosen as Hollywood's first foray into commercial Indian cinema."

Chandni Chowk to China,4,921738,50,"At two hours and 34 minutes, CC2C is too much by a half: too much dancing and fighting and too much footage of the Great Wall of China. It does, however, have a vulgar energy and many of the jokes work."
Chandni Chowk to China,4,921738,42,"A more accurate way to describe it would be ""conceptual nightmare""--crass, schizophrenic, culturally insensitive, horribly paced, and shameless in its pandering to the lowest common denominator."
Chandni Chowk to China,4,921738,40,"As with many a Bollywood epic, you can bring the kids, your lunch, your cell phone, your unfiled taxes. There's so much here, and in such heaping, lengthy portions, you could probably weave a sari before the end credits."
Chandni Chowk to China,4,921738,40,"It's a live-action Looney Tunes cartoon that lasts 154 minutes rather than just five, and it's as exhausting as it sounds."

Dodookdeul,6.8,685839,70,"While the movie's second half feels more consequential - and more impressively action-packed - than its first part, it also loses some of its initial charm and quirk via a protracted, often dizzying descent into a kind of booty-centric game of hot potato."
Dodookdeul,6.8,685839,70,"Easier to like than it is to follow, Choi Dong-hoon's glossy caper boasts all the pomp and cajolery of the true international blockbuster."
Dodookdeul,6.8,685839,63,"A dazzling heist film that can't help but come off as duly influenced by Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's trilogy, South Korea's number one box-office champ of all time is never less than clever."

Chi bi,7.4,627047,88,"Red Cliff is a dichotomous beast: The computer-generated imagery that makes so much of it possible is served up in heaping, state-of-the-art portions, but the results occasionally border on the cartoonish. At the same time, Red Cliff is a classic tale that gets a classicist's treatment."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,83,The spectacular battle scenes are the engorged heart of the delirious adventure. But Woo also gets maximum romantic value from Tony Leung as a war hero married to Chiling Lin as the tea-pouring beauty.

Chi bi,7.4,627047,80,"Balances character, grit, spectacle and visceral action in a meaty, dramatically satisfying pie that delivers on the hype and will surprise many who felt the Hong Kong helmer progressively lost his mojo during his long years stateside."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,80,"Red Cliff exudes a physical grandiosity that few movies of the past 20 years have attempted--no matter that Woo, even at his best, is still more at ease with down-and-dirty action than epic pageantry."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,80,It's a movie on the Hollywood scale that has so much of the Asian spirit. It has drawn the Asian audience back to the movie theater.
Chi bi,7.4,627047,75,A scrumptious war movie.
Chi bi,7.4,627047,75,"As expected, it has gaping holes where back stories used to be. Still, it's a historical war movie with impressive sweep, strong characterizations and the kind of idiosyncratic flourishes that made Woo such an irresistible storyteller."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,75,"We are reminded: War is hell. But at their best, war movies can be cool and beautiful."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,70,"Any war picture in which the heroine stalls the villain with a quiet, painstaking tea ceremony until the wind shifts direction and the good guys can firebomb the bad guys into oblivion is too ineffably Zen not to love."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,70,"A prelude that provides the beams and columns for the narrative framework, but with a few decisive and spot-on action spectacles, it sufficiently kindles expectations for the climactic clash in Part 2."

Chi bi,7.4,627047,70,"Returning to his roots after a stint in Hollywood, Woo has made the most expensive film in mainland Chinese history, a pleasantly traditional picture that marks a new direction for one of the world's premier action maestros."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,67,"The film is both traditional and modern: austere in its engagement with history, and insistent in its showy action beats."

Below,6.2,605562,63,"A movie where the story, like the sub, sometimes seems to be running blind. In its best moments it can evoke fear, and it does a good job of evoking the claustrophobic terror of a little World War II boat."

"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,75,"It's a bewildering mix of very smart and very dumb, but the cast, which also features a hilarious Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei, Dan Aykroyd as the Cheney-esque ex-vice president, and Hilary Duff as a Turaqistan airhead pop star, is tiptop."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,70,"Like so many satires in the Strangelove mold, this never comes close to working as a story, but its lampoon of U.S. imperialism and military privatization is so bracingly obnoxious I didn't really care."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,67,"Comes up with some decent jokes, including a talking car-based GPS system which doubles as a therapist, and a suggestive Yonica number titled ""I Want to Blow You Up,"" but fails to surround them with a compelling story or characters who rise above the level of cliche."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,63,"Screwball, vaguely futuristic political satires are a rare hybrid, and War, Inc. is an intriguing, if flawed, example."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,63,"This script bumps along, good ideas jostling with weak, derivative ones, and Seftel doesn't seem to know which way he wants to handle the material. Also, with Cusack playing yet another soul-fried wiseacre running on emotional autopilot, the piece doesn't have much of an engine."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,60,"Somehow, what starts as a series of cheap shots in a barrel develops into something more, thanks largely to warm, engaging performances by Cusack and Tomei. War, Inc. is both right-on and somehow off, but it gets points for trying."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,50,"The trouble with this satirical take US involvement in Iraq, penned by Mark Leyner, John Cusack and Jeremy Pikser, is that the real thing is equally absurd and only marginally less funny."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,50,"Its comedy too often blunders into meaningless slapstick, with bombs and bloodshed replacing pratfalls and pies in the face."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,50,A brave and ambitious but chaotic attempt at political satire.
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,40,"The ambitions and intentions of War, Inc., co-written by and starring John Cusack, are laudable, but the film is a nearly complete misfire."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,40,"A blackly comic take on the first totally outsourced war? We're too close to being in one right now, which makes this John Cusack vehicle too close for comfort. It's also so close to being funny you can just about taste it -- just about."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,40,"Antiwar, anti-Bush, anti-corporate, yet neither as progressive nor half as funny as the ""Harold and Kumar"" sequel, War, Inc. squanders some top-tier talent (Marisa Tomei, Sir Ben Kingsley) as well as our patience."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,40,"Has TOO much happening, which befits a comedy with a lot of targets but ultimately makes the whole operation scattershot."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,38,All that's missing is coherence. Call it Blunderbuss Satire.
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,30,"War, Inc. is gonzo moviemaking with a bleeding heart. A satirical farce that wants to be ""Dr. Strangelove"" for the age of terrorism, it is a zany, nihilistic free-for-all that goes soft."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,30,"War, Inc. is neither all that interesting nor all that cool."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,30,"A film that, in attempting to ridicule the Bush administration, finally just settles for being ridiculous itself."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,25,"The overall experience is manic, juvenile, and hit-or-miss, as if the auteurs behind ""Epic Movie"" were trying to remake ""Wag The Dog."" It's too soon to laugh about Iraq, and it'll never be time to laugh about it with this kind of maladroit humor."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,25,Misfires so severely that even the clever details get obliterated in the resulting mess.
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,20,Sorry excuse for political satire.
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,12,"The movie has two modes - very loud and extremely loud - and all of the actors are encouraged to mug their hearts out. That even includes Cusack's real-life sister Joan, normally one of the most reliable performers in the business."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8,515905,100,"There are gripping chases and balletic combat scenes, painstakingly realised by Oshii’s animators, but the mood is mostly cold and melancholic, as Kusanagi broods over the fleshly implications of living in a world of data"
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8,515905,88,"Technically, Ghost in the Shell is astonishing, not only for its smooth meld of cell animation and state-of-the-art computer animation, but also for its imaginative storytelling and mood-setting (thanks to an eerie, non-thumping score by Kenji Kawai)."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8,515905,88,"For a movie that’s so photo-realistic in its backgrounds and detailed in its character design, Ghost In The Shell is just as effective when it goes minimal, suggesting presence through absence."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8,515905,88,"The plot is impossibly dense and the characters – perhaps appropriately – feel like little more than cyphers, but for sheer mind-expanding sci-fi strangeness this is hard to beat."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8,515905,80,"It is a dizzying, headspinning film, replete with violence, alienation and tech-porn. I confess I find it too opaque to make the kind of investment that would qualify me as a real fan. But it should be seen."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8,515905,80,"Most alluring are the crumbling neon cityscapes, real world/cyberspace fusion and the musings on identity."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8,515905,80,"From its baddie-eviscerating opening sequence through innumerable car chases, shoot outs and tongue-in-cheek dialogue exchanges, this is exactly the kind of film that James Cameron would make if they ever let him through the Disney front gates."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8,515905,80,"The ghost of anime can be seen here trying to dive into the shell of the movie mainstream. But this particular film is too complex and murky to reach a large audience, I suspect; it's not until the second hour that the story begins to reveal its meaning. But I enjoyed its visuals, its evocative soundtrack (including a suite for percussion and heavy breathing), and its ideas."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8,515905,80,Mamoru Oshii's direction deftly merges gritty realism with a dreamlike quality. The only problem is that the characters reel off their existential speeches with such harried deadpan that it's hard to tell whether the angst is serious or tongue-in-cheek.
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8,515905,75,Oshii is able to knit together action sequences with extraordinary power and conviction.... Ghost in the Shell is absolutely terrific.
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8,515905,75,"Less spectacular but more effectively atmospheric than Akira, Ghost in the Shell should gratify anime buffs and may well hook the uninitiated."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8,515905,75,Ghost in the Shell is a slick but plodding recycling of tired cyberpunk clichés that adds nothing new to the genre.
Unsullied,4.3,510957,70,"It's almost inconceivable that this effective, nerve-racking thriller is the first feature from former NFL defensive end Simeon Rice. It requires the usual suspension of disbelief, and pacing problems are a sign of Rice's directorial inexperience. But the tension he creates is unrelenting."
Unsullied,4.3,510957,60,"This B-movie, reminiscent of '70s era grindhouse fare, is a reasonably proficient and professional debut that fulfills its modest aspirations."
Unsullied,4.3,510957,38,Unsullied was made by a director with real promise. It's a shame Rice picked this turkey to shoot as his first
Unsullied,4.3,510957,30,"The actors, including Erin Boyes as another captive, try to infuse their characters with depth, and the cinematographer, Scott Winig, lends the proceedings a professional gloss, especially in nighttime scenes. But their efforts cannot lift the story beyond its thin, lurid premise."
Unsullied,4.3,510957,12,"Unsullied is wholly underwhelming, with atrocious performances and plot twists so implausible that they would be funny in a film less tedious than this."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,100,"Detective Dee is the action flick of the year, a two-hour epic that blows the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" to the Bermuda Triangle."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,100,"The pulp-fictional hero is inhabited by the charismatic Andy Lau who, together with Chinese stars Bingbing Li, Ms. Lau and Tony Leung Ka-fai, makes Detective Dee the most purely entertaining film of our vanishing summer."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,100,"The movie is not just spectacle; it's got a tender, ultimately tragic love story and enough deadly political scheming to fill a Gaddafi playbook. Indeed, in its narrative cunning, luscious production design and martial-arts balletics, Detective Dee is up there with the first great kung-fu art film, King Hu's 1969 ""A Touch of Zen."" We'd call it ""Crouching Tiger, Freakin' Masterpiece."""
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,90,"It has opulent, stylized settings of elegance, grandeur and scope, flawless special effects, and awesome martial arts combat staged by the master, Sammo Hung. Yet bravura spectacle never overwhelms either the plot or the key characters. Chang Chia-lu's intricate script bristles with wit and suspense; the film from start to finish is a terrific entertainment."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,88,"On the basis of its scale, energy and magical events, this is the Hong Kong equivalent of a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster. But it transcends them with the stylization of the costumes, the panoply of the folklore, the richness of the setting, and the fact that none of the characters (allegedly) have superpowers."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,85,"I've seen Detective Dee twice now, and I still don't think I've taken the full measure of the visual nuttiness, and lushness, Tsui has packed in there."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,80,"Andy Lau (Infernal Affairs) gives a charismatic lead performance as Dee, a historical figure who became a folk hero, but the real attraction is Tsui's giddy imagination."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,80,"Witty but not campy, grand without being unduly somber, it is a crazy, almost-coherent riot of intrigue, color and kineticism anchored by the charisma of its cast."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,80,"Magnificent and cheesy, the latest and most proudly absurd of Chinese historical spectaculars, Detective Dee is a cinematic comic book for people who are sick of the mode."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,75,"In their best moments, Hark's action movies have a what-did-I-just-see giddiness, as if their choreography were springing straight from a cartoon id. Though I could have done without much of the film's CGI-heavy fakery, ""Detective Dee"" finds that giddiness more than a few times."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,75,"A historical epic with elements of wu xia, supernatural thrillers, and drawing-room murder mysteries."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,75,"While there's a casual dissonance to each twist in its winding plot that results in a disconnected and emotionally vapid experience, Detective Dee unquestionably achieves the escapism it intends."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,75,Hark's new film is a consummately bizarre crowd-pleaser that throws everything at the viewer from makeshift plastic surgery by acupuncture to death by spontaneous combustion.
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,70,A CG-steeped period-piece fantasy that weds whodunit drama and punch-and-kick mayhem.
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,70,"Although it lacks the historical aura of classic Chinese wuxia backdrops, James Chiu's post-""Avatar"" production design is memorably imaginative."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,70,"An inventive marriage of ancient China and Agatha Christie, Detective Dee and the Mystery of Phantom Flame is a lavishly overwrought historical whodunit."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,63,"It's slambang in pacing, bald in exposition, and offers cast-of-hundreds spectacle."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,60,"If you can ignore the implausibility -- nay, the opacity -- of the plot, the film is wonderfully cinematic, with great photography, exciting editing, fresh camera angles and some impressive CGI."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,60,"To maximize your entertainment budget, look no further."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,60,"As the Sherlock Holmes of the second Zhou Dynasty, Lau is so effortlessly appealing that he manages to anchor the fatigue-heavy proceedings, even when his character has to outrun both the rays of the sun - don't ask - and a collapsing statue while crawling over and under a pack of stampeding horses. Now that's star power."
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,50,A lightweight but enjoyable yarn.
Di renjie: Tong tian di guo,6.6,459836,50,"Pure escapist hokum, with action choreography by Sammo Hung, but I sure miss that old-school wire work."

3 Ninjas Knuckle Up,4.2,407618,70,"The martial-arts sequences are zesty, a description that applies to this well-crafted movie as a whole."
3 Ninjas Knuckle Up,4.2,407618,42,While the third film has a little more narrative coherence—involving corporate pollution on a Native American tribe’s land—it’s also lazy in a way that’s hard to look past.
3 Ninjas Knuckle Up,4.2,407618,38,"There’s barely enough plot for a half-hour episode of a weekly TV series spinoff. And there’s even less here in terms of acting, writing and filmmaking polish to appeal to anyone over the age of 10."
3 Ninjas Knuckle Up,4.2,407618,30,"Grown-ups will come away feeling violated by the film's clumsy comedy, ancient plot, and unimaginative action sequences."

3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,375805,58,"The incredible silliness doesn’t quite erase the bad taste of this kid’s movie featuring an implied dozen civilian casualties, but it helps."
3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,375805,50,"Pathetic yet stupidly entertaining for several minutes of its interminable running time, 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain makes half its cast look like retreads and half like fresh ponies desperately karate-kicking a dud script to see if it has any signs of life."
3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,375805,40,"For most moviegoers over 12, this, the fourth Three Ninjas movie, will be interminably boring. But it's possible that young children will enjoy the film, since it falls into both the action category and the children-are-smart-adults-can't-do-anything-right genre."
3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,375805,38,Only small children with limited attention spans will be impressed by the lackluster kung-foolishness in 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain.

Gong fu yu jia,5.2,362657,70,"A good-natured cross-cultural romp in which you can barely be expected to take any human interaction seriously, save for those in which humans smack up against each other with force."
Gong fu yu jia,5.2,362657,70,Kung Fu Yoga is a proudly silly cultural melting pot in which kung fu and Bollywood meet amicably.
Gong fu yu jia,5.2,362657,60,"As the leading man, Chan keeps the ball rolling with an assortment of neat acrobatic tricks and martial arts sparring, but his days of life-risking physical exertion is over."
Gong fu yu jia,5.2,362657,60,"By the time it all culminates in a Chan-led classic Bollywood production number, the cuteness factor may have been pushed to its limit, but good luck trying to stop that goofy smile from spreading across your face."
Gong fu yu jia,5.2,362657,58,"The absence of necessity or consistency has its appeal; it guarantees that the movie stays unpredictable even as it pilfers shamelessly, piling cliché upon cliché, but rarely in a way that makes a lick of sense."
Gong fu yu jia,5.2,362657,50,"A lively closing dance sequence, after an earnest, underwhelming climax, pays affectionate tribute to Bollywood production numbers. But you won’t find Mr. Chan’s customary bloopers over the closing credits."
Gong fu yu jia,5.2,362657,50,The movie’s best bits come when Tong’s script eases up on banter and clunky Indy homages and instead simply indulges in random zaniness.
Gong fu yu jia,5.2,362657,50,"An amiable, average-at-best caper-like quest remains just that, even with recognisable talent, and even more so when its combination of elements is clearly stretched."
Gong fu yu jia,5.2,362657,25,"Kung Fu Yoga doesn't feel like a young man's film. Normally that would be a cause for celebration, but in this case, Chan's latest doesn't just address, but rather shows his age."
Kill Me Again,6.3,283694,75,The tale of a down-and-out detective and a seamy femme fatale is a thoroughly professional little entertainment.
Kill Me Again,6.3,283694,75,"Kill Me Again doesn't look like the noir classics; instead of black-and-white, it's shot in slightly muddy color with vagrant green tints. But it feels like them. It has that nerve-jangling mix of pungent cynicism and thick gobs of pseudo-Expressionist style. It's not brilliant or original, but it's still a lean, fast, wide-awake sleeper."
Kill Me Again,6.3,283694,70,"Derived from assorted Hitchcocks and noir classics, the tortuous storyline of writer-director Dahl's determinedly sordid thriller has its moments, but the whole thing is fatally scuppered by the Kilmer pairing."
Kill Me Again,6.3,283694,60,"Well-crafted and competently acted, Kill Me Again is anything but a terrible film; however, like so many other films that have struggled mightily to pay homage to the great films noir of the past, it fails to come to life on its own terms."
The Doom Generation,6,259319,80,"Firing on all cylinders for the first time, Araki throws in decapitation, spunk munching, outrageous visual and structural puns, Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss, and a running 666 gag, all in the service of American sexual liberation. Imagine Natural Born Killers with a sense of humour."
The Doom Generation,6,259319,78,"More than any other filmmaker making movies about the new “kids” generation, it seems to me that Araki -- with both Doom and Totally F***ked Up -- has his finger tuned most acutely to the human pulse and not just the lens shutter."
The Doom Generation,6,259319,75,"Doom Generation is an 85-minute, darkly comic assault on the audience, laden with satirically over-the-top (and below-the-belt) violence, unending profanity and enough references to the posterior to fill a proctologic encyclopedia. Araki wants to serve up the sleaziest, crudest fare he can dream up. His efforts can only be described as successful."
The Doom Generation,6,259319,75,It’s a savagely funny ride fueled by Araki’s insight and blunt compassion.
The Doom Generation,6,259319,75,"Ultimately, The Doom Generation succeeds on its old-fashioned virtues - cinematography, acting, script, storytelling, individual vision. Plenty of films have dealt with teen isolation and many more will pile on the shocks, but few have a script this hilarious or a visual sensibility this developed."
The Doom Generation,6,259319,75,"A nihilistic comedy about a trio of alienated youngsters, pic is bold not only in its art design, but also in its narrative and tone, a mixture of satire and horror with heavy dosage of steamy sex and macabre violence."
The Doom Generation,6,259319,75,"As a stylish black comedy its uncompromising nature should be applauded, though as an indictment of the hopelessly violent American society, the message gets lost."
The Doom Generation,6,259319,70,"Striking to look at, though often offensively opportunistic, this mainly comes across as a throwaway shocker with energy to spare. There's not much thought in evidence though."
The Doom Generation,6,259319,63,It makes you wonder when Araki is going to find something else to think about.
The Doom Generation,6,259319,60,For the terminally hip and/or terminally adolescent.
The Doom Generation,6,259319,50,"In short, it's about as charming as a gob of spit."
The Doom Generation,6,259319,50,Good luck searching for meaning — you’ll find mostly blood and epithets.
The Doom Generation,6,259319,50,"This is the kind of movie where the filmmaker hopes to shock you with sickening carnage and violent amorality, while at the same time holding himself carefully aloof from it with his style. He would be more honest and probably make a better movie if he got down in the trenches with the rest of us."
Blood: The Last Vampire,5.3,257412,75,"This isn't a great movie. But it's sincere as an entertainment, it looks good, it's atmospheric, and I will perk up the next time I hear Gianna is in a picture."
Blood: The Last Vampire,5.3,257412,50,"The mixed-gene pool of talent doesn't quite jell, but a saving grace is Korean sweetheart Jeon Ji-hyun."
Blood: The Last Vampire,5.3,257412,42,Gory but dramatically inert vampire schlocker.
Blood: The Last Vampire,5.3,257412,42,Every scrap of footage here has been done better somewhere else.
Blood: The Last Vampire,5.3,257412,40,"While foreign viewers are apt to focus on the action, native English speakers can't help but notice the sheer awkwardness of the performances."
Blood: The Last Vampire,5.3,257412,40,"Blood's only surprise is that the filmmakers landed Gianna (also known as Gianna Jun, or Jeon Ji-hyun) for the lead. The South Korean megastar proves a more-than-capable action heroine, despite the creative detritus around which she has to navigate."
Blood: The Last Vampire,5.3,257412,38,The finale of this tedious piece of Asian-ish action-schlock based on a popular anime series implies an intention to make more. One was plenty for me.
Blood: The Last Vampire,5.3,257412,30,"Suffers from abusive close-ups, repetitive fight sequences and uninspired demon design."
Blood: The Last Vampire,5.3,257412,25,"If only the projectionist could be persuaded to play the first 10 minutes over and over for two hours, this might be a satisfying movie. Unfortunately, the middle and the end feature a weak lead character, choppy fight choreography, humorless dialogue and computer-generated effects that look as if they came from the ""Ghostbusters II"" era."
Blood: The Last Vampire,5.3,257412,25,Weighed down by its plodding mediocrity.
Blood: The Last Vampire,5.3,257412,20,"Flashbacks show samurai shenanigans, but it's all cluttered and rambling. Watch ""True Blood,"" ""Let the Right One In"" or ""Twilight"" instead. Or wait for ""Thirst"" or ""New Moon"" or ""Daybreakers"" or ..."
Blood: The Last Vampire,5.3,257412,10,"Unexciting, incoherent, lamely acted, and carelessly written."
Blood: The Last Vampire,5.3,257412,0,"Not only isn't the new effort up to the standards of the anime, it's bloody awful by any standard."
Zhi qu wei hu shan,6.5,228984,88,"This lavish period piece contains enough thrills, spills and moments of cinematic grace that not only manage to push it through the rough spots but allow it to put most American action films of recent vintage to shame."
Zhi qu wei hu shan,6.5,228984,70,"The film’s strength really lies in its thrilling pace and robust action, elaborately choreographed and executed to involve a large ensemble of characters in a gripping way."
Zhi qu wei hu shan,6.5,228984,70,"The Taking of Tiger Mountain may not always be as grand as it should be, but its thrills compensate for its shortcomings."
Zhi qu wei hu shan,6.5,228984,67,"Boasts a handful of colorful, gonzo set pieces of the kind that made Tsui’s reputation at home and abroad."
Zhi qu wei hu shan,6.5,228984,60,"Tsui will try anything once in 3-D. Splatters of blood travel in bullet-time, and the requisite ridiculousness — like action scenes with skis and zip-lines — characterize Tsui's work. But bookending the story with the 2015-set prologue and epilogue turns out to be his most inspired touch."
Zhi qu wei hu shan,6.5,228984,50,"The movie has a nationalistic, didactic flavor and a tiresome devotion to spectacle. Even the climax is staged two ways."
Zhi qu wei hu shan,6.5,228984,50,A straightforward spectacle motored by relentless high-octane action sequences between simplistic heroes and grotesque villains.
Zhi qu wei hu shan,6.5,228984,38,"Cheery and happily empty-headed, the present-day subplot adds little but sentiment to a film shot through with cliché characters, a predictable plot, and undisguised reverence."
Yip Man 2,7.6,205675,83,"An energetic, witty and altogether well-built martial arts drama that is familiar in many ways but distinguished by its high level of craft, its sincere sentiment and drama, and the forceful charisma of its star, Donnie Yen."
Yip Man 2,7.6,205675,80,"Choreographed by the film martial-arts veteran Sammo Hung, the fights are spectacularly designed and performed, relying more on muscle and skill than wirework."
Yip Man 2,7.6,205675,75,A reminder of the pleasure of classic martial-arts films in which skilled athletes performed many of their own stunts.
Yip Man 2,7.6,205675,70,"Nearly as enjoyable as the original. Its not-so-secret weapon is the poised, calm performance of Yen, who somehow manages to play Ip as both character and archetype."
Yip Man 2,7.6,205675,70,"More slick mainland melodrama than rough-and-ready chop-socky picture, Ip Man 2 often finds itself struggling to reconcile those conflicting impulses between drizzly emotional moments and slap-happy frenzy."
Yip Man 2,7.6,205675,70,A redundant if nonetheless occasionally thrilling follow-up bolstered by star Donnie Yen's precision combat skills.
Yip Man 2,7.6,205675,70,"A superbly well-crafted film, faithful to its cultural and cinematic heritage, and easily one of the most enjoyable entertainments of a still nascent 2011 post-holiday season."
Yip Man 2,7.6,205675,70,"Compared to his stellar hit ""Ip Man"" - a biopic on the Wing Chun master who tutored Bruce Lee - Wilson Yip's more lavishly produced sequel Ip Man 2 is a fistful of hits and misses."
Yip Man 2,7.6,205675,67,"If you're searching for pure, unadulterated fisticuffs joy, you could do far worse than Ip Man 2."
Yip Man 2,7.6,205675,63,"The piéce de résistance is a ""Rocky""-ish battle between bare-fisted Ip (Donnie Yen) and a racist Brit who uses boxing gloves and goes by the name Twister."
Yip Man 2,7.6,205675,60,"With action this strong, the script just needs to be serviceable - and that's exactly what it is."
Yip Man 2,7.6,205675,60,Yip's chop-socky sequel does manage to up the (admittedly modest) ante of the original.
Yip Man 2,7.6,205675,50,"If the movie packs a weaker punch than the original, it has less to do with the action sequences than the script (by Edmond Wong, son of Raymond, who wrote the first), a flimsy affair with subpar villains."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,75,"In place of a rousing adventure, Blackthorn is a haunting ode."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,75,"Blackthorn imagines a scenario for Butch's later years and gives us a different kind of Western - somber, reflective and set in the elevated plains and salt flats of Bolivia."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,75,"Watching Shepard work his pony down a snaking mountain pass, playing a mandolin and singing the blues, or seeing him sitting, stone-still, beneath a railroad water tank, waiting for something to happen - these are scenes to be cherished, from an actor who has found the soul of the character he's playing."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,75,"Blackthorn is less interested in realism than in elegy, and in bringing this American folk hero in line with the Latin American places and people with whom he ended his days. Given a choice between the legend and the facts, Gil and Barros make up a new legend - and then gild it with light."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,75,"With Paul Newman gone, you couldn't ask for a better senior-citizen representation of Butch Cassidy than Shepard. In his best performance since ""The Right Stuff'' turned him into a reluctant movie star, Shepard makes Blackthorn worth seeing."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,75,"Blackthorn could use more depth and less of a sense of weary inevitability, but it never lacks for the arid, vista-prone beauty of a classic Western, or for a sense of lived-in wear and tear that remains convincing even though it's more stylized than realistic."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,70,"There is that allure of the Old West that is hard to resist, and there's plenty of grist in the story worth milling and mulling."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,70,This modest oater should tickle western fans.
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,70,"The actor (Shepard) delivers a beautifully understated, world-weary turn that largely makes up for the slow-paced film's longueurs, and which in a better film could be described as iconic."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,70,"Shepard delivers in spades, his character weary but just crackpot enough to survive."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,67,"The film has a Leone eye (courtesy of cinematographer Juan Ruiz Anchía) coupled with a drowsy, doomy pace which, emboldened by the salt-licked Bolivian settings and the finely calibrated acting from all, makes for a phantasmagoric trip down a strangely different memory lane."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,60,"Shepard is the whole show here, as weathered and elemental as the harsh Bolivian locations; the movie's best scenes are those that pit him against Stephen Rea as a former Pinkerton man who tracked the outlaws for years and can't believe Cassidy is still drawing breath."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,60,"It's a trenchant modern western and fans of the genre should embrace it for more reasons than just the presence of the epic Sam Shepard who, by the way, owns this Butch Cassidy."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,60,"Director Mateo Gill's autumnal movie has elements of other late-era Westerns in its blood, but it isn't easily pigeonholed. There are shootouts and standoffs, as well as great scenes like one between the grizzled, perfectly cast Shepard and Rea discussing the cost of criminality and the changing morals of old men."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,60,"Gil's alternative history gets one thing bang-on right: If Butch were to live into his senior days, he'd absolutely have to be played by Shepard. Wrinkled, leathery and densely carpeted in a salt-and-pepper beard, the 67-year-old playwright and actor still exudes intellectual mischief and hard-stare sex appeal; his self-styled ruggedness is a perfect match for an infamous gringo living incognito."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,58,The result is a handsome but deeply fractured tale.
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,50,"The first-time director is Mateo Gil, known for the screenplays of ""Open Your Eyes,"" ""The Sea Inside"" and ""Agora."" Ironic, that the film's weakness is its screenplay."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,50,"The movie plods along self-consciously, and when the big twist occurs (you'll most likely see it coming), it complicates the plot, but not Butch, who remains a paragon. That's the problem with Blackthorn: it goes all mushy when contemplating its grizzled, out-of-time hero."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,38,"Blackthorn feels less like a proper sequel to ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" which it purports to be, than a coattail rider."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,38,"Blackthorn's last-man-standing circumstances, far from a cautionary tale about the cost of the gunslinger life, are glorified as the height of macho nobility."
The Return of Swamp Thing,4.6,192816,63,Go Ahead And Scoff. But This cheap-jack sequel to the 1982 cult favorite about a hunky scientist (Dick Durock) turned talking plant delivers more tacky hit-and-miss hilarity than a Cineplex-ful of teen-sex comedies.
The Return of Swamp Thing,4.6,192816,50,"The movie is based on characters that originally appeared in DC Comics, and means to be funnier than it ever is. It almost achieves its comic goal in one scene in which Swamp Thing and Heather Locklear, as Mr. Jourdan's innocent stepdaughter, attempt to consummate a love that cannot be. The film is otherwise composed entirely of special effects that alternate with whimsy."
The Return of Swamp Thing,4.6,192816,50,"With its endless string of good-naturedly cheap jokes and its comic-book style, The Return of Swamp Thing is good campy fun, spoofing its horror premise effectively."
The Return of Swamp Thing,4.6,192816,50,"Apprenticed under Corman, Wynorski is well-versed in double-bluffing his audience, denying them the chance of balking at dreadful special effects by implying that the ineptitude is deliberate. He opts for cheap nostalgic laughs and camp '50s sci-fi scenery; depending on whether you find this funny, you'll either smile knowingly or gasp in disbelief."
The Return of Swamp Thing,4.6,192816,50,The Return of Swamp Thing is scientific hokum without the fun. Second attempt to film the DC Comics character will disappoint all but the youngest critters.
The Return of Swamp Thing,4.6,192816,40,The world can only hope The Swamp Thing's abode is now bulldozered and turned into a shopping mall.
Long men fei jia,6,170276,75,"The story has been brought to the screen twice before (once by Tsui), but this version is the first in IMAX 3-D, which is the main reason to see it."
Long men fei jia,6,170276,75,"Silly, distracting, and undeniably entertaining."
Long men fei jia,6,170276,75,"Tsui Hark's film is the veteran director's chance to let his imagination run riot in the context of a high-budget, 3D IMAX production."
Long men fei jia,6,170276,70,"A chunky spectacle, to be sure – overstuffed with plot and characters - but at times, it's an insanely entertaining one."
Long men fei jia,6,170276,70,"Surprisingly old-fashioned. It seems to be having an argument with itself: the dazzling but often antiseptic immersiveness of the viewing experience is countered by storytelling suffused with nostalgia for a simpler, messier, livelier period in Chinese film."
Long men fei jia,6,170276,60,"Flying Swords might not live up to the promise of Detective Dee, Hark's recent comeback, but it does deliver frequently and always when it counts most."
Long men fei jia,6,170276,50,"The 3D is terrific in Flying Swords of Dragon Gate, but helmer Tsui Hark's costume actioner -- the first Chinese-lingo movie shown in the stereoscopic Imax format -- is let down by two-dimensional characters."
Long men fei jia,6,170276,40,"Flying Swords of Dragon Gate isn't as much fun as the director's previous film – the wondrous ""Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame."""
Long men fei jia,6,170276,40,"Despite the presence of Jet Li, only the last half-hour of this chatty epic truly flies."
Long men fei jia,6,170276,40,"Tsui Hark's films aren't famous for their coherence, but Flying Swords of Dragon Gate is such a wantonly incomprehensible experience that it occasionally feels like an epic piece of outsider art."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,80,Kawajiri's doom-laden action epic is a heady brew indeed.
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,80,Dark fantasy triumphs in this gorgeously animated surrealist adventure.
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,75,"A genre pastiche that's fun to watch, although it's also frustrating."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,75,"Beautiful, witty and provocative, this is one genre film that ought to appeal to fans and non-fans alike."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,75,"The animation is rich and densely detailed, the characters well defined."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,70,"If you appreciate fine animation and edgy material, this blood's for you."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,67,"As usual with anime features, just because it's animated doesn't mean it's for kids; heads roll and blood spurts, so know that going in, mom and dad. For the older crowd, though, it's gory and gorgeous bliss."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,67,"Exciting, gory, funny and, like much of anime, a bit cheesy."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,63,Confusing storytelling and bad dialogue.
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,60,"Handsome, well-executed film that nonetheless feels a bit long at 111 minutes. Those who are already anime fans will certainly find it stimulating; but this may not be the one to convert the uninitiated."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,60,"Doesn't quite scale the heights it could and should, often because of its inappropriate humor, which could be blamed on cultural mistranslation."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,50,"It's a must-see for horror buffs and anime fans; and while it lacks the haunting thematic underpinnings of ""Blood The Last Vampire,"" -- it's a more satisfying movie-going experience."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,50,"A baroque, bloody fantasy-adventure that stubbornly remains less than the sum of its parts."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,50,"The film looks nifty, but the flat and unemotional English-language dialogue lessens its impact."
La scorta,6.8,147394,75,Hits the ground running and never backs off until an ending that is disappointingly diffuse. (Review of Original Release)
La scorta,6.8,147394,70,"Ricky Tognazzi's La Scorta topped the Italian box office charts for weeks, thanks to its skill in capturing the country's current political climate in an entertaining action film format.    (Review of Original Release)"
La scorta,6.8,147394,63,"But exciting as La Scorta might be, it is at heart a conventional thriller that breaks no new genre ground."
La scorta,6.8,147394,60,"Ultimately, La Scorta is a tight, competent but rather inconsequential thriller. It's diverting, but thin. (Review of Original Release)"
La scorta,6.8,147394,50,"Tognazzi's use of public spaces, streets, and offices is three-dimensional and exciting in a Michael Mann–ish way, and Ennio Morricone's all-bass-register piano score keeps things nervous. But La Scorta suffers from an anemic plot pulse-you could say the judge's bodyguards did their job too well, because nothing much happens-and the anticlimax is as dull as it is pessimistic."
Appurushîdo,7,129135,60,"Craft connoisseurs won't be disappointed with the splendidly executed result. However, everyone else is likely to wonder what the fuss about given the plot's dated cyborgs-and-supercomputers hijinks."
Appurushîdo,7,129135,60,The film has enough originality to interest demanding fans of the genre.
Appurushîdo,7,129135,50,Whatever is lost in translation can't keep Appleseed from feeling a decade late--and its animation from looking like a relic on arrival.
Appurushîdo,7,129135,50,"At this point, there's something almost masochistic about the way animators in Japan use cheesy ''Westernized'' heroes to fuel their fantasies."
Appurushîdo,7,129135,50,The characters are (hand-painted) so flat that the film looks like a paper-doll convention at Epcot.
Appurushîdo,7,129135,50,"While there are some genuinely dazzling moments of visual bravura, the marriage of flatness and depth that Mr. Aramaki attempts doesn't quite work."
Appurushîdo,7,129135,50,The stock characters and leaden stretches of expository dialogue are welcome evidence that there's still no computer program capable of telling a decent story.
Appurushîdo,7,129135,50,"Only real fans, however, will be willing to slog through the heaping helpings of incomprehensible exposition."
Appurushîdo,7,129135,50,The film's lingering exploration of their sleek surfaces verges on roboporn.
Appurushîdo,7,129135,40,"Its busy, stiff, artificial graphics are a perfect match for its busy, stiff, artificial plot. A simple Shirow pinup parade might almost be preferable."
Appurushîdo,7,129135,40,"Much of the movie is dull, and as it has been dubbed into English, the blah-blah is impossible to ignore."
Appurushîdo,7,129135,40,"The film's snazzy new automated animation style falls short: The supposedly human face of our metal-plated robocop's partner -- the inevitable curvy female in a leather jump suit -- is an inexpressive, glossy doll mask, untouched by human hands."
Appurushîdo,7,129135,40,"Dazzling visually but is flattened by corny dialogue better suited to the 1936 ""Flash Gordon"" serial, a needlessly hard to follow plot and heavy-handed exposition clotted with pseudo-scientific mumbo jumbo."
Appurushîdo,7,129135,40,"The characters might physically appear rounded, but are otherwise paper-thin."
Appurushîdo,7,129135,38,Lackluster anime.
Appurushîdo,7,129135,25,The visuals are really the only compelling reason to see Appleseed.
Appurushîdo,7,129135,25,Held back by a story and script that is often silly and confusing.
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,91,"The pace is quick, the violence is rough, and the visual style is documentary as Padilha hammers home his point: Someone is forever in the pocket of someone else as The System constantly adapts to protect itself."
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,88,Elite Squad: The Enemy Within is pure pedagogic bliss.
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,80,"Both responding to and rebutting critics who dubbed its predecessor fascist, José Padilha's superior sequel to 2007's ""Elite Squad"" doubles down on the kill-'em-all rhetoric while placing its trigger-happy heroes in a larger context."
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,80,"When this ""Enemy Within"" settles into key action sequences, such as a stunning nighttime ambush or a daytime battle against Fabio, it becomes wildly entertaining."
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,80,"A marked improvement on the first film, it's easy to see why this was such a smash in Brazil. Breathless, brutal and thrilling, it's a gut punch of an action movie."
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,75,"It's fast, it's sure, it's violent and it's fun, even as it sometimes pushes the limits of ready coherence or dramatic plausibility."
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,75,"Propulsive, hyper-violent and ridiculously exciting, Elite Squad: The Enemy Within can be described as ""The Wire"" transplanted to Rio de Janeiro."
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,75,"Here's a Brazilian thriller that's so angry and specifically political, it's hard to believe they got away with making it."
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,75,"A crackling musical score and eye-popping cinematography add to the nonstop ferocity, and Wagner Moura is charismatic as the head of the titular police unit."
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,75,"Padilha's film has a witheringly low opinion of most people - the gangs are no better than animals, the regular police are gleefully corrupt, the liberal intellectuals are sanctimonious fools, and the politicians are only interested in protecting themselves."
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,75,"Padilha channeled national frustrations into zeitgeist entertainment. The follow-up, Elite Squad: The Enemy Within, has less success than the first installment in achieving that aim, but still keeps the snazzy combination of spectacle and polemics in check."
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,70,"This is jammed with cliches but completely engrossing, in the manner of a movie ardently in love with its own bullshit."
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,70,"The carnage, although explicit and frequent, is not grotesquely overdone. But except for Mr. Moura's Nascimento, the movie doesn't have the same richness of characters. Psychologically he is the whole show; the rest are stereotypes."
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,67,"Padilha's film offers no easy answers, but the title is a tip off as to where at least his sympathies lie."
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,63,"Almost everyone is scum. The venality spreads from the slums or favelas, up the ranks of local militias, crooked police and pandering politicians."
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,60,"The rest is an adrenaline ride, but one more wearying than eye-opening."
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,60,The movie's intensity is given crucial depth via Moura's somber and unshowy performance.
Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora é Outro,8,100119,60,Will test the ideological mettle of law-and-order conservatives and lefty peaceniks alike.
Su Qi-er,6.4,80096,75,"If action's your thing, then the Chinese-Hong Kong martial-arts epic True Legend is your movie."
Su Qi-er,6.4,80096,70,"Watching True Legend, a wuxia film crossed with classic vaudeville, it's hard to figure out who's borrowing from whom anymore."
Su Qi-er,6.4,80096,70,"In countless over-the-top set pieces, Yuen delivers striking combat clarity without sacrificing the visceral editing and crazy digital effects of modern bloodbaths."
Su Qi-er,6.4,80096,67,"There is no question that Yuen Woo-ping is a master of his craft, but True Legend leaves doubt as to his mastery of the art of storytelling."
Su Qi-er,6.4,80096,67,True Legend's heart is in the right place. It's just the body that's weary.
Su Qi-er,6.4,80096,60,"Bridged by rude comedy familiar to veteran viewers of Hong Kong martial arts cinema, True Legend is refreshingly unpretentious in comparison to the pompous nationalism of recent Chinese war spectacles like ""The Warring States."""
Su Qi-er,6.4,80096,60,"A hodgepodge of styles, True Legend works best as a freewheeling showcase for Yuen's dazzling fight sequences above any sort of cogent storytelling."
Su Qi-er,6.4,80096,60,"After a stirring opening battle, however, the fights in True Legend become pretty routine. And beyond some lovely mountain scenery and a tiny cameo by a radiant Michelle Yeoh, there isn't much else to look at."
Su Qi-er,6.4,80096,60,"Whereas Yuen's speciality has always been gonzo, gravity-defying spectacles, now he's spiced his set pieces with plasticine computer-generated flourishes-effectively puncturing the inventive, handmade charm and fluid flurries of artistry that made his classic fight scenes so thrilling."
Su Qi-er,6.4,80096,50,"The story is painfully simplistic, and it becomes quickly apparent that the narrative is a crude cement to hold together the carnage."
Tian jiang xiong shi,6,74068,80,"The writer-director has overcome his tendency to weave florid plots that quickly run out of steam, here forging a coherent narrative that’s strong on physical and emotional drive."
Tian jiang xiong shi,6,74068,75,"Daniel Lee’s elaborate Chinese historical action epic Dragon Blade certainly gets points for creative casting, as well as its gorgeous widescreen visuals."
Tian jiang xiong shi,6,74068,70,"Committed performances, a hefty budget and assured hands behind the camera ensure that Dragon Blade delivers on its promise of sprawling battle scenes, intriguing culture clashes and budding bromances, where its giddily high concept and unlikely casting may so easily have seen it fail."
Tian jiang xiong shi,6,74068,60,Exerting significant control over the film – from a screenplay filled with modern resonance to very effective production design – Lee just barely manages to overcome the jarring problem posed by its (mugging) American cast.
Tian jiang xiong shi,6,74068,50,"There are alliances and betrayals aplenty, but writer/director Daniel Lee seems more concerned with establishing and maintaining an epic look and feel than in providing cohesion to the narrative."
Tian jiang xiong shi,6,74068,50,"Whether it’s introducing random flashes of white screen or slowing down shots to a stuttered chop, Dragon Blade seems to be going out of its way to make sure the action never rises above the level of “watchable enough.”"
Tian jiang xiong shi,6,74068,50,"The picture never quite finds its tone: It's neither go-for-broke outrageous enough to be consistently funny, nor energetic enough to be viscerally entertaining. It's neither as bad as you might fear, nor as much fun as you might hope."
Tian jiang xiong shi,6,74068,30,"The movie's grandiose emotional quotient never feels any more real than its ham-fisted dialogue, dubious accents, strained ""Kumbaya"" moments or eclectic hairdos."
Tian jiang xiong shi,6,74068,30,"As Tiberius, who seems not to have been based on any Tiberius of history, Mr. Brody brings to the film a combination of heroin-chic and Basil Rathbone. Also, an extraordinary level of sadistic cruelty. People are burned alive, crushed like insects, hurled from rooftops. They may not deserve all this. But neither do we."
Tian jiang xiong shi,6,74068,30,"Dragon Blade is the kind of nutsy maximalist entertainment that isn’t content merely to tap a handful of influences. Instead, it stuffs an entire encyclopedia of dicey ideas (visual, narrative, political) into a blender to create a wacky, eyeball-popping and -glazing extravaganza."
Tian jiang xiong shi,6,74068,20,"An epic in China, it’s been trimmed here in the States. But this movie didn’t need a cut, it needed a beheading."
Tian jiang xiong shi,6,74068,12,"Slacker and even less involving than the similarly terrible global kill-fest Last Knights, but easier to watch for the inadvertent camp value of two of the prominent performances."
Rang zi dan fei,7.4,63012,90,It is marvelously funny - a screwball comedy with more layers than a pearl - and visually sumptuous.
Rang zi dan fei,7.4,63012,80,"Between the kung fu, the gunplay, a gentle romantic subplot and the extreme gastronomy – there's something for everyone."
Rang zi dan fei,7.4,63012,80,"This period action comedy by Jiang Wen (Devils on the Doorstep) is great fun in the Shakespearean tradition, stuffed with lively characters, dramatic stand-offs, and stolen-identity subplots."
Rang zi dan fei,7.4,63012,80,Comedy and shifting-allegiances intrigue more than compensate for the dearth of rousing action in this 1920s-set film.
Rang zi dan fei,7.4,63012,80,"A rollicking, violent, Western-cum-comedy that serves many masters, but adds up to an entertaining hot pot of wry political commentary and general mischief."
Rang zi dan fei,7.4,63012,75,Let the Bullets Fly is an intentionally overheated and very funny comedy about how the best-laid plans tend to fall apart in spectacular fashion.
Rang zi dan fei,7.4,63012,70,"As an allegory on power, corruption and rough justice, it has flashes of intelligence and political acumen."
Rang zi dan fei,7.4,63012,67,"That dedicated wryness makes the endless twists and betrayals easier to process-these are awful people, but it's sure a lot of fun to watch them fight it out."
Rang zi dan fei,7.4,63012,63,"Low on nuance and high on body count, the movie is primarily of interest to fans of Asian action spectacles and followers of the charismatic Chow Yun-fat (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), here cast as both a dandyish villain and his idiotic double."
Rang zi dan fei,7.4,63012,60,A good-natured and highly enjoyable goof.
Rang zi dan fei,7.4,63012,60,It's best to just let the silly-to-spectacular set pieces fly by you and-tastes permitting-enjoy the Karo Syrupped ridiculousness on display.
Rang zi dan fei,7.4,63012,50,"At 132 minutes, the film is at least half an hour too long. Nobody asked me, but the best solution would be to keep the action sequences (such as the robbery of a horse-drawn steam train, an homage to Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West''), and scrap the allegedly ""witty'' dialogue and difficult-to-follow plot twists."
Rang zi dan fei,7.4,63012,50,"Even with three charismatic leads, the talky, convoluted nature of the cat-and-mouse between Zhang and Huang and their respective gangs is impossible to follow or care about, and the mix of identity comedy, cartoonish violence, philosophizing and grief over killed loved ones is hardly smooth."
Rang zi dan fei,7.4,63012,50,"At least 30 minutes and several scams too long, the plot passes from amusing to confounding long before the final double-cross."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,70,"Home of the Brave isn't exactly a subtle or a delicate picture -- it's an old-fashioned Hollywood movie, at least in tone, that's being released like an indie -- but it has some terrific acting and comes straight from the heart."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,63,"While Mark Friedman's script is as unsubtle as Winkler's direction, their sincerity and the subject's sharp immediacy lend the film a certain power."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,60,"Timeliness is all very well, but the significant subject matter cries out for a defter directorial touch and a deeper complexity in regard to the characters and performances."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,50,"Evenness of political keel, combined with a generic filmmaking style, is an artistic weapon way too puny for a successful assault on so tough, bruising, and crucial a subject."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,50,"Had Home of the Brave presented credible stories about believable characters, it might have been a powerful drama."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,50,"Home of the Brave is a milestone of sorts. But it's a formulaic, overacted piece of work that rarely delves deep."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,50,"The movie's mild-mannerness is especially disappointing when compared with such documentaries as ""The War Tapes"" and the excellent ""Home Front,"" vivid and incisive explorations of post-Iraq anger and disillusionment that have gone largely unseen by a disinterested public. If Americans are suffering from Iraq fatigue, Home of the Brave will do little to rouse them."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,50,"Starts with a bang and ends in a long, protracted whimper."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,50,"The best thing about the movie is that it's interested in the soldiers, not the self-serving popinjays who seem to think the war is a big fat career-enhancing photo opportunity. The people who got shot at deserve most of the attention."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,40,As sincere as a three-legged puppy.
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,40,"As this cautious, politically evenhanded movie grinds along like clockwork, the fuse that should spark an emotional explosion fizzles after some sporadic hisses and sputters."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,38,The apolitical and well-meaning Home of the Brave is predictable and maudlin.
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,38,"By straining to make a respectful war film for everyone, Winkler and Friedman have wound up with a toothless picture that won't satisfy anyone."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,33,"Whatever its model, the film is assembled from much poorer material, leftover parts of Lifetime movies and well-meaning indie films seen only on opening nights at some forgotten festival in Tampa."
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,91,Possibly the best war movie of the year.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,90,Danfung Dennis presents a powerful depiction of the horrors and daily violence of our ongoing war in Afghanistan.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,90,"Similar in its battlefield passages to last year's Danish-made ""Armadillo,"" Dennis' film scores a layered perspective that follows Marine Sgt. Nathan Harris into combat and back home."
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,88,"In its closing scenes, Hell and Back Again builds to an emotional and stylistic power that we didn't see coming."
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,88,Dennis's film attempts something few documentaries have: to inhabit the psyche of its subject.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,88,"A superb, violent, jarring and daring documentary."
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,80,"This structure persuasively depicts combat and recovery as two sides of the same struggle, and Dennis strengthens his argument by maintaining a constant perspective throughout: the camera is always within a few feet of the subject."
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,80,A tough but deeply rewarding watch. Search it out.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,80,"As vital as the best war chronicles to come out in recent years, this is one every American ought to see."
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,80,Watching the formerly spry Harris struggle to maintain a normal life (he's frequently glassy-eyed and jacked on painkillers) emphasizes the underappreciated sacrifices our men and women in uniform make in the name of vaguely defined ideals.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,80,You can feel just how jarring and stressful it must be for a soldier to go from the life-and-death adrenaline rush of war to the maddeningly slow world of rehabilitation and forced inactivity.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,80,"Working alone with a camera and his ingenuity, Dennis captured the surreality of firefights with an invisible enemy and the frustration of displaced civilians."
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,75,Dennis refuses to push a political agenda down viewers' throats. But the message of his film -- a breathlessly paced look at the realities of war -- is clear: War and its aftermath are indeed hell.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,75,The documentary Hell and Back Again may be the closest most civilians ever get to the reality of the war in Afghanistan.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,75,"The film portrays the dizzying divide between war and recovery eloquently enough that those choices seem like intrusions instead of connections, a misstep in what's otherwise a devastating profile of a soldier."
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,75,The film suggests that it doesn't really matter whether Harris ever gets back in uniform. He's forever carrying around a piece of unexploded ordnance in his head.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,63,"Unlike most war documentaries, which tend to only skim the surface of its gun-toting subjects' lives, photojournalist Danfung Dennis's Hell and Back Again isn't content to merely capture warriors in combat."
Yip Man: Jung gik yat zin,6.2,37884,75,"The world may not get another Ip Man film for a while after the last few years, but this one and Wong’s masterpiece should be more than sufficient."
Yip Man: Jung gik yat zin,6.2,37884,70,"Wong is such a fine, subtle actor that it comes as a surprise to find him a superb martial artist as well, as he convincingly demonstrates the superiority of Ip Man’s technique over competing schools."
Yip Man: Jung gik yat zin,6.2,37884,70,"Not quite a biopic, the film presents an overview of Ip's years in Hong Kong; Anthony Wong's dignified performance begins with the grandmaster almost fully formed."
Yip Man: Jung gik yat zin,6.2,37884,63,"The filmmakers fall over themselves trying to respect Man's outlook on life, and this makes their subject seem more like a hyper-disciplined saint than a world-reknowned, ass-kicking hermit."
Yip Man: Jung gik yat zin,6.2,37884,63,"As a character study, Ip Man: The Final Fight would be more convincing if it didn’t look so distractingly like a Hollywood musical."
Yip Man: Jung gik yat zin,6.2,37884,63,"Anthony Wong does a creditable job of conveying Ip Man's reflectiveness through his twilight years, occasionally cutting through the hagiographic nature of the enterprise."
Yip Man: Jung gik yat zin,6.2,37884,60,"Seriously, if not always elegantly, the film portrays the great Ip Man as someone trying to survive, which is to say just as often a victim as a victor."
Yip Man: Jung gik yat zin,6.2,37884,50,"The overall sense is of a rushed, simplistic installment in a well-worn biography franchise."
Yip Man: Jung gik yat zin,6.2,37884,50,This is the rare martial-arts film where the martial arts are tedious and the conversations more compelling.
Yip Man: Jung gik yat zin,6.2,37884,33,"From fawning beginning to maudlin close, it’s a monotonous, wannabe-mythmaking biopic for Ip completists only."
Broken Horses,5.7,35000,60,"While Chopra attempts to crack the American market with a slice of cinematic apple pie, he holds up a mirror to how Hollywood's tried-and-true narrative of vigilantism connotes who we are, at home and overseas."
Broken Horses,5.7,35000,50,"The film is fun and extreme, and though in the end rather pointless, there’s a certain audacity here — a delight in extremity — that’s appealing."
Broken Horses,5.7,35000,38,"Broken Horses raises the question of what is cockamamie, and what is cockamamie and outlandish and ridiculous yet a perfectly swell time for those very reasons.
This one's just cockamamie without the swell part."
Broken Horses,5.7,35000,38,"The bloodshed is artful, at least."
Broken Horses,5.7,35000,33,"Very loosely inspired by Chopra’s 1989 feature ""Parinda,"" this wan crime drama plays like the equivalent of a Hindi novel that’s been run through Google Translate. Everything feels rudimentary and slightly awkward, though it’s possible to discern how the material might once have been powerful."
Broken Horses,5.7,35000,30,A deeply silly drama of corrupted innocence.
Broken Horses,5.7,35000,30,"Notable Bollywood producer-director Vidhu Vinod Chopra makes a highly uneasy transition to American films with this weirdly baroque modern-day Western that, while it boasts undeniably imaginative visual and plot flourishes, is far too absurd to take seriously."
Broken Horses,5.7,35000,30,"Fails to convince on several crucial levels, including plotting and dialogue."
Broken Horses,5.7,35000,20,"Try as they might to make sense of their characters, Chopra’s actors are unanimously defeated by the oft-embarrassing dialogue they’re given to recite."
Xi you: Xiang mo pian,6.8,18058,91,"Chow's specialty is over-the-top slapstick action in the Hong Kong style, and the new film doesn't disappoint on either count."
Xi you: Xiang mo pian,6.8,18058,80,"Chow is at his best when juggling disparate elements – tragedy, slapstick, romance, melancholy, fantasy. Everything is big with him; he seems incapable of underplaying anything. The crazier his movies, the better. And Journey to the West might be the craziest thing he’s done yet. You may wonder, afterwards, if you dreamt it all."
Xi you: Xiang mo pian,6.8,18058,80,"The spectacular combination of slapstick, love story and superhero antics doesn't entirely avoid awkwardness, but mostly it defies gravity, like many of the stunts."
Xi you: Xiang mo pian,6.8,18058,75,A huge hit in China — where it was released in 3-D IMAX — the handsomely filmed Journey To the West deserves better than the token 2-D theatrical release it’s getting in the United States to support its simultaneous arrival on video-on-demand.
Xi you: Xiang mo pian,6.8,18058,75,Showcases Chow at his weirdest and most entertaining.
Xi you: Xiang mo pian,6.8,18058,75,"Stephen Chow's distinctive vision is evident in the seemingly boundless imagination of his scenarios, and in the film's sincere spiritual concerns and generosity toward misfits and outsiders."
Xi you: Xiang mo pian,6.8,18058,70,"Journey to the West may not rank among Chow’s classics, but it’s a crowd-pleaser that also serves as a reminder of what the director can accomplish when he’s on his game."
Xi you: Xiang mo pian,6.8,18058,70,"Mr. Chow has perhaps achieved more sustained and elaborate adventures, but he hits a sweet spot of comedy that never grows too self-aware or forgets the value of a good, clean demon whomping."
Xi you: Xiang mo pian,6.8,18058,63,"By turns daffy and dazzling, awkward and artful, Journey to the West takes an ancient tale and gives it contemporary flair."
Xi you: Xiang mo pian,6.8,18058,60,[A] mostly entertaining action-fantasy-comedy.
Xi you: Xiang mo pian,6.8,18058,60,"Chow’s movies are always as sweet as they are silly, a combination he once again balances — alongside cool effects — with typically deft irreverence."
Xi you: Xiang mo pian,6.8,18058,60,"Chow’s go-for-broke sensibility has been sorely missed, and a tale of demons is the ideal context for the gravity-defying, logic-impaired stunts he favors."
Xi you: Xiang mo pian,6.8,18058,50,The camera swoops and whooshes about but never generates any compelling energy — Chow's film proves endlessly manic but devoid of much mirth.
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,91,It may very well be the best action movie of the year.
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,91,Hyams delivers a remarkably satisfying action-thriller hybrid that constantly pushes ahead. It's one of the best action movies of the year simply because it keeps hitting the right beats.
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,75,"An intensity of purpose and a patient, suspenseful directing style make the B-movie Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning superior to most of the big-budget action films I've seen lately."
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,70,"Hyams's film, which may at first seem like a glorified VOD entry in a forgotten franchise starring has-been action stars, is an admirably tense sci-fi/horror adventure that somehow turns its considerable limitations into virtues."
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,70,"Against the prevailing cheerlessness, these intensively choreographed fights, many shot in audacious, roving single takes, are like glimpses into a dream world."
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,70,"Playing like a mash-up between ""Enter the Void"" and ""The Raid,"" Day of Reckoning is an uncommonly assured slice of bargain bin cinema, as arresting to watch as it is impossible to comprehend."
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,70,"There's something perversely fascinating about helmer John Hyams' freewheeling yet deliberately paced mashup of noirish mystery, splatter-movie intensity, first-person-shooter vidgame and ""Apocalypse Now""-style surrealism."
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,60,"The movie creates something of the sensation of huffing industrial solvents - in a good way! - a waking-sleep zombification that can't exactly be described as pleasurable but definitely has an odd, distinct power."
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,60,"This bloody wallow in sweat, guns and fisticuffs - for those who swing that way - delivers."
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,60,"Say what you will about the confused narrative, blatant borrowings and wildly over-the-top gory violence of Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning -- at least you can see what the hell is going on."
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,60,It's almost worth wading through the wearisome setup to get to the fun stuff. But there is a reason fast-forward buttons were invented.
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,58,Consider this a public service announcement: Folks who have a problem with onscreen flesh-hacking - or the fact that franchise stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren aren't in the movie all that much - should stay home.
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,50,"As with all the films in the Universal Soldier series, this is mostly a catalog of increasingly brutal fights, which are the main attraction in and of themselves."
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,50,"Like a stiff Schwarzeneggerian conqueror making good on an ""I'll be back,"" John Hyams returns to one-up the franchise again."
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,45,"In the least, and most significantly, Day of Reckoning should propel British martial artist/stunt veteran Adkins out of the niche genre world - action cinema's Adkins diet?"
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,40,"It's up to you to decide if his oddly artsy vision, which pulls in first-person perspectives, surreal memories and highbrow cinematic references, suggests interesting ambition or misplaced pretension."
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,25,The latest undead-soldier story carries on the franchise tradition of graphic violence and bad acting.
Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,5.1,5460,20,"The fight sequences are briskly choreographed at least, gruesome though they are -- and, to be honest, that goes a long way in a film such as this. In fact they may be the only reason to see it, other than the chance to see Van Damme in full Col. Kurtz mode, all face-painted and droopy-eyed and bat-poop crazy."
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,60,"Crispian Mills directs with zip, throwing things together with a breathlessness that largely distracts from the fact that, for a horror-comedy, Slaughterhouse Rulez is neither particularly scary nor especially funny. But it does have an amiable sort of charm."
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,40,Mills stages the B-movie mayhem with gleeful abandon and geysers of blood.
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,40,"The school isn’t specific enough and the horror isn’t weird enough: on both fronts, it’s so broad it could practically be a Norfolk waterway."
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,40,This sloppy horror comedy under delivers on both shocks and laughs.
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,40,"Showing more enthusiasm than aptitude, this earns ‘could do better if it tried’ on its report card — but it’s a strange enough genre mix to be vaguely worth a look."
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,40,"There’s nothing particularly awful about the film (title aside), but it never develops into the “Shaun of the Dead”-like social satire it strains to be."
Reclaim,5.1,3600,50,This isn’t activism; it’s by-the-numbers suspense.
Reclaim,5.1,3600,40,"By trying to have it both ways—goosing up black-market trafficking for cheap thrills, while posing as being sincere about a real global scourge—the film winds up stuck in the middle."
Reclaim,5.1,3600,40,Alan White’s polished but pedestrian pic mines little real suspense and few surprises from a formulaic script.
Reclaim,5.1,3600,30,"Carmine Gaeta and Luke Davies' screenplay is constructed from plot mechanics, and the emotional stakes grow less convincing with every twist of the screw."
Reclaim,5.1,3600,30,"And to be fair, Cusack doesn’t phone it in. He gives the part his all, displaying his usual expert deadpan comic timing while delivering the weak quips in Carmine Gaeta and Luke Davies’ screenplay. But it’s disheartening nonetheless to see him working so hard to enliven such inferior material."
Reclaim,5.1,3600,20,"There are no twists or even surprises, except the final realization that director Alan White is taking his culturally clueless, ineptly shot B-movie totally seriously. Judging from the uniformly underwhelming performances, he’s the only one."
Reclaim,5.1,3600,12,Reclaim's highly mechanized plot ensures that the film is over before it even ends.
